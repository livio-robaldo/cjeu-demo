    <!-- The reason is that we want the SDFRule to execute only on the first node in the signatures at the end of the conclusions. Otherwise, an SDFRule will trigger 
         for each node in the signature. And, when we will make the intersection of the ArrayList<SDFHead>(s), it could happen that one ArrayList<SDFHead>, triggered 
         by an SDFHead in the middle of the signature delete all the others with which it intersects, so that it is chosen as the "winner". To avoid this, we only want 
         the one starting on the first word of the signature to be the "winner" -->
