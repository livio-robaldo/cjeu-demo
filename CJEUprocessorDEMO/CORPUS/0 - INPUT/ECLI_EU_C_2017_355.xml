On the same grounds as those established by the Court of Justice in that judgment, the referring court finds that the additional contribution at the rate of 1.1% must also be regarded as falling within the scope of the regulation.

          Secondly, an EU official may have the status of a migrant worker for the purposes of Article 45 TFEU as a national of a Member State working in the territory of a Member State other than his or her State of origin. However, the fact nevertheless remains that, in so far as EU officials are not subject to national legislation on social security, as referred to in Article 2(1) of Regulation No 1408/71 and in the same article of Regulation No 883/2004, which defines the persons covered by those regulations, they cannot be characterised as ‘workers’ within the meaning of those provisions. Nor are they covered, in that context, by Article 48 TFEU, which conferred on the Council the task of instituting a scheme allowing workers to overcome any obstacles which may arise for them from national rules in the field of social security, a task which the Council fulfilled by adopting Regulation No 1408/71 and, subsequently, Regulation No 883/2004 (see, to that effect, judgments of 3 October 2000, Ferlini,

          The foregoing analysis is not called in question by the French Government’s claims that the contributions and social levies at issue in the main proceedings are classified as ‘taxes’ that are levied on income from real estate, not on earned income, and which do not directly give rise to any benefits in return or to any advantage in terms of social security benefits. In fact, as is apparent from the information provided by the referring court, those levies and contributions are in any event allocated specifically and directly for the funding of certain branches of the French social security scheme. An EU official such as Mr de Lobkowicz cannot, accordingly, be subject to those levies and contributions since his financial obligations in matters of social security are governed exclusively by the Protocol and the Staff Regulations and, as such, fall outside the jurisdiction of the Member States (see, by analogy, with regard to Regulation No 1408/71, judgment of 26 February 2015, de Ruyter,
