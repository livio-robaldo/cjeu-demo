In such a situation, the market value of the transferred assets, like the provisions deducted previously in the taxation in Finland of that permanent establishment, are included in the permanent establishment’s taxable income in the tax year in which the transfer takes place. The tax due in Finland on the income to be realised is reduced by the tax which would be levied on the same income in the Member State of the permanent establishment if the directive did not apply.</p>

          According to the Court’s case-law, operations covered by the Mergers Directive are a particular method of exercise of the freedom of establishment, important for the proper functioning of the internal market, and are therefore economic activities in respect of which the Member States are required to comply with that freedom (see, to that effect, judgment of 8 March 2017, Euro Park Service,

          It is settled case-law of the Court that Article 49 TFEU requires the abolition of restrictions of freedom of establishment. Even though, according to their wording, the provisions of the FEU Treaty on freedom of establishment are aimed at ensuring that foreign nationals are treated in the host Member State in the same way as nationals of that State, they also prohibit the Member State of origin from hindering the establishment in another Member State of one of its nationals or of a company incorporated under its legislation (judgment of 8 March 2017, Euro Park Service,

          As to whether the situations are comparable, it must be stated that, with reference to legislation of a Member State which seeks to tax capital gains generated within its tax jurisdiction, the situation of a company which, in the course of a transfer of assets, transfers a non-resident permanent establishment to a company that is also non-resident is, as regards the taxation of the capital gains of that permanent establishment which were generated within the tax jurisdiction of that Member State before the transfer, comparable to that of a resident company which, in the course of a transfer of assets, transfers a permanent establishment to another resident company (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 May 2015, Verder LabTec,

          Second, in accordance with the principle of fiscal territoriality, a Member State is entitled, in the case of a transfer of a non-resident permanent establishment to a non-resident company by way of a transfer of assets, to charge tax at the time of the transfer on the capital gains generated within its tax jurisdiction before the transfer.

          It has been held, second, that legislation of a Member State offering a taxpayer the choice between immediate payment of tax, which creates a disadvantage for the taxpayer in terms of cash flow but frees it from subsequent administrative burdens, and deferred payment of tax, possibly together with interest in accordance with the applicable national legislation, which necessarily involves an administrative burden for the taxpayer in connection with tracing the transferred assets, constitutes a measure which, while being appropriate for ensuring the balanced allocation of powers of taxation between the Member States, is less harmful to freedom of establishment than immediate collection of the tax due (see, to that effect, judgment of 29 November 2011, National Grid Indus,

          As regards the administrative burden, the Court has explained that the taxpayer should be given the option to choose between, on the one hand, bearing the administrative burden relating to deferred payment of tax and, on the other, immediate collection of the tax.

          That assessment cannot be called in question by the fact that the legislation, pursuant to Article 10(2) of the Mergers Directive, gives relief for the tax that, but for the provisions of that directive, would have been charged on such capital gains in the Member State in which the non-resident permanent establishment is situated, given that the disproportionality of that legislation does not derive from the amount of tax due but from the fact that it makes no provision for the taxpayer to defer the time at which it is collected (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 September 2017, Trustees of the P Panayi Accumulation &amp;amp; Maintenance Settlements,

          As regards the justification based on the need to ensure the effective collection of tax, raised by the German and Swedish Governments, it should be observed that, while the Court has previously accepted that it may constitute an overriding reason of the public interest capable of justifying a restriction of the freedoms of movement guaranteed by the FEU Treaty (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 June 2014, Strojírny Prostějov and ACO Industries Tábor,

          and the case-law cited), the legislation at issue in the main proceedings is not appropriate for attaining it, so that that objective cannot, in a case such as that in the main proceedings, justify an impediment to freedom of establishment. As the Commission observed, for a Member State to allow a resident transferring company to opt for deferred payment of tax would not affect that Member State’s possibility of requesting from that company the necessary information for collecting the tax due or of proceeding effectively to collecting it (see, by analogy, judgment of 19 June 2014, Strojírny Prostějov and ACO Industries Tábor,
