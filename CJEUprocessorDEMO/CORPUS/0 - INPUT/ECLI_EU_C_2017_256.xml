Those breaches related to the fact that the Ombudsman had (i) distorted the content of an opinion of the Parliament; (ii) failed to fulfil the duty to act diligently in the context of the investigation to determine whether the information that Ms Staelen’s name had been placed on the list of suitable candidates had been circulated by the Parliament to the other institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the European Union; and (iii) also failed to fulfil that duty in the context of the Ombudsman’s inquiry to determine whether the Parliament had communicated that information to its own directorates-general.</p>

That sufficiently serious breach arose from the fact that the Ombudsman had concluded that there was no maladministration on the part of the Parliament, having relied in that regard on nothing more than a statement by the Parliament concerning the period of time for which the other successful candidates were included on the list of suitable candidates and having received no evidence of the dates of recruitment of those successful candidates, a statement which, it subsequently transpired, was incorrect.</p>

          As regards the possibility that a person who has referred a complaint to the Ombudsman may put in issue the European Union’s liability because of the way in which that complaint has been handled, the Court of Justice has already stated that it is appropriate to refer to its settled case-law, according to which a right to reparation is afforded where three conditions are met: the rule of law infringed must be intended to confer rights on individuals; the breach must be sufficiently serious; and there must be a direct causal link between the breach of the obligation on the author of the act and the damage sustained by the injured party. As to the second condition, the Court has, in the same context, also noted that the decisive test for finding that a breach of EU law is sufficiently serious is whether the EU institution or body concerned manifestly and gravely disregarded the limits on its discretion (judgment of 23 March 2004, Ombudsman v Lamberts,

          The Court has also made clear, in respect to that last point, that, in order to determine whether there has been a sufficiently serious breach of EU law rendering the European Union non-contractually liable as a result of the conduct of the Ombudsman, regard must be had to the particular nature of the latter’s functions. In that context, it should be borne in mind that the Ombudsman is merely under an obligation to use her best endeavours and enjoys wide discretion (judgment of 23 March 2004, Ombudsman v Lamberts,

          The Court has held, furthermore, that, although the Ombudsman enjoys very wide discretion as regards the merits of complaints and the way in which they are to be dealt with, and, in that context, is under no obligation as to the result to be achieved, even if review by the Courts of the European Union must consequently be limited, it is nevertheless possible that in very exceptional circumstances a person may be able to demonstrate that the Ombudsman has committed a sufficiently serious breach of EU law in the performance of her duties that is liable to cause damage to the citizen concerned (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 March 2004, Ombudsman v Lamberts,

          In stating, in paragraph 86 of the judgment under appeal, that the Ombudsman did not have any discretion concerning respect for the principle of diligence in a specific case, before going on to infer from this that a mere breach of that principle was therefore sufficient to establish the sufficiently serious nature of that breach, the General Court clearly intended to draw on the case-law of the Court, referred to in paragraph 71 of the judgment under appeal, according to which, where an EU institution has only considerably reduced, or even no, discretion, the mere infringement of EU law may suffice to establish the existence of a sufficiently serious breach of that law (see, in particular, judgment of 10 December 2002, Commission v Camar and Tico,

          However, the General Court could not thereby decide that the conditions under which the European Union incurs non-contractual liability on the basis of a breach of the duty to act diligently were satisfied without taking into consideration the field or the circumstances or the context in which that duty was imposed on the EU institution or body concerned (see, to that effect, judgment of 30 January 1992, Finsider and Others v Commission,

          In order for it to be concluded that there is a sufficiently serious breach of the Ombudsman’s duty to act diligently, it is therefore necessary to establish that, by failing to act with all the requisite care and caution, the Ombudsman gravely and manifestly disregarded the limits on her discretion in the exercise of her powers of investigation. Whilst having regard to that context, account must, to that end, be taken of all aspects characterising the situation concerned, including, in particular, the obviousness of the lack of care shown by the Ombudsman in the conduct of the investigation (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgments of 30 January 1992, Finsider and Others v Commission,

          As regards the admissibility of the second, third and fourth parts of the first ground of appeal, it is important to note that, according to the settled case-law of the Court of Justice, it is clear from the second subparagraph of Article 256(1) TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union that the General Court has exclusive jurisdiction, first, to find the facts, except where the substantive inaccuracy of its findings is apparent from the documents submitted to it, and, second, to assess those facts. By contrast, when the General Court has found or assessed the facts, the Court of Justice has jurisdiction to review the legal characterisation of those facts by the General Court and the legal conclusions it has drawn from them (see, in particular, judgment of 3 September 2009, Moser Baer India v Council,
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2009%3A498&amp;locale=en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch" hreflang="en" class="CourtLink">C‑535/06 P</a>

          and the case-law cited). Thus, the Court of Justice has repeatedly observed that the question whether the General Court could, properly in law, conclude from those facts that the EU institutions had failed in their duty to act diligently is a question of law subject to the review of the Court of Justice on appeal (see, in particular, judgment of 3 September 2009, Moser Baer India v Council,

          and the case-law cited). The same applies when determining whether such a failure is, moreover, to be classified as a ‘sufficiently serious breach’ of EU law, and one that may give rise to the European Union’s non-contractual liability.

Consequently, the General Court was entitled, having regard to the case-law referred to in paragraph 39 of the present judgment, to rule, in paragraph 142 of the judgment under appeal, that the Ombudsman’s distortion of the content of the Parliament’s opinion of 20 March 2007 constituted a sufficiently serious breach capable of rendering the European Union liable.</p>
