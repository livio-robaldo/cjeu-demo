          As regards Directive 2010/18 and the revised Framework Agreement, the Verwaltungsgericht Berlin (Administrative Court, Berlin) is uncertain, in particular, whether Paragraph 97 of the LBG is compatible with Clause 5(1) of the framework agreement, because, on expiry of her parental leave, Ms H. could not return to the post she had occupied before that leave or an equivalent post, but was reassigned to a post of lower status. That court also questions the compatibility of Paragraph 97 with Clause 5(2) of the Framework Agreement, which provides for the maintenance of rights acquired or in the process of being acquired, because that reassignment results in a reduction of salary. It cannot however be ruled out, in the court’s view, that, as the
          <span class="italic">Land</span>
          of Berlin submits, the rules laid down by Paragraph 97 of the LBG may constitute national law within the meaning of the second sentence of Clause 5(2) of the Framework Agreement, from which, at the end of parental leave, changes to her worker’s rights could legitimately arise.

However, it also asks which solution should be adopted if no similar post were available. Finally, to the extent that the national law requires, when a new post is assigned, a new selection procedure to be held, with the risk in that case that a candidate other than the civil servant returning from parental leave should be retained, the referring court is uncertain as to whether EU law requires that such a procedure should not be held.</p>

          Moreover, the objectives thus pursued by the revised Framework Agreement are associated with the improvement of living and working conditions and with the existence of proper social protection for workers, which, as is apparent from Article 151 TFEU, are included among the objectives pursued by EU social policy (see, to that effect, as regards the 1995 Framework Agreement, judgment of 22 October 2009, Meerts,

          Finally, it should be recalled that the revised Framework Agreement, like the 1995 Framework Agreement, is intended also to apply to workers who, like the applicant in the main proceedings, have the status of civil servant. Clause 1(2) of the revised Framework Agreement covers generally ‘all workers … who have an employment contract or employment relationship as defined by the law, collective agreements and/or practice in force in each Member State’ and Clause 2(1) of the Framework Agreement covers ‘workers’, without drawing a distinction according to whether their employer is in the public or private sector, thereby encompassing all workers (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 September 2010, Chatzi,

          It is important to note, first of all, that paragraphs 1 to 3 of Clause 5 of the revised Framework Agreement are worded in terms almost identical to those of paragraphs 5 to 7 of Clause 2 of the 1995 Framework Agreement, with the result that the interpretation given by the Court concerning the latter provisions are also valid in relation to the former (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 June 2016, Rodríguez Sánchez,

          With a view to enabling new parents to interrupt their professional activities to devote themselves to their family responsibilities, the revised Framework Agreement gives them the assurance, set out in Clause 5(1) of that framework agreement, that they will return to the same job or, if that is not possible, to an equivalent or similar job consistent with their employment contract or relationship at the end of parental leave. That provision therefore guarantees the return to the job at the end of the leave on the same conditions as those existing when the leave was taken (see, to that effect, judgment of 13 February 2014, TSN and YTN,

          In the same vein, the first sentence of Clause 5(2) is intended to avoid the loss of or reduction in rights derived from an employment relationship, acquired or being acquired, to which the worker is entitled when he starts parental leave, and to ensure that, at the end of that leave, with regard to those rights, he will find himself in the same situation as that in which he was before the leave (see, to that effect, judgments of 16 July 2009, Gómez-Limón Sánchez-Camacho,

The infringements of that clause cannot be justified by the objective pursued by the probationary period, which is to enable the assessment of suitability for the managerial post to be assigned permanently.</p>

          A preliminary point to note is that the Court has consistently held that when national courts apply domestic law they are bound to interpret that law, so far as possible, in the light of the wording and the purpose of the directive concerned in order to achieve the result sought by the directive and, consequently, comply with the third paragraph of Article 288 TFEU (see, inter alia, judgment of 24 January 2012, Dominguez,

          In those circumstances, it should also be recalled that, as is clear from settled case-law, wherever the provisions of a directive appear, as far as their subject matter is concerned, to be unconditional and sufficiently precise, those provisions may be relied upon by individuals as against the Member State, particularly in its capacity as an employer. Moreover, the Court has previously held that that case-law can be applied to agreements which, like the framework agreements on parental leave, are the product of a dialogue between management and labour at EU level and have been implemented, in accordance with their legal basis, by a directive of the Council, of which they are thus an integral component (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 April 2010, Zentralbetriebsrat der Landeskrankenhäuser Tirols,

          Clause 5(1) and (2), first sentence, of the revised Framework Agreement assures, generally and in unequivocal terms, the worker’s rights to return to the same job or, if that is not possible, to an equivalent or similar job, and to retain rights already acquired or in the process of being acquired at the start of his parental leave, at the end of that leave.

          It follows that, according to the Court’s case-law, where they are unable to interpret and apply national law in compliance with the requirements of EU law, it is for the national courts and administrative bodies to apply EU law in its entirety and to protect rights which the latter confers on individuals, disapplying, if necessary, any contrary provision of domestic law (judgment of 25 November 2010, Fuß,

It would, furthermore, and more fundamentally, have the effect of giving such an appointment a random nature, since it would then depend on the results of that selection procedure.</p>

          In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the fourth and fifth questions is that it is for the referring court, if necessary by disapplying the rules of national law at issue in the main proceedings, to ascertain, as required by Clause 5(1) of the revised Framework Agreement, whether, in circumstances such as those of the main proceedings, it was not objectively possible for the

          concerned, in its capacity as an employer, to enable the person concerned to return to her post at the end of her parental leave and, if so, to ensure that she is assigned to an equivalent or similar post consistent with her employment contract or relationship, without that assignment of a post being made conditional upon holding a new selection procedure beforehand. It is also for that court to ensure that the person concerned may, at the end of parental leave, continue, in the post thus returned to or newly assigned, a probationary period under conditions that are in compliance with the requirements of Clause 5(2) of the revised Framework Agreement.
