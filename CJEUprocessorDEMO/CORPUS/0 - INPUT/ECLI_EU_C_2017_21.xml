          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1994:001:TOC" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab">OJ 1994 L 1, p. 3</a>
          ) by participating in two separate infringements, each constituting a single and continuous infringement. Those infringements related, first, to the colour cathode ray tubes for computer monitors market and, secondly, to the CPT market (‘the CPT cartel’). Toshiba’s action before the General Court related only to the CPT cartel. According to the decision at issue, the CPT cartel occurred between 3 December 1997 and 15 November 2006.

Secondly, the Commission stated that, as from 1 April 2003, the joint venture, over which MEI and Toshiba had exercised decisive influence, had continued its participation in the CPT cartel uninterruptedly. Consequently, the Commission concluded that Toshiba was liable, first, for the infringement committed directly by it, before the creation of the joint venture, and, secondly, jointly and severally with Panasonic for the infringement committed by the joint venture from the time at which that undertaking was set up.</p>

          ; ‘the Consolidated Jurisdictional Notice’), to which the General Court referred in paragraph 111 of the judgment under appeal, does not indicate that the holding of a veto right over a business plan is sufficient to justify such a conclusion, but merely that it may be sufficient in that regard. In addition, Toshiba argues that, in accordance with the General Court’s case-law, approval rights over the budget and business plan of a joint venture are not sufficient to prove the exercise of decisive influence, and it is necessary, in that respect, to assess also whether the parent companies of a joint subsidiary influenced the latter’s operational management.

        <p class="normal">In the second place, Toshiba contests the inferences that the General Court drew from Article 21.2 and Article 23.2 of the agreement creating the joint venture (‘the BIA’), according to which certain decisions taken by the joint venture required the approval of both parent companies and others required the consent of at least one director appointed by each of the parent companies. Toshiba submits, first of all, that, in paragraph 108 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court took account of its veto right on material investments, without examining, as required by paragraph 71 of the Consolidated Jurisdictional Notice, whether the investments constituted an essential feature of the relevant market. Next, according to Toshiba, the abovementioned provisions show, at most, that it was in a position to exercise decisive influence over the joint venture, but not that it actually exercised such influence, as the General Court wrongly concluded, in paragraph 112 of the judgment under appeal. Lastly, the rights mentioned in Article 21.2 of the BIA concern the protection of minority shareholders, as acknowledged in paragraph 66 of the Consolidated Jurisdictional Notice, and cannot be regarded as constituting indications of Toshiba’s capacity to exercise decisive influence over that undertaking, contrary to what the General Court held in paragraph 113 of the judgment under appeal.</p>

It merely made the adoption of the measures envisaged in that provision subject to the affirmative vote of one of the directors appointed by Toshiba, which could not control how those directors might vote and did not have the right to dismiss them.</p>

Toshiba argues that, contrary to what the General Court held in paragraph 116 of the judgment under appeal, the vice-president of the joint venture was not in a position to cause the joint venture’s commercial policy and Toshiba’s interests to converge, since it was the president of the joint venture, appointed by Panasonic, who was responsible for the operational management of that undertaking.</p>

          It must be borne in mind that, in an appeal, the Court of Justice has no jurisdiction to establish the facts or, in principle, to examine the evidence which the General Court accepted in support of those facts. Provided that the evidence has been properly obtained and the general principles of law and the Rules of Procedure in relation to the burden of proof and the taking of evidence have been observed, it is for the General Court alone to assess the value which should be attached to the evidence produced to it. Save where the evidence adduced before the General Court has been distorted, that assessment therefore does not constitute a point of law which is subject to review by the Court of Justice. However, the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice to review the findings of fact by the General Court extends, inter alia, to the question whether the rules relating to the burden of proof and the taking of evidence have been observed (judgment of 19 December 2013, Siemens and Others v Commission,

          Secondly, as can be seen from paragraphs 25 and 34 of the present judgment, Toshiba submits, inter alia, that the General Court failed to state reasons, or failed to state adequate reasons, for the judgment under appeal.

          Thirdly, as noted in paragraph 32 of the present judgment, Toshiba argues, inter alia, that the General Court substituted its own reasoning for that of the decision at issue.

          It should be pointed out that, according to settled case-law, liability for the conduct of a subsidiary can be imputed to its parent company in particular where, although it has separate legal personality, that subsidiary does not decide independently on its own conduct on the market, but carries out, in all material respects, the instructions given to it by the parent company, having regard in particular to the economic, organisational and legal links between those two legal entities (judgment of 16 June 2016, Evonik Degussa and AlzChem v Commission,

          In examining whether the parent company is able to exercise decisive influence over the market conduct of its subsidiary, account must be taken of all the relevant factors relating to the economic, organisational and legal links which tie the subsidiary to its parent company and, therefore, account must be taken of the economic reality (judgment of 24 June 2015, Fresh Del Monte Produce v Commission and Commission v Fresh Del Monte Produce,

          Moreover, the exercise of decisive influence by a parent company over its subsidiary’s conduct may be inferred from a body of consistent evidence, even if some of that evidence, taken in isolation, is insufficient to establish the existence of such influence (judgment of 24 June 2015, Fresh Del Monte Produce v Commission and Commission v Fresh Del Monte Produce,

          Lastly, the Court has previously held that the exercise of joint control, by two parent companies which are independent of each other, of their subsidiary does not, in principle, preclude a finding by the Commission of the existence of an economic unit comprising one of those parent companies and the subsidiary concerned (judgment of 24 June 2015, Fresh Del Monte Produce v Commission and Commission v Fresh Del Monte Produce,

That submission, even if it is correct, does not show that the General Court made a manifestly erroneous interpretation of any evidence before it, since the General Court never stated that that use had lasted for more than one year. That circumstance is capable, at most, of calling into question the substance of the factual findings that the General Court made on the basis of its interpretation, in itself correct, of the evidence in question.

        <p class="normal">Toshiba’s argument, according to which the General Court substituted its own assessment for that of the Commission, when it considered that the vice-presidents of the joint venture were in a position to cause the joint venture’s commercial policy and Toshiba’s interests to converge, must also be rejected. It is apparent from paragraph 116 of the judgment under appeal that, like the Commission, the General Court took the view that the fact that, in accordance with the BIA, Toshiba was to appoint one of the two directors entitled to represent the joint venture, who was also the vice-president of the joint venture, was an indication of Toshiba’s capacity to exercise decisive influence over the joint venture’s conduct. The reference to the thorough knowledge, on the part of the vice-presidents of the joint venture, of Toshiba’s policy and commercial objectives serves as grounds for that statement.</p>

          It must also be emphasised that, contrary to Toshiba’s assertions, it cannot be excluded that the fact that a parent company and its subsidiary have a preferential supplier relationship constitutes an indication of the former’s capacity to exercise decisive influence over the latter’s conduct (see, by analogy, judgment of 24 June 2015, Fresh Del Monte Produce v Commission and Commission v Fresh Del Monte Produce,

          ), since the question of the weight to be attached to such an indication in assessing whether the parent company and its subsidiary form a single economic unit ultimately comes within the scope of the General Court’s assessment of the facts, which cannot be called into question at the appeal stage.

        <p class="normal">Finally, the General Court did not err in taking the view, in essence, in paragraph 120 of the judgment under appeal, that the mere fact that the closure of two subsidiaries of the joint venture required Toshiba’s consent, which was given by the latter, constitutes an indication that Toshiba was able to exercise decisive influence over the joint venture, irrespective of the reasons for that consent. Since that conclusion cannot be called into question by either the assessment of those reasons or by Toshiba’s assertion, referred to in paragraph 34 of the present judgment, that the requirement for that consent related to the protection of minority shareholders, the allegation that the General Court failed to state reasons, or failed to state adequate reasons, for the judgment under appeal, because it did not specifically assess Toshiba’s line of argument with regard to those questions, cannot succeed.</p>

In that respect, it follows from the case-law cited in paragraph 47 of the present judgment that such an assessment may be inferred from a body of consistent evidence.</p>
