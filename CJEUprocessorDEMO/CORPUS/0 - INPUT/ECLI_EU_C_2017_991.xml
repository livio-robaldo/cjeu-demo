                The concept of quality wines in the Union is based, inter alia, on the specific characteristics attributable to the wine’s geographical origin. Such wines are identified for consumers through [PDOs] and [PGIs]. In order to allow for a transparent and more elaborate framework underpinning the claim by the products concerned to be of quality, a system should be established in which applications for a designation of origin or a geographical indication are examined in line with the approach followed by Union’s horizontal quality policy applicable to foodstuffs other than wine and spirits, set out in Regulation (EU) No 1151/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council [of 21 November 2012 on quality schemes for agricultural products and foodstuffs (

Thus, under Article 118k(1) of Regulation No 1234/2007 and Article 101(1) of Regulation No 1308/2013, names which have become generic are not protected as PDOs.

To take the view that the fact that the name of a foodstuff, such as ‘Champagner Sorbet’, is the name commonly used by the relevant public to refer to that foodstuff may be relevant when determining whether the use of a PDO as part of that name is unfair would be tantamount to accepting that that PDO may be used generically and would therefore be at odds with the protection conferred by those regulations.</p>

Thus, it is possible, under those provisions, to prohibit both false or misleading indications as to the geographical origin of the product concerned and false or misleading indications relating to the nature or essential qualities of the product, such as, for instance, its taste.</p>
