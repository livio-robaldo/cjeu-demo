          The Tribunale di Genova (District Court, Genoa, Italy) had asked the Court of Justice to rule on the question whether the prohibition on converting successive fixed-term contracts concluded with the public authorities into an employment contract of indefinite duration was compatible with EU law. In the judgment of 7 September 2006, Marrosu and Sardino (

          ), the Court replied to that question that such a prohibition is not incompatible with the clauses of the Framework Agreement, as long as the national legal order of the Member State concerned provides for the application of ‘another effective measure to prevent and, where relevant, punish the abuse of successive fixed-term contracts by a public sector employer’.

          Following that judgment, the Tribunale di Genova (District Court, Genoa) granted the workers affected not only compensation representing a minimum of five monthly salary payments but also ‘reinstatement compensation’ amounting to 15 times the last actual overall monthly salary payment of those workers. That decision was expressly upheld by the Corte d’appello di Genova (Court of Appeal, Genoa, Italy), which found that it constituted a response to the need to strengthen the protection of public sector workers, in accordance with the judgment of 7 September 2006, Marrosu and Sardino (

The loss of opportunity stems from the fact that fixed-term employment may have made ‘the worker lose other stable employment opportunities’. That court considered that the measure adopted by the Tribunale di Genova (District Court, Genoa) was inappropriate on the ground that a person who concludes a contract with a public authority is not liable to lose a job which can be obtained only following success in a recruitment competition.</p>

The referring court therefore wonders whether the former must benefit from a measure no less favourable than that from which the latter benefit, namely, compensation for the lack of conversion of the fixed-term employment relationship into an employment relationship of indefinite duration.

          It follows that clause 5(1) of the Framework Agreement requires Member States, in order to prevent the misuse of successive fixed-term employment contracts or relationships, to adopt one or more of the measures listed in that provision, where their domestic law does not include equivalent legal measures. The measures listed in clause 5(1)(a) to (c), of which there are three, relate, respectively, to objective reasons justifying the renewal of such contracts or relationships, the maximum total duration of successive fixed-term employment contracts or relationships, and the number of renewals of such contracts or relationships (judgment of 26 November 2014, Mascolo and Others,

          Furthermore, where, as in the present instance, EU law does not lay down any specific penalties in the event that instances of abuse are nevertheless established, it is incumbent on the national authorities to adopt measures that are not only proportionate, but also sufficiently effective and a sufficient deterrent to ensure that the provisions adopted pursuant to the Framework Agreement are fully effective (judgment of 26 November 2014, Mascolo and Others,

          While, in the absence of relevant EU rules, the detailed rules for implementing such provisions are a matter for the domestic legal order of the Member States, under the principle of their procedural autonomy, they must not, however, be less favourable than those governing similar domestic situations (principle of equivalence) or render impossible in practice or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by EU law (principle of effectiveness) (judgment of 26 November 2014, Mascolo and Others,

In that regard, Article 32(5) of Law No 183/2010 provides that, in the event of misuse of fixed-term employment contracts, the court is to order the employer to pay the worker concerned overall compensation of between 2.5 and 12 times his last actual overall monthly salary.</p>

It is impossible, in its view, to prove the loss of the opportunity to pass an administrative competition. Accordingly, the possibility for the worker concerned to demonstrate the existence of harm resulting from such a loss of opportunity is purely theoretical. Thus, it cannot, according to the referring court, be precluded that the provisions of national law governing the assessment of harm may render it practically impossible or excessively difficult for that worker to exercise the rights conferred on him by EU law, and in particular his right to compensation for the harm that he has suffered as a result of the misuse by his former public employer of successive fixed-term employment contracts.</p>

          Second, as regards the principle of effectiveness, it is clear from the case-law of the Court that the question as to whether a national procedural provision makes the exercise of rights conferred on individuals by EU law practically impossible or excessively difficult must be analysed by reference to the role of that provision in the procedure, viewed as a whole, and to the conduct and special features of that procedure before the various national bodies. In that context, it is necessary to take into consideration, where relevant, the principles which lie at the basis of the national legal system, such as the protection of the rights of the defence, the principle of legal certainty and the proper conduct of the proceedings (judgments of 21 February 2008, Tele2 Telecommunication,

In that context, it is necessary to take account of all the provisions laid down by the national legislature, including, in accordance with the case-law cited in paragraph 34 of this judgment, penalty mechanisms.

Such an infringement would also be taken into account for the purpose of assessing the work of those managers, who could, due to that breach, not be awarded a performance bonus. In addition, Article 36(6) of that legislative decree provides that public authorities which have acted in breach of the provisions concerning recruitment or employment cannot proceed with recruitments, for any reason whatsoever, during the three years following that breach.</p>
