It disputes the allegation that the contested decision amended a number of legislative acts of EU law and should thus be classified as a legislative act on account of its content.

An extension by up to 12 months in the specific context of the suspension mechanism provided for in Article 4(5) of the contested decision is no longer possible. It submits that the duration of the effects which the contested decision may have with regard to persons who have been relocated is irrelevant for the purpose of determining whether the decision is provisional. The question of the provisional nature of the contested decision must be assessed by reference to the temporal application of the relocation mechanism for which it provides, namely a period of 24 months.</p>

          Article 293 TFEU attaches to the Commission’s power of initiative –– in this case the power conferred by Article 78(3) TFEU in the framework of a non-legislative procedure –– a twofold safeguard. On the one hand, Article 293(1) TFEU provides that where, pursuant to the Treaties, the Council acts on a proposal from the Commission, it may amend that proposal only by acting unanimously, except in the cases referred to in the provisions of the FEU Treaty which are mentioned in Article 293(1) and which are of no relevance in the present case. On the other hand, Article 293(2) TFEU states that, as long as the Council has not acted, the Commission may alter its proposal at any time during the procedures leading to the adoption of an EU act (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 April 2015, Council v Commission,

          As a preliminary point, it must be recalled that, according to settled case-law of the Court, the principle of proportionality requires that acts of the EU institutions be appropriate for attaining the legitimate objectives pursued by the legislation at issue and do not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives; when there is a choice between several appropriate measures, recourse must be had to the least onerous, and the disadvantages caused must not be disproportionate to the aims pursued (see, inter alia, judgment of 4 May 2016, Poland v Parliament and Council,

          With regard to judicial review of compliance with that principle, it should also be borne in mind, as has already been stated in paragraph 124 of the present judgment, that the EU institutions must be allowed broad discretion when they adopt measures in areas which entail choices on their part, including of a political nature, and in which they are called upon to undertake complex assessments. Consequently, the legality of a measure adopted in one of those areas can be affected only if the measure is manifestly inappropriate having regard to the objective which those institutions are seeking to pursue (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 May 2016, Poland v Parliament and Council,

Moreover, the relocation mechanism is one of a broad range of financial and operational measures to support the asylum systems of the Hellenic Republic and the Italian Republic.

          First, the Slovak Republic submits that recourse could have been had to the mechanism provided for by Council Directive 2001/55/EC of 20 July 2001 on minimum standards for giving temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons and on measures promoting a balance of efforts between Member States in receiving such persons and bearing the consequences thereof (

        <p class="normal">It argues that the purpose of Directive 2001/55 is in essence to respond to the same situations of massive inflows of migrants as the contested decision by laying down a procedure for relocating persons qualifying for temporary protection. However, that directive is less harmful to the sovereign right of each Member State to decide freely on the admission of nationals of third countries to its territory, above all because it permits the Member States to decide themselves, in view of their reception capacity, how many persons are to be relocated to their territory. In addition, the status of temporary protection confers fewer rights than the status of international protection that the contested decision seeks to afford, in particular as regards the period of protection, and thus imposes significantly fewer burdens on the Member State of relocation.</p>

          Secondly, the Slovak Republic submits that the Hellenic Republic and the Italian Republic could have triggered what is known as the ‘EU civil protection’ mechanism provided for in Article 8a of Council Regulation (EC) No 2007/2004 of 26 October 2004 establishing a European Agency for the Management of Operational Cooperation at the External Borders of the Member States of the European Union (

That decision is therefore less prejudicial to their sovereignty. Since the contested decision was adopted only eight days after Decision 2015/1523 providing for the relocation of 40000 persons, it was impossible to conclude in such a brief period that Decision 2015/1523 was not appropriate for the purpose of responding to the situation obtaining at that time. Indeed, at the time of the adoption of the contested decision, nothing gave the Council grounds for considering that the reception measures provided for in Decision 2015/1523 would quickly become insufficient and that additional measures would be necessary.</p>

Before examining those arguments, it is necessary to recall the particularly sensitive context in which the contested decision was adopted, namely the acute emergency in Greece and Italy at that time, which was characterised by a sudden massive inflow of nationals of third countries in July and August 2015.</p>

Consequently, since, in its view, Hungary thus continued even after the contested decision was adopted to be confronted with an emergency situation, the decision to include it among the Member States of relocation and, for that purpose, to impose additional burdens on it in the form of relocation quotas was contrary to the objective of Article 78(3) TFEU of supporting Member States in such a situation.</p>
