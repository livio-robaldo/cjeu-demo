          By the decision at issue, the Commission found that there had been an infringement of Article 101(1) TFEU and Article 53 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area of 2 May 1992 (
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1994:001:TOC" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab">OJ 1994 L 1, p. 3</a>
          ), in the bathroom fittings and fixtures sector. That infringement, in which 17 undertakings had allegedly participated, was said to have taken place over various periods between 16 October 1992 and 9 November 2004 and to have taken the form of anticompetitive agreements or concerted practices covering Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria.

        <p class="normal">In the decision at issue, the Commission found that the infringement identified consisted in (i) the coordination, by the bathroom fittings and fixtures manufacturers, of annual price increases and other pricing elements within the framework of regular meetings of national industry associations; (ii) the fixing or coordination of prices on the occasion of particular events such as increases in raw material costs, the introduction of the euro and the establishment of road tolls in Germany; and, (iii) the disclosure and exchange of sensitive business information. Those practices had followed a recurring pattern which was consistent in each of the six Member States covered by the Commission’s investigation. Price setting in the bathroom fittings and fixtures industry followed an annual cycle, more specifically, the manufacturers set price lists, which generally remained in force for a year and formed the basis for commercial relations with wholesalers.</p>

        <p class="normal">The Commission also found that the practices described above formed part of an overall plan to restrict competition among the addressees of the decision at issue and had the characteristics of a single and continuous infringement, which covered three product subgroups — taps and fittings, shower enclosures and accessories and ceramics (‘the three product subgroups’) — and extended to the territory of Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria. As regards the organisation of the cartel, the Commission pointed to the existence of national industry associations with members active in all three product subgroups, which it termed ‘umbrella associations’, national industry associations with members active in at least two of the three product subgroups, which it termed ‘cross-product associations’, as well as product-specific associations with members active in only one of the three product subgroups. Lastly, it found that a central group of undertakings participated in the cartel in several Member States and in umbrella associations and cross-product associations.</p>

        <p class="normal">As regards the appellants’ participation in the infringement identified, first, the Commission noted that, despite being primarily ceramics manufacturers throughout the period of the infringement, they had nevertheless been aware of the various product ranges involved in the infringement, because of their participation in cartel meetings of the umbrella association in Germany, IndustrieForum Sanitär, formerly Freundeskreis der deutschen Sanitärindustrie (‘the IFS’), which covered the three product subgroups. Second, as regards the geographic scope of the cartel, the Commission considered that, during the periods of their participation in it, the appellants, as members of the IFS, of the Fachverband Sanitärkeramische Industrie, the coordination body of the product-specific association in the ceramics product subgroup in Germany (‘the FSKI’), of the Vitreous China-group, the product-specific association in the ceramics product subgroup in Belgium (‘the VCG’), and of the Association française des industries de céramique sanitaire, the product-specific association in the ceramics product subgroup in France (‘the AFICS’), had directly participated in Belgium, Germany and France in the infringement found. The Commission found that there was objective evidence that the appellants could reasonably have foreseen that the geographic scope of the infringement identified extended not only to Belgium, Germany and France, but also to Italy and Austria. As regards the Netherlands, the Commission stated that it did not conclude that a cartel had existed in the Netherlands after 1999.</p>

          For the purposes of setting the fine imposed on each undertaking, the Commission took as its basis the Guidelines on the method of setting fines imposed pursuant to Article 23(2)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 (
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:C:2006:210:TOC" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab">OJ 2006 C 210, p. 2</a>
          ; ‘the 2006 Guidelines’). It determined the basic amount of the fine, explaining that this calculation was based, for each undertaking, on its sales by Member State concerned, multiplied by the number of years of participation in the infringement found in the Member State in question for the relevant product subgroup, so that account was taken of the fact that certain undertakings were active only in certain Member States or in only one of the three product subgroups.

In addition, the Commission set the multiplier to be applied, to take account of the duration of the infringement, to the basic amount determined for the appellants, at 4.33 for Germany, at 3 for Belgium and at 0.66 for France. Finally, in order to deter the undertakings at issue from participating in the collusive practices with which the decision at issue was concerned, the Commission decided to increase the basic amount of the fine by an additional amount set at 15%.</p>

          They are of the view that the General Court merely checked whether they had complained that the Commission had made an error of assessment. It follows from several paragraphs of the judgment under appeal that the General Court was willing to review the decision at issue from a legal and substantive standpoint only in so far as specific complaints were made and as in so far as it was proved, at the same time, that the findings in that decision were false. In the absence of such proof, the General Court found that the findings of the Commission at issue had not been called into question even though they were expressly challenged. Thus, the General Court based its decision on a presumption that the Commission’s findings of fact were correct and its arguments well founded. The General Court did not carry out a review of all the elements of the decision at issue and waived its right to substitute its own appraisal for that of the Commission. As regards the legal findings, in accordance with the principle
          <span class="italic">iura novit curia</span>
          , the General Court was required to carry out the legal classifications itself and not simply to check whether the Commission had made errors in that regard.

          According to settled case-law, the review of legality provided for in Article 263 TFEU entails the EU judicature conducting a review, in respect of both the law and the facts, of the contested decision in the light of the arguments relied on by the applicant, which means that it has the power to assess the evidence, annul the decision and alter the amount of the fine (see judgment of 10 July 2014, Telefónica and Telefónica de España v Commission ,

          The review of legality is supplemented by the unlimited jurisdiction conferred on the EU judicature by Article 31 of Regulation No 1/2003, in accordance with Article 261 TFEU. That jurisdiction empowers the competent Court, in addition to carrying out a mere review of legality with regard to the penalty, to substitute its own appraisal for the Commission’s and, consequently, to cancel, reduce or increase the fine or penalty payment imposed (see judgment of 8 December 2011, Chalkor v Commission ,

However, by failing to examine all the stages of the calculation, by failing to state reasons for the outcome of that examination and by failing to examine either the proportionality of the fine or its compatibility with the principle of equal treatment, through a comparison with the fines imposed in parallel proceedings, the General Court failed to fulfil its obligation to exercise its powers of unlimited jurisdiction and its obligation to state reasons.</p>

The General Court concluded that, since the single and continuous infringement, which was committed for several years on the territories of the three Member States concerned and which consisted in cyclical price fixing, was among the most serious, a rate of 15% for the multiplier for ‘gravity of the infringement’ was to be regarded as an appropriate amount, in particular in view of the fact that the rates proposed for that type of infringement range from 0% to 30%.</p>

Second, the General Court, in paragraphs 261, 311 and 312 of that judgment, accorded a high level of probative value to the appellants’ participation in meetings which were not examined in the decision at issue. Third, in paragraphs 235, 239 and 298 of that judgment, the General Court, rejecting the appellants’ argument that the evidence failed to establish the existence of agreements concluded at the events concerned, held that an attempt to reach an agreement already constitutes an infringement of Article 101 TFEU. Thus, the General Court worked on the assumption that an ‘attempt to reach an agreement’ already constitutes a concerted practice and accepted that attempt as evidence against the appellants. The General Court therefore changed the Commission’s classification of the facts and exceeded the limits of the review of legality.</p>

The concepts of ‘agreement’ and ‘concerted practice’ are intended to catch forms of collusion having the same nature and are distinguishable from each other only by their intensity and the forms in which they manifest themselves. It is therefore sufficient, according to the Commission, to adduce evidence of either to establish an infringement of Article 101 TFEU. Finally, the allegedly unlawful reclassification of the decision at issue, which the General Court is claimed to have carried out in paragraphs 235, 239 and 298 of the judgment under appeal, is only a simple supposition on the part of the appellants.</p>

          Furthermore, the concepts of ‘agreement’ and ‘concerted practice’ within the meaning of Article 101(1) TFEU are intended, from a subjective point of view, to catch forms of collusion having the same nature which are distinguishable from each other only by their intensity and the forms in which they manifest themselves. It is therefore sufficient that proof of the constituent elements of either of those forms of infringement referred to in Article 101(1) TFEU has been established in order in any event for that provision to apply (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 December 2013, Solvay Solexis v Commission ,

        <p class="normal">Next, as regards the argument that the General Court accorded a high level of probative value, in paragraphs 261, 311 and 312 of the judgment under appeal, to certain evidence relating to the appellants’ participation in meetings which were not examined in the decision at issue, it should be noted that it is clear, on the one hand, from the wording of paragraphs 206 and 264 of the judgment under appeal, that the General Court was referring to the lists of meetings in Annexes 1 and 4 of the decision at issue, respectively, and, on the other hand, that paragraphs 261 and 311 of that judgment enumerate all the meetings contained in those lists. Although the General Court refers to the IFS meeting of 14 November 2001 and the FSKI meetings of 23 January and 5 July 2002, in paragraphs 264, 311 and 312 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court, contrary to what the appellants claim, did not examine those meetings and did not accord a high level of probative value to the evidence relating to them. Furthermore, although those meetings are referred to in the complete list of meetings, contained in paragraph 312 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court concluded, in paragraph 313 of that judgment, that almost all, and not all, the evidence supports the conclusion that the appellants participated in the single and continuous infringement at issue. It follows that the General Court did not in fact rely on the IFS meeting of 14 November 2001 and the FSKI meetings of 23 January and 5 July 2002 in concluding that the Commission had adduced proof of the appellants’ participation in the infringement in Germany during the period from 7 July 2000 to 9 November 2004.</p>

          Finally, as regards the appellants’ argument that the General Court erred in finding, in paragraphs 235, 239 and 298 of the judgment under appeal, that an attempt to reach an agreement already constitutes an infringement of Article 101 TFEU, it should be borne in mind that a ‘concerted practice’, within the meaning of Article 101(1) TFEU, refers to a form of coordination between undertakings which, without having been taken to a stage where an agreement properly so called has been concluded, knowingly substitutes for the risk of competition practical cooperation between them (see, to that effect, judgment of 8 July 1999, Commission v Anic Partecipazioni ,

          Accordingly, the criteria of coordination and cooperation which are constituent elements of a ‘concerted practice’ within the meaning of that provision must be understood in the light of the concept inherent in the provisions of the FEU Treaty relating to competition, to the effect that each economic operator must determine independently the policy which he intends to adopt on the internal market (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 October 2015, AC-Treuhand v Commission ,

          Furthermore, although that requirement of independence does not deprive economic operators of the right to adapt themselves intelligently to the existing and anticipated conduct of their competitors, it does however strictly preclude any direct or indirect contact between such operators, which is such as either to influence the conduct on the market of an actual or potential competitor or to disclose to such a competitor the course of conduct which the operator concerned himself has decided to adopt on the market or which he contemplates adopting, where the object or effect of such contact is to create conditions of competition which do not correspond to the normal conditions of the market in question, regard being had to the nature of the products or services offered, the size and number of the undertakings and the volume of the said market (see judgment of 8 July 1999, Commission v Anic Partecipazioni ,

Thirteenth, they submit that, in paragraph 321 of that judgment, the General Court distorted the appellants’ statement in point 110 of the application and point 43 of the reply, by holding, incorrectly, that the appellants had raised no argument relating to the VCG meeting on 30 October 2001. Fourteenth, it is alleged that, in paragraph 324 of that judgment, the General Court distorted recital 572 et seq. of the decision at issue in connection with the alleged accusation of price concertation in relation to 2005 within the AFICS.</p>

          In the first place, as regards the parts of the third ground of appeal relating to the measures of inquiry, it is settled case-law that it is for the EU judicature to decide, in the light of the circumstances of the case and in accordance with the provisions of the Rules of Procedure on measures of inquiry, whether it is necessary for a document to be produced. With regard to the General Court, it follows from Article 49 read in conjunction with Article 65(b) of its Rules of Procedure, in the version applicable when the judgment under appeal was delivered, that a request for production of any document relating to the case is a measure of inquiry which the General Court may order at any stage of the proceedings (see, to that effect, judgments of 2 October 2003, Salzgitter v Commission ,

          It is sufficient to point out that, since the appellants do not claim that the General Court failed to examine the pleas in law relied on at first instance, the question whether the General Court erroneously summarised the appellants’ arguments is irrelevant to the result of the present proceedings and, accordingly, the fifth and tenth parts of the third ground of appeal, in their entirety, and the first and ninth parts of that ground of appeal, in so far as they concern distortions of the appellants’ arguments, must be rejected (see, to that effect, judgment of 1 July 2010, Knauf Gips v Commission ,

        <p class="normal">In the third place, as regards the thirteenth part of the third ground of appeal, by which the appellants allege that the General Court erroneously concluded that they had raised no argument concerning the VCG meeting on 30 October 2001, it should be noted, first, that the General Court found, in paragraph 316 of the judgment under appeal, that the appellants did not deny that they had participated in the meetings of national industry associations in Belgium and France, but did dispute the nature of the conduct which took place at those meetings. Thus, the appellants submitted that, since the decisions within each undertaking were taken at the level of the parent company and their representatives at those meetings did not have any margin for negotiation, the exchanges of information on prices occurring on those occasions could not be equated to coordination of price increases and therefore had no anticompetitive object. Second, although the appellants, in point 110 of their application for annulment and in point 43 of their reply before the General Court, which have been invoked in support of the present appeal, formally disputed the existence of price concertation at the VCG meeting of 30 October 2001, it is essentially for the above-mentioned reasons. Those reasons were rejected, rightly, by the General Court in paragraph 318 of the judgment under appeal. In those circumstances, it should be considered that, despite the wording of paragraph 321 of the judgment under appeal which suggests that the appellants had not challenged the anticompetitive nature of the meeting of 30 October 2001, that wording is irrelevant to the outcome of the present case. Therefore, the thirteenth part of the third ground of appeal is unfounded.</p>

          In the fourth place, as regards the parts of the third ground of appeal relating to the distortion of evidence, it should be recalled that there is distortion where, without recourse to new evidence, the assessment of the existing evidence is manifestly incorrect. However, such distortion must be obvious from the documents on the Court’s file, without it being necessary to undertake a fresh assessment of the facts and the evidence. Moreover, where an appellant alleges distortion of the evidence by the General Court, he must indicate precisely the evidence alleged to have been distorted by that Court and show the errors of appraisal which, in his view, led to that distortion (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 December 2015, Italy v Commission ,

          ), which was raised also in the context of the seventh part of the third ground of appeal, it is settled case-law that the General Court’s obligation to state the reasons for its judgments does not in principle extend to requiring it to justify the approach taken in one case as against that taken in another case, even if the latter concerns the same decision (see judgment of 11 July 2013, Team Relocations and Others v Commission ,

Therefore, the fourteenth part of the third ground of appeal is unfounded.</p>

In that context, the General Court, moreover, took into account and used against the appellants in the judgment under appeal written arguments submitted out of time, relied upon by the Commission after the close of the written procedure, and did not give the appellants the opportunity to respond to the Commission’s allegations.</p>

Moreover, that part of the judgment under appeal is based entirely on a line of argument submitted out of time by the Commission, inasmuch as that line of argument was invoked, for the first time, more than a year and a half after the close of the written procedure.

          It is common ground that the right of access to the Commission’s file is designed to ensure effective exercise of the rights of the defence. Those rights are not only fundamental principles of EU law but are also enshrined in Article 6 of the ECHR. Moreover, failure to respect that right of access during the procedure prior to adoption of a contested decision can, in principle, cause the decision to be annulled if the rights of defence of the undertaking concerned have been infringed (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 October 2003, Corus UK v Commission ,

          Next, according to settled case-law, even where a request for the examination of witnesses, made in the application, states precisely about what facts and for what reasons the witness or witnesses should be examined, it falls to the General Court to assess the relevance of the request to the subject matter of the dispute and the need to examine the witnesses named (see judgment of 19 December 2013, Siemens and Others v Commission ,

          Finally, the General Court’s discretion in that regard is compatible with the fundamental right to a fair hearing and, in particular, Article 6(3)(d) of the ECHR. It is apparent from the Court’s case-law that that provision does not confer on the accused an absolute right to obtain the attendance of witnesses before a court and that it is in principle for the court to determine whether it is necessary or appropriate to call a witness. Article 6(3) of the ECHR does not require that every witness be called but is aimed at full equality of arms, ensuring that the procedure in issue, considered in its entirety, gave the accused an adequate and proper opportunity to challenge the suspicions concerning him (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 December 2013, Siemens and Others v Commission ,

The Commission adds that the participants have, in the present case, endorsed the uniform economic objective through their participation in the cartel meetings. In order to attribute to the appellants the unlawful conduct carried out by other undertakings, it is sufficient that the appellants were aware of that conduct or could reasonably have foreseen it. The General Court, on several occasions, examined the cartel meetings concerned and established that the relevant information had been communicated between the manufacturers of the three product subgroups, which is sufficient to establish the existence of ‘awareness or the presumption of awareness of the unlawful conduct’.</p>

          According to settled case-law, an infringement of Article 101(1) TFEU can result not only from an isolated act, but also from a series of acts or from continuous conduct, even if one or more aspects of that series of acts or continuous conduct could also, in themselves and taken in isolation, constitute an infringement of that provision.

          An undertaking may thus have participated directly in all the forms of anticompetitive conduct comprising the single and continuous infringement, in which case the Commission is entitled to attribute liability to it in relation to that conduct as a whole and, therefore, in relation to the infringement as a whole. Equally, the undertaking may have participated directly in only some of the forms of anticompetitive conduct comprising the single and continuous infringement, but have been aware of all the other unlawful conduct planned or put into effect by the other participants in the cartel in pursuit of the same objectives, or could reasonably have foreseen that conduct and have been prepared to take the risk.

          On the other hand, if an undertaking has directly taken part in one or more of the forms of anticompetitive conduct comprising a single and continuous infringement, but it has not been shown that that undertaking intended, through its own conduct, to contribute to all the common objectives pursued by the other participants in the cartel and that it was aware of all the other offending conduct planned or put into effect by those other participants in pursuit of the same objectives or that it could reasonably have foreseen all that conduct and was prepared to take the risk, the Commission is entitled to attribute to that undertaking liability only for the conduct in which it had participated directly and for the conduct planned or put into effect by the other participants, in pursuit of the same objectives as those pursued by the undertaking itself, where it has been shown that the undertaking was aware of that conduct or was able reasonably to foresee it and prepared to take the risk (see judgment of 24 June 2015, Fresh Del Monte Produce v Commission and Commission v Fresh Del Monte Produce ,

          In that regard, the Court of Justice has already held that the General Court is not required, for the purpose of characterising various instances of conduct as a single and continuous infringement, to establish whether they present a link of complementarity, in the sense that each of them is intended to deal with one or more consequences of the normal pattern of competition, and through interaction, contribute to the attainment of the set of anticompetitive effects desired by those responsible, within the framework of an overall plan having a single objective. By contrast, the condition relating to a ‘single objective’ requires that it be ascertained whether there are any elements characterising the various instances of conduct forming part of the infringement which are capable of indicating that the instances of conduct in fact implemented by other participating undertakings do not have an identical object or identical anticompetitive effect and, consequently, do not form part of an ‘overall plan’ as a result of their identical object distorting the normal pattern of competition within the internal market (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 December 2013, Siemens and Others v Commission ,

          Moreover, it cannot be inferred from the Court’s case-law that Article 101(1) TFEU concerns only either (i) the undertakings operating on the market affected by the restrictions of competition or indeed on the markets upstream or downstream of that market or neighbouring markets or (ii) undertakings which restrict their freedom of action on a particular market under an agreement or as a result of a concerted practice. Indeed, it follows from well-established case-law of the Court that the text of Article 101(1) TFEU refers generally to all agreements and concerted practices which, in either horizontal or vertical relationships, distort competition on the internal market, irrespective of the market on which the parties operate, and that only the commercial conduct of one of the parties need be affected by the terms of the arrangements in question (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 October 2015, AC-Treuhand v Commission,

        <p class="normal">The Commission contends that the existence of a competitive relationship was established for the cartel meetings at which the appellants were not the only ceramics manufacturers. According to the Commission, the pressure allegedly exerted by wholesalers did not deprive the appellants of their autonomy. Moreover, the appellants not only had the opportunity to respond to it individually, but also opted for a joint collusive practice and attempted to agree to a timetable for the introduction of price increases. The Commission indicates that, contrary to the arguments of the appellants, the exchange of information already infringes Article 101 TFEU where it underpins another anticompetitive arrangement.</p>

          First of all, it is clear from settled case-law that the exchange of sensitive information infringes Article 101(1) TFEU, in particular where it underpins another anticompetitive arrangement (see, to that effect, judgment of 7 January 2004, Aalborg Portland and Others v Commission ,

          Next, the exchange of commercial information between competitors in preparation for an anticompetitive agreement suffices to prove the existence of a concerted practice within the meaning of Article 101(1) TFEU. In that regard, it is not necessary to show that those competitors formally undertook to adopt a particular course of conduct or that the competitors colluded over their future conduct on the market (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 December 2013, Solvay v Commission ,
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2013%3A796&amp;locale=en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch" hreflang="en" class="CourtLink">C‑455/11 P</a>

          Finally, a party which tacitly approves of an unlawful initiative, without publicly distancing itself from its content or reporting it to the administrative authorities, effectively encourages the continuation of the infringement and compromises its discovery. That complicity constitutes a passive mode of participation in the infringement which is therefore capable of rendering the undertaking liable in the context of a single agreement. Nor is the fact that an undertaking does not act on the outcome of a meeting having an anticompetitive object such as to relieve it of responsibility for the fact of its participation in a cartel, unless it has publicly distanced itself from what was agreed in the meeting (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 June 2005, Dansk Rørindustri and Others v Commission ,
