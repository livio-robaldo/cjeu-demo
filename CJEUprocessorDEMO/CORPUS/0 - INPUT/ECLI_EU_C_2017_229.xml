Accordingly, except for those cases specified under the law, the authorities cannot take into consideration the individual and particular situation of the vehicle operator nor investigate whether or not the offence is actually attributable to that operator, that is to say, whether or not the commission of the offence was the result of express intention or mere negligence.</p>

However, such an adjustment, devoid of any connection with the conduct of the operator of the vehicle or its driver, fails to take account of the nature and gravity of the offence committed. As the European Commission notes in its written observations, the competent authority cannot, for example, take into account the distance travelled without the toll having been paid. The amount of the fine penalising the failure to comply with the payment obligation at issue in the main proceedings is therefore a flat rate and does not vary with either the kilometres travelled without authorisation or whether the offender did or did not pay a toll in advance for a specified itinerary.</p>

          With regard, firstly, to the compatibility of the institution of strict liability with the principle of proportionality, the Court has already ruled on a number of occasions that such a system penalising breaches of EU law is not in itself incompatible with that law (see, inter alia, judgment of 9 February 2012, Urbán,

          According to the Court, the imposition of a system of strict liability is not disproportionate in relation to the objectives pursued if that system is such as to encourage the persons concerned to comply with the provisions of a regulation and where the objective pursued is a matter of public interest which may justify the introduction of such a system (judgment of 9 February 2012, Urbán,

        <p class="normal">Next, it must be borne in mind that Directive 1999/62 requires the national legislatures to impose payment of a fee on heavy goods vehicles for the use of the road infrastructures. The national system at issue in the main proceedings, which transposes that directive, thus provides that the operators of those vehicles are required to pay a fee to use those infrastructures and institutes a penalty mechanism intended to ensure compliance with the payment obligation. Under the national legislation, there is an infringement of that obligation when the user of a tolled road infrastructure failed to pay, before using it, the required amount of the toll. Such a system of strict liability thus encourages the operators of heavy goods vehicles in circulation to make prior payment of the amount of the toll which they are due to pay.</p>

The Member States are, however, required to exercise that power in accordance with EU law and its general principles, and consequently in accordance with the principle of proportionality.

That driver therefore travelled approximately 5km on that motorway without having first paid the toll, the section in question being parallel to the lower category road. The amount due in respect of the 5km section travelled on the motorway was lower than that invoiced for use of the comparable section of the lower category road.

In that case, it is clear from the order for reference that that driver used a motorway in error for 20 minutes, because he had failed to take his intended exit.
