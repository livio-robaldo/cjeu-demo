          Secondly, under the second paragraph of Article 252 TFEU, it is the duty of the Advocate General, acting with complete impartiality and independence, to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases which, in accordance with the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, require the Advocate General’s involvement.

In contrast to the provision of that directive, the ‘repair’ clause, as set out in Directive 98/71, does not contain such a restriction. However, as noted in paragraph 37 of the present judgment, the amendment, during the legislative work that led to the adoption of Regulation No 6/2002, of the wording of the ‘repair’ clause contained in Article 110(1) of that regulation aimed to align that wording more closely with that of Article 14 of Directive 98/71.

        <p class="normal">As is apparent from that explanatory memorandum, the protection granted by Community designs may cause adverse effects by removing or restricting competition on markets, as regards, inter alia, long lasting and expensive complex products such as cars, in respect of which the protection of designs that are applied to the particular component parts which make up the complex product may create a veritable captive market for those spare parts. In that context, the purpose of the ‘repair’ clause is to avoid the creation of captive markets in certain spare parts and, in particular, to prevent a consumer who has bought a long lasting and perhaps expensive product from being indefinitely tied, for the purchase of external parts, to the manufacturer of the complex product.</p>

        <p class="normal">Audi submits, in that regard, that the application of the ‘repair’ clause is irreconcilable with the direct sale of replica parts to end consumers, so that manufacturers of replica parts must limit the distribution of their products to repair shops. Porsche contends that the manufacturer of replica parts must objectively ensure that his product can be purchased exclusively for repair purposes and not for other purposes as well, such as the customisation of the complex product. The Italian Government and the Commission maintain, in essence, that the manufacturer of replica parts is required to adopt general control measures intended to ensure the legal use of those parts. Acacia submits, for its part, that informing clients in advance and in writing regarding the fact that the component part is intended to permit the repair of a complex product so as to restore its original appearance is a measure compatible with the need to strike a fair balance of the interests at stake.</p>

The ‘use’ at issue covers, in that regard, in particular, as recalled in paragraph 68 of the present judgment, the making, offering, putting on the market, importing, exporting or using of a product in which the design is incorporated or to which it is applied, or stocking such a product for those purposes.</p>
