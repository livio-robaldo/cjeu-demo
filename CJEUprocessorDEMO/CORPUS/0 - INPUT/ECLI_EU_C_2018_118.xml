According to Western Sahara Campaign UK, the inclusion of that territory and those waters within their territorial scope is manifestly incompatible with international law and, more specifically, with the right to self-determination, Article 73 of the Charter of the United Nations, the provisions of the Convention on the Law of the Sea and the obligations incumbent on States and other subjects of international law to bring to an end serious breaches of a peremptory norm of international law, not to recognise an illegal situation resulting from such a breach, and not to provide assistance for the commission of an internationally wrongful act. Further, the Association Agreement, the Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the 2013 Protocol were not concluded on behalf of the people of Western Sahara nor in consultation with its representatives.

        <p class="normal">By means of its third question, the referring court raised with the Court, on the basis of a premiss analogous to that underlying its second question, the issue of the validity of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement and of the 2013 Protocol. In that regard, the referring court sought to ascertain, in essence, to what extent the European Union was entitled, having regard to Article 3(5) TEU, to conclude, with the Kingdom of Morocco, international agreements permitting the exploitation of the natural resources of the waters adjacent to the territory of Western Sahara. The referring court states that it is arguable that the conclusion of such international agreements is not generally and absolutely prohibited, notwithstanding, on the one hand, the fact that the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Morocco over Western Sahara is not recognised by the international community, and, on the other, the extended occupation of that non-self-governing territory by the Kingdom of Morocco. However, conclusion of those agreements, according to that court, is subject to the twofold requirement that they are in accordance with the wishes of the people of Western Sahara and are for their benefit. In this case, the referring court considers that it is for the Court to assess to what extent the Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the 2013 Protocol respect that twofold requirement.</p>

On that issue, the referring court stated that, if the disputes in the main proceedings had to be resolved in the light of domestic law alone, the actions would be dismissed, by reason of the fact that they require an assessment of the legality of the actions of a foreign sovereign. The referring court has also pointed out that the International Court of Justice, in its judgment of 15 June 1954, Case of the Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in 1943 (ICJ Reports 1954, p. 19), held that its Statute prohibited it from making findings that impugned the conduct of, or affected the rights of, a State that was not a party to the proceedings before it and that had not consented to be bound by its decisions. The referring court added, however, that since the subject matter of the disputes in the main proceedings was the validity of EU acts, if the Court were to declare that it had no jurisdiction, in a situation where there is serious doubt concerning the validity of the acts at issue, that might undermine the efficacy of Article 3(5) TEU.</p>

In that regard, let it suffice, however, to observe, without there being any need even to examine whether any joint intention of the parties to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement to give that expression a special meaning, in order to take such circumstances into account, would have been compatible with the rules of international law that are binding on the European Union, the existence of such a joint intention cannot, in any event, be identified in this case since the Kingdom of Morocco has categorically denied that it is an occupying power or an administrative power with respect to the territory of Western Sahara.</p>
