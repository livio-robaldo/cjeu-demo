They also refer to the judgment of 18 June 2015, Deutsche Bahn and Others v Commission (

          In proceedings under Article 101 TFEU, it is therefore appropriate to draw a distinction between two stages, that preceding the statement of objections and that following it (see, inter alia, judgment of 3 September 2009, Prym and Prym Consumer v Commission,

          As regards the judicial review of fines imposed by the Commission where competition law is infringed, it must be borne in mind that the Courts of the Union must carry out the review of legality on the basis of the evidence adduced by the applicant in support of the pleas in law put forward. In carrying out that review, the Courts cannot use the Commission’s margin of discretion — either as regards the choice of factors taken into account in the application of the criteria mentioned in the guidelines or as regards the assessment of those factors — as a basis for dispensing with an in-depth review of the law and of the facts (see, inter alia, judgment of 8 December 2011, Chalkor v Commission,

          The review of legality is supplemented by the unlimited jurisdiction conferred on the Courts of the Union by Article 31 of Regulation No 1/2003, in accordance with Article 261 TFEU. That jurisdiction empowers the Courts, beyond carrying out a mere review of legality with regard to the penalty, to substitute their own appraisal for the Commission’s and, consequently, to cancel, reduce or increase the fine or penalty payment imposed (see, inter alia, judgment of 8 December 2011, Chalkor v Commission,
