          As a preliminary point, it should be noted that the scheme for the taxation of the profit margin made by the taxable dealer on the supply of second-hand goods, such as those at issue in the main proceedings, constitutes a special arrangement for VAT, derogating from the general scheme of the VAT Directive.

          The Court has concluded from this, first of all, in the context of settled case-law on the right to deduct VAT laid down by the VAT Directive, that it is for the national authorities and courts to refuse the right of deduction if it is shown, in the light of objective evidence, that that right is being relied on for fraudulent or abusive ends. It has held, next, that the consequence of an abuse or fraud also applies, in principle, to the right to an exemption for intra-Community supplies (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 September 2012, Mecsek-Gabona,
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2012%3A547&amp;locale=en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch" hreflang="en" class="CourtLink">C‑273/11</a>

          ). Finally, the Court has held that, in so far as any refusal of a right under the VAT Directive reflects the general principle that no one may benefit from the rights stemming from the legal system of the European Union for abusive or fraudulent ends, such a refusal is incumbent, in general, on the national authorities and courts, irrespective of the VAT right affected by the fraud, including therefore the right to a VAT refund (see, to that effect, judgment of 18 December 2014, Schoenimport Italmoda Mariano Previti and Others,

          On the other hand, it is incompatible with the rules governing the right of deduction under the VAT Directive to impose a penalty, in the form of refusal of that right, on a taxable person who did not know, and could not have known, that the transaction concerned was connected with fraud committed by the supplier or that another transaction forming part of the chain of supply, downstream or upstream of the transaction carried out by the taxable person, was vitiated by VAT fraud.

          It follows that, even if all the substantive conditions giving rise to the right to the exemption of an intra-Community supply from VAT or to deduct VAT were not met, the Court has held that a taxable person who has acted in good faith and taken every step which could reasonably be required of him to satisfy himself that the transaction which he is effecting does not result in his participation in tax evasion cannot be refused that right (see, to that effect, judgments of 27 September 2007, Teleos and Others,

In such circumstances, it would be contrary to the principle of proportionality to require the taxable person to systematically verify, in respect of each supply, that the supplier actually applied the margin scheme, at least when there is no indication giving grounds for suspecting an infringement or fraud within the meaning of paragraph 39 of the present judgment.</p>

        <p class="normal">As to whether, in the main proceedings, there are indications giving grounds for suspecting an infringement or fraud, it should be noted that the Lithuanian Government acknowledged, at the hearing, in response to a question from the Court, that the mere reference to ‘Sections 69-71’ on the invoices received by Litdana is not, viewed in isolation, an indication that should have aroused its suspicions as to the existence of an infringement or fraud. In that government’s view, it is the fact that the invoices simultaneously include the references ‘Sections 69-71’ and ‘Free of VAT’ that is an indication of an infringement or fraud, within the meaning of paragraph 39 of the present judgment.</p>

        <p class="normal">While it is true that that double reference is not devoid of any ambiguity because it seems to refer both to the rules on taxing the supply on the basis of the dealer’s profit margin and to those exempting the supply from VAT, it should however be noted, as the European Commission has observed, that it is not obvious that that double reference is such as to arouse the suspicions of a prudent trader who is not a VAT expert as to the existence of an infringement or fraud committed by a trader at an earlier stage. It is not inconceivable that the taxable person may interpret the double reference as confirming that the supply was carried out, pursuant to Article 314(d) of the VAT Directive, by another taxable dealer, in so far as the supply by that other taxable dealer had been subject to VAT in accordance with the margin scheme. Both the reference to exemption from VAT and the reference to the margin scheme on the invoices at issue in the main proceedings could also be interpreted by the taxable person, as Litdana submitted at the hearing, as confirming that the dealer’s margin alone is being taxed, the value of the goods concerned remaining exempt, a matter which is for the referring court to ascertain.</p>

        <p class="normal">Moreover, and subject to verification by the referring court, the reference ‘Free of VAT’, combined with the details ‘Sections 69-71’ and ‘Total DKK incl. VAT’, on those invoices could also be interpreted by the taxable person as confirming that, when applying the margin scheme, he cannot, in accordance with Article 323 of the VAT Directive, deduct the input tax paid on the purchase of the goods at issue, or that the supplies are subject to the margin scheme under which, pursuant to Article 325 of that directive, the taxable dealer may not enter separately on the invoices which he issues the VAT relating to supplies.</p>
