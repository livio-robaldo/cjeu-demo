A selective application of the reduced rate of VAT to a single component of a single supply would nevertheless be subject to the condition that there should be no resulting distortion of competition between the suppliers of services or of the functioning of the VAT system. In concrete terms, it must be ensured that the price of that concrete and specific element of the supply can be determined and that that price reflects the actual value of that element, so as to exclude an artificial increase in the price allocated to that element.

          ), the Court held, in paragraph 29 of that judgment, that the essential features of the transaction concerned must be ascertained in order to determine whether the taxable person is supplying the customer, being a typical customer, with several distinct principal services or with one single service. According to the Court, such a method takes into account the fact, indeed recalled in paragraph 22 above, first, that it follows from Article 2(1) of the Sixth Directive that every supply of a service must normally be regarded as distinct and independent and, second, that a supply which comprises a single service from an economic point of view should not be artificially split, so as not to distort the functioning of the VAT system. Accordingly, paragraph 29 of that judgment cannot be interpreted as allowing the application of a separate rate of VAT to a concrete and specific element of a single supply. On the contrary, it follows from that paragraph that such an assessment would mean artificially splitting a single supply.

          <span class="italic">upplies of gas and electricity</span>
          set out in that directive, namely the fixed part of the prices of such supplies through public networks. Second, it is to be noted that, within the framework of proceedings for a declaration that a Member State had failed to fulfil its obligations, the Court found that the Commission had not adduced evidence that the application of that reduced rate to a single aspect of the supply of gas and electricity infringed the principle of fiscal neutrality inherent in the Sixth Directive, and did not address the issue of whether there was a single supply. Therefore, no conclusion can be drawn from that judgment regarding any possibility of applying a separate rate of VAT to separate elements of a single supply.

          ), that judgment concerns the compatibility, with Directive 2006/112, of national legislation providing for a selective application of the reduced rate of VAT by a Member State to the transportation of corpses by undertaker’s vehicles, separately from the other services provided by that firm and the supply of goods related thereto. In order to determine whether the selective application of a reduced rate of VAT complied with Articles 96 to 99(1) of Directive 2006/112, the Court held that the question whether a transaction including several elements must be considered to be a single supply was not decisive for the purpose of the exercise by the Member States of the discretion left to them by Directive 2006/112 as regards the application of the reduced rate of VAT (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 May 2010, Commission v France,

          ). Those were the circumstances in which the Court held that it was not necessary to examine whether or not the supply of services by undertakers was to be regarded as a single transaction, but that it was, however, necessary to ascertain whether the transportation of corpses by vehicles constituted a concrete and specific aspect of that category of supply, as set out in Annex III, point 16, to Directive 2006/112, and, if so, to examine whether or not the application of that rate undermines the principle of fiscal neutrality (judgment of 6 May 2010, Commission v France,
