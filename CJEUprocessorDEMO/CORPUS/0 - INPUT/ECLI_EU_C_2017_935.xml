To date, [the European Union] has not exercised its legislative competence in the areas of private law concerning contracts of carriage governed by those Appendices. Member States may therefore continue to exercise their competence in accordance with the second sentence of Article 2(2) [TFEU]. Moreover, in cases where competence is shared, Article 6(2) [of the accession agreement] explicitly provides that Member States may continue to vote independently in those areas. [The Federal Republic of Germany] hereby asserts, as a precaution, that it rejects any casting of its vote by the European Commission.’</p>

        <p class="normal">Recommended coordinated position:</p>
        <p class="normal">Amendments to Article 6 and new Article 6a concern Union law because of the use of the consignment note and its accompanying documents for customs and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) procedures. The Union agrees with the intention of OTIF to give priority to the electronic form of consignment notes. However, at present the adoption of these amendments may lead to unintended consequences. The current simplified procedure for customs transit by rail is only possible with paper documents. Therefore, if railways opt for the electronic consignment note, they will have to use the standard transit procedure and the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS).</p>
        <p class="normal">
          The Commission has started preparations for a working group to discuss the use of electronic transport documents for transit under Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council [of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code (
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2013:269:TOC" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab">OJ 2013 L 269, p. 1</a>
          )]. That working group will have its kick-off meeting on 4-5 June 2014. The Union agrees also with the intention to provide the accompanying documents in electronic format. However, under current Union law there is no legal basis to provide the documents (e.g. Common Veterinary Entry Document, Common Entry Document) which have to accompany SPS-related goods in electronic format and therefore they need to be provided on paper. The Commission has prepared a draft Regulation, which will cater for electronic certification and the draft is currently under discussion in the European Parliament and the Council. That Regulation (Official Control Regulation) is envisaged to be adopted by end of 2015/beginning of 2016, however, there will be a transitional period for the enforcement.
        </p>
        <p class="normal">Therefore, the Union suggests that no decision should be taken on these items at the present session of the [Revision Committee] and that OTIF continue cooperation with the Union on this issue in order to have a well‑prepared solution for an upcoming revision of CIM which should ideally be synchronised with the Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 and its implementing provisions which are to be in force from 1 May 2016. Certain electronic procedures may be phased in between 2016 and 2020 in accordance with Article 278 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013.</p>

          )]. However, the proposed amendment to Article 7 submitted by [the French Republic] concerning the liability of the person who has provided a vehicle for use as a means of transport in case of damage resulting from a defect of the vehicle needs further analysis within the Union before taking a decision in OTIF. Therefore, the Union is not in a position to support this amendment proposal at this [session of the OTIF Revision Committee] and proposes to postpone the decision until the next General Assembly in order to further assess this issue. The Union takes the same position, i.e. to postpone the decision until the next General Assembly in order to further assess the issue, on the proposal of [the Federal Republic of Germany] for a new Article 1a presented to OTIF during Union coordination.

In the latter case also, the Union has the competence to adopt a decision, under Article 218(9) TFEU, acting by virtue of a shared external competence, that competence being limited, in accordance with Protocol No (25) on the exercise of shared competences, annexed to the EU and FEU Treaties, to the specific elements governed by the Union decision in question.

          ). As is clear from paragraphs 51 and 52 of that judgment, the Court took into consideration the fact that the area of the Common Agricultural Policy and, more specifically, the common organisation of the wine markets, is one which is regulated for the most part by the EU legislature in the exercise of its competence under Article 43 TFEU, in order to determine whether the European Union could rely on Article 218(9) TFEU, although it was not a party to the international agreement at issue in the case that led to that judgment. That question does not, however, arise in the present case, given that the Union acceded to the COTIF with effect from 1 July 2011.

A clear demarcation of competences is particularly important in cases of mixed agreements, first, due to the fact that the provisions of such agreements are applicable both within EU law and within national law and, second, in order to determine the competences of the various participants within the bodies of international organisations. In this case, however, the Council has not cited any instrument of EU law in the area concerned and has referred only to instruments connected with public law, although the amendments at issue fall within the area of private law concerning contracts relating to transport.</p>

The work undertaken within that working group was continued on 5 and 16 June 2014, on the basis of a proposal for a decision that the Commission had meantime sent. That proposal, after it was approved on 17 June 2014 by the Permanent Representatives Committee, was adopted by the Council on 24 June 2014, that is, in good time, before the opening of the 25th session of the OTIF Revision Committee, on 25 June 2014.</p>

Further, the progress of the procedure, as described by the Council and summarised in paragraph 100 of the present judgment, indicates that the Council began preliminary discussions with a view to the adoption of a Union position without waiting for all the working documents drawn up for the 25th session of the OTIF Revision Committee to be sent to it. The four meetings of the appropriate Council working group and of the Permanent Representatives Committee were devoted to, inter alia, clarification of the allocation of the respective powers of the European Union and the Member States with respect to the items on the agenda of the 25th session of the OTIF Revision Committee, on the subject of which the Federal Republic of Germany had expressed its reservations. Last, the Federal Republic of Germany has not established that the period of one week that elapsed between the approval of the proposal for a decision by the Permanent Representatives Committee and the adoption of the contested decision by the Council was so unwarranted as to call into question the fulfilment, by that institution, of its duty of sincere cooperation with the Member States.</p>

It has to be said, however, that, in any event, that argument is based on a mistaken premiss. That Member State has not demonstrated that, during that session, the contested decision produced such effects, nor has it rebutted the arguments relied on in its defence by the Council on this subject, as summarised in paragraph 103 of the present judgment.
