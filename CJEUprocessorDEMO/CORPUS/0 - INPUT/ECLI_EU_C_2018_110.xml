In order to purchase shares in the latter, which were held by third parties, X BV set up another Italian company, to which it contributed capital in the amount of EUR 237312000. That contribution was financed by means of a loan to X BV from a Swedish company in the same group. Under that loan, in 2004 X BV owed the lending company the sum of EUR 6503261 in respect of interest. That interest was deducted by X BV in its corporation tax return for 2004. Nonetheless, the tax authorities considered that Article 10a(2)(b) of the Law on corporation tax precluded that deduction, and they issued a notice of assessment to X BV which the latter seeks to have annulled in the Netherlands courts.</p>

Such a scheme constitutes an advantage for the companies concerned in so far as it allows, in particular, for the profits and losses of the companies constituting the tax entity to be consolidated at the level of the parent company and for the transactions carried out within that tax entity to remain neutral for tax purposes.

        <p class="normal">In the present case, the difference in treatment at issue stems from the combination of Article 10a(2)(b) and Article 15 of the Law on corporation tax. However, the purpose of those provisions is different. Whereas Article 10a(2)(b) of that law seeks to prevent the Netherlands tax base being eroded by contrived intra-group financial arrangements, Article 15 of the law allows the profits and losses of the companies constituting the single tax entity to be consolidated at the level of the parent company and the transactions carried out within the group to remain neutral for tax purposes. According to the referring court, one of the consequences of the single tax entity scheme is that the association between the loan and the capital contribution which determines whether Article 10a(2)(b) of the Law on corporation tax applies disappears because of consolidation.</p>

          First, the Court must assess whether such a difference in treatment may be justified by the need to safeguard the allocation of the power to impose taxes between the Member States. The Court has held, in the judgment of 25 February 2010, X Holding (
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2010%3A89&amp;locale=en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch" hreflang="en" class="CourtLink">C‑337/08</a>

          ), as is apparent from paragraph 23 of the present judgment, that consolidation at the parent-company level for the profits and losses of the companies constituting a single tax entity represents an advantage which may justifiably be reserved to resident companies in view of the need to safeguard the allocation of the power to impose taxes between the Member States.

The main proceedings concern the possibility of deducting interest charges, not the general offsetting of costs and gains specific to a single tax entity. Far from reserving that possibility of deducting interest to single tax entities, Netherlands law affords that possibility to any company and restricts it only in the particular case and conditions laid down in Article 10a(2)(b) of the Law on corporation tax. In avoiding that restriction, a parent company which together with its subsidiary forms a single tax entity does not, therefore, obtain an advantage specifically linked to the tax scheme of the single tax entity.</p>

          Secondly, the referring court asks whether justification could be derived from the need to ensure the coherence of the Netherlands tax system. The Court accepts that such a justification constitutes an overriding reason in the public interest, provided that a direct link is established between the tax advantage concerned and the offsetting of that advantage by a particular tax levy, the direct nature of that link falling to be examined in the light of the objective pursued by the rules in question (judgment of 2 September 2015, Groupe Steria,

        <p class="normal">The disadvantage for a Netherlands company of not being able to deduct the currency loss it sustains, as the case may be, on its holding in a non-resident subsidiary is inseparable from the symmetrical advantage linked to the absence of taxation of currency gains. As the referring court states, ‘the holding exemption’ is a priori neither advantageous nor disadvantageous. It cannot, therefore, give rise to a difference in treatment unfavourable to Netherlands companies having a subsidiary in another Member State nor, therefore, constitute a restriction on freedom of establishment.</p>
