          The Supremo Tribunal de Justiça (Supreme Court) dismissed the appeal. In essence, it took the view that Mr Neto de Sousa’s entitlement to compensation was governed by both Article 495(3) and Article 483 of the Civil Code, that that right arose ‘in the legal sphere’ of the party claiming the compensation and not that of the deceased and that, by his culpable driving, Mr Neto de Sousa has infringed one of his own rights. That court held that, in accordance with the maxim
          <span class="italic">sibi imputet</span>
          , the right provided for in Article 495(3) of the Civil Code was not open to a person who is alone responsible for an accident which caused the death of his wife, a passenger in the vehicle which he was driving and that, in consequence, Mr Neto de Sousa was not entitled to compensation.
