The considerations which determine that choice cannot affect the admissibility of the action. The rules laid down in Article 258 TFEU must be applied without any obligation on the Commission to act within a specific period, subject to situations in which the excessive duration of the pre-litigation procedure is liable to make it more difficult for the Member State concerned to refute the Commission’s arguments and thus to infringe the rights of the defence.

Thus, the Grand-Ducal Regulation does not restrict the exemption from VAT to, solely, the services supplied by the IGP and directly necessary for the activities which are not liable to VAT or which are exempt undertaken by its members, contrary to Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112. Accordingly, in so far as those supplies of services do not satisfy the conditions set out in Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112, they ought to be taxed in accordance with Article 2(1) of that directive.</p>

According to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the fact, for the members of an IGP, of carrying out an activity which is exempt or in relation to which they are not taxable persons is a sufficient condition for the purposes of the application of the exemption set out in that provision.

          In this connection, it is clear from the settled case-law of the Court that the terms used to specify the exemptions from VAT set out in Article 132 of Directive 2006/112 must be interpreted strictly since those exemptions constitute exceptions to the general principle that all services supplied for consideration by a taxable person are subject to that tax. Nevertheless, the interpretation of those terms must be consistent with the objectives pursued by those exemptions and comply with the requirements of the principle of fiscal neutrality inherent in the common system of VAT. Accordingly, the requirement of strict interpretation does not mean that the terms used to specify the exemptions referred to in Article 132 should be construed in such a way as to deprive the exemptions of their intended effects. It is not the purpose of the case-law of the Court to impose an interpretation which would make the exemptions concerned almost inapplicable in practice (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 December 2008, Stichting Centraal Begeleidingsorgaan voor de Intercollegiale Toetsing,

          As regards the requirements relating to holding an invoice, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg states that the Court recognised, in its judgment of 21 April 2005, HE (

          ), the right of a taxable person who does not hold an invoice in his own name to deduct VAT. According to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the requirement to hold an invoice, to be satisfied by the taxable person claiming an exemption, is justified essentially by the low level of risk it is thereby possible to achieve as regards possible double deduction of VAT, fraud or abuse. In this connection, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg contends that, since IGPs are not entitled to deduct VAT, there is therefore no risk of double deduction of VAT.

It is clear from the very wording of that provision that the IGP is independent, and that it therefore carries out its supplies of services independently, within the meaning of Article 9 of Directive 2006/112. Furthermore, if the services supplied by the IGP were not services supplied by a taxable person acting as such, those services would not be subject to VAT, under Article 2(1)(c) of Directive 2006/112. Those services would therefore not be capable of forming the subject matter of an exemption, such as that set out in Article 132(1)(f) of that directive, as the Advocate General has observed in point 50 of her Opinion.</p>

          ), relied on by the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, in which the Court held, in essence, in paragraphs 24 to 26 and 29 of that judgment, that a taxable person who had set up a pension fund in the form of a legally and fiscally separate entity, in accordance with an obligation imposed on that taxable person as an employer by national legislation, was entitled to deduct the VAT he had paid on services relating to the management and operation of that fund. As is apparent from paragraph 25 of that judgment, the taxable person itself in that case had acquired the services in question subject to VAT, for the purpose of the administration of its employees’ pensions and the management of the assets of the pension fund set up to safeguard those pensions. It cannot therefore be inferred from that judgment that the members of an IGP are entitled to deduct the VAT on the goods and services acquired by the group, since only the latter may possibly claim a right of deduction of that VAT.

          Second, the line of argument of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg alleging a breach of the principle of fiscal neutrality must be rejected. In accordance with that principle, the deduction system is meant to relieve the trader entirely of the burden of the VAT payable or paid in the course of all his economic activities (judgment of 15 September 2016, Landkreis Potsdam-Mittelmark,

In this connection, it states that an IGP which does not have legal personality cannot act independently, but only through a member acting on its behalf, and that the transactions between an IGP and that member are not necessarily transactions between two separate taxable persons. In that context, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg draws a parallel with common funds, within the meaning of Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) (

          The Grand Duchy of Luxembourg submits that the relationship between the members of an IGP and the latter may, depending on the contractual stipulations of the IGP created, be analogous to that of the members of a consortium, such as found by the Court in the judgment of 29 April 2004, EDM (

However, as the Commission maintains, the passage in that note, namely ‘where a direct relationship between the group and the third parties may not be entered into for commercial or legal reasons’, seems to indicate that that is not the case. Nevertheless, and in any event, whether that passage applies to IGPs which have legal personality has no bearing on the analysis of the third ground for complaint.</p>

The argument of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg that the transactions between an IGP and one of its members are not necessarily transactions between two separate taxable persons, since the former may act only through one of its members, and the parallel drawn in that context with common funds, are therefore irrelevant to the present case.</p>

          Accordingly, that provision creates the legal fiction of two identical supplies of services provided consecutively. Under that fiction, the operator, who takes part in the supply of services and who constitutes the commission agent, is considered to have, firstly, received the services in question from the operator on behalf of whom it acts, who constitutes the principal, before providing, secondly, those services to the client himself (judgment of 14 July 2011, Henfling and Others,

          Since Article 28 of Directive 2006/112 comes under Title IV of that directive, entitled ‘Taxable transactions’, the two supplies of services concerned fall within the scope of VAT. It follows that, if the supply of services in which an operator takes part is subject to VAT, the legal relationship between that operator and the operator on behalf of whom it acts is also subject to VAT (see, by analogy, judgment of 14 July 2011, Henfling and Others,
