By its third ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court for having dismissed the plea of illegality raised against the 2002 Leniency Notice. By its fourth ground of appeal, it criticises the grounds of the judgment under appeal relating to the specific nature of the Italian market for taps and fittings and to the relevance of the evidence relied on by the Commission concerning the appellant’s participation in the infringement committed on that market. The fifth ground of appeal criticises the judgment under appeal for failing to penalise the errors made by the Commission in determining the fine to be imposed on the appellant. By its sixth ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the General Court for having held that the Commission had sufficiently reduced the fine imposed on it.

No directly applicable provision, adopted by the legislature of the European Union, which has competence in competition matters, confers on the Commission the power to refrain from penalising an undertaking which has infringed competition rules solely on the ground that that undertaking has declared that it committed the infringement.

Moreover, it is alleged that the General Court, in paragraphs 65 to 72 of the judgment under appeal, carried out a cursory examination of that argument, satisfying itself with various observations of principle, with the result that the reasoning of the judgment under appeal is deficient.</p>

In particular, the appellant claims that the General Court erred in finding that the appellant’s representative, Mr Costagli, was present at the meeting on 1 February 2001, although, in the appellant’s submission, it was shown that he did not attend that meeting. Moreover, it is alleged that the General Court, in paragraph 106 of the judgment under appeal, wrongly rejected the argument concerning the unreliability of the evidence obtained at the Euroitalia meetings, by holding that it was apparent from the typed notes of Grohe Beteiligungs GmbH that RAF Rubinetteria SpA had planned a price increase of 3%.</p>

          In that regard, it must be recalled that, according to well-established case-law, that obligation to state reasons does not however require the General Court to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one by one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case.

        <p class="normal">In that regard, the appellant submits, in particular, first, that, by reversing the burden of proof, application of the 2002 Leniency Notice resulted in an infringement of Article 2 of Regulation No 1/2003. Second, it claims that application of that notice infringes the right to a fair trial enshrined in Articles 6 and 7 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed at Rome on 4 November 1950 (‘the ECHR’) and Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Third, the appellant criticises the General Court for having merely noted, in paragraph 155 of the judgment under appeal, that a penalty is lawful where the person concerned is in a position to ascertain which acts and omissions render him liable, without responding to the complaint, raised at first instance, that the system of determining penalties applicable in competition matters is not compatible with the ECHR, in particular Article 7 thereof, which requires that infringements and punishments be clearly defined. Fourth, the appellant criticises the General Court for having held, in paragraph 169 of the judgment under appeal, that the appellant pleaded before the General Court that the Commission had made an error in the assessment of the facts only when setting the multiplier for the ‘additional amount’ at the rate of 15% and not when setting the multiplier for the ‘gravity of the infringement’ at the same rate. Fifth, the appellant pleads the illegality of the criteria set out in the 2006 Guidelines, the taking account of which by the Commission when determining the amount of each of the penalties results, because of the application of the ceiling provided for in Article 23(2) of Regulation No 1/2003, in the amount of the fine imposed automatically being 10% of turnover. The General Court completely failed to examine that plea of illegality and confined itself, in paragraph 158 of the judgment under appeal, to observing that the appellant had not been ordered to pay a penalty equal to 10% of turnover. Sixth, the Commission and then the General Court set the multipliers for the ‘gravity of the infringement’ and the ‘additional amount’ starting, as is clear from paragraphs 165 and 166 of the judgment under appeal, from the erroneous premisses that the appellant had participated in a single infringement, on the territories of six Member States, covering all the product groups under investigation, with a market share of approximately 54.3% in each of those States, and engaging in anticompetitive practices which were, as a rule, implemented. Seventh, the appellant submits that, although the General Court held that the Commission’s decision was vitiated by an error of assessment, it drew no conclusions from this in paragraphs 192 to 195 of the judgment under appeal. In proceeding in that way, the General Court infringed the principles of proportionality and equal treatment.</p>

Accordingly, as it confirmed at the hearing, the Commission, while considering that the General Court was correct in rejecting the appellant’s arguments concerning infringement of the principles of equal treatment and proportionality, requests the Court of Justice to replace the relevant grounds of the judgment under appeal, in so far as that part of the General Court’s reasoning is concerned.</p>

          In that regard, it should be pointed out, first, that the cartel in question, since its purpose was price coordination, falls within the category of infringements referred to in points 23 and 25 of the 2006 Guidelines, and is, on that basis, among the most harmful infringements. Second, as the General Court stated in paragraph 171 of the judgment under appeal, that rate is the lowest rate on the 15% to 25% scale of the value of sales, laid down for such infringements in point 25 of the 2006 Guidelines (see judgment of 11 July 2013, Ziegler v Commission,

          As regards the determination of the multiplier for the ‘additional amount’, it is apparent from point 25 of the 2006 Guidelines that account must be taken of a number of factors, in particular those identified in point 22 of those guidelines. Although, in assessing the gravity of an infringement and subsequently setting the fine to be imposed, account may be taken, inter alia, of the geographic extent of an infringement and of the number of product subgroups covered by it, the fact that an infringement covers a larger geographical area and a larger number of products by comparison with another does not, on its own, necessarily mean that the first infringement, considered as a whole, must be classified as more serious than the second and as therefore justifying the setting of a multiplier for the ‘additional amount’ which is higher than that used for calculating the fine imposed in relation to the second infringement (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 July 2014, Telefónica and Telefónica de España v Commission,

          Nonetheless, in so far as the appellant complains, in essence, that the Commission and then the General Court infringed the principle of equal treatment, first, in failing to make the fine imposed specific to the appellant by taking into account the gravity of the infringement relative to the appellant’s participation in it as compared with the participation of the other undertakings concerned and, second, in applying to the appellant, in paragraphs 192 to 195 of the judgment under appeal, the same multiplier for the ‘additional amount’ of 15% as applied to the undertakings which participated in the single infringement covering three product subgroups in six Member States, it must be recalled that the principle of equal treatment is a general principle of EU law, enshrined in Articles 20 and 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. According to settled case-law, that principle requires that comparable situations must not be treated differently and different situations must not be treated in the same way unless such treatment is objectively justified (see, inter alia, judgment of 12 November 2014, Guardian Industries and Guardian Europe v Commission,

          Observance of that principle is binding, in particular, on the General Court in the exercise of its unlimited jurisdiction. When the amount of the fines imposed is determined, the exercise of such jurisdiction cannot result in discrimination between undertakings which have participated in an agreement or concerted practice contrary to Article 101(1) TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 18 December 2014, Commission v Parker Hannifin Manufacturing and Parker-Hannifin,

          It follows from the case-law of the Court of Justice, however, that the taking into account of differences between the undertakings that have participated in a single cartel (in particular with regard to the geographic scope of their respective involvement) for the purpose of assessing the gravity of an infringement need not necessarily occur when the multipliers for the ‘gravity of the infringement’ and for the ‘additional amount’ are set but may occur at another stage in the setting of the fine, such as when the basic amount of the fine is adjusted in the light of mitigating and aggravating circumstances under points 28 and 29 of the 2006 Guidelines (see, to that effect, judgments of 11 July 2013, Team Relocations and Others v Commission,

          As the Commission has observed, such differences may also be reflected by means of the value of sales that is used in calculating the basic amount of the fine, inasmuch as that value reflects, for each participating undertaking, the scale of its involvement in the infringement in question, in accordance with point 13 of the 2006 Guidelines, under which it is possible to take as a starting point for the calculation of the fines an amount which reflects the economic significance of the infringement and the size of the undertaking’s contribution to it (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 July 2013, Team Relocations and Others v Commission,
