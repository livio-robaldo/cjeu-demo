In that regard, Article 68(13) of Legislative Decree No 163/2006, which transposes Article 34(8) of Directive 2004/17 into national law, is to be distinguished from the case in which the contracting authority defines the products which are the subject matter of the tender in accordance with Article 68(3) of that legislative decree, namely, where the tenderer is required to prove at the tendering stage that the solutions which it proposes satisfy in an equivalent manner the requirements defined by the technical specifications. In addition, that court points out that account should also be taken of the technical specifications in the contract documentation, which provide that, in the case of equivalent products, equivalence must be attested by an appropriate certificate from the manufacturer, to be presented to the contracting authority at ‘the time of the first delivery of an equivalent spare part’. However, a systematic interpretation of Article 34(8) of Directive 2004/17 could require proof of equivalence to be furnished at the time when a tender is submitted.</p>
