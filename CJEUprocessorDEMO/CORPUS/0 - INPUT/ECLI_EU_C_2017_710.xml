In the light of that case-law, the referring court seeks to ascertain, in essence, whether, if the application by Mr Beshkov is to be granted, the conviction before the Landesgericht Klagenfurt (Regional Court of Klagenfurt) must, first, be recognised in accordance with, in particular, Articles 463 to 466, or rather whether, as Mr Beshkov argues, the referring court can or must grant that application, without that conviction having been the subject of such prior recognition, on the basis of Article 8(2) of the Criminal Code, which transposes Framework Decision 2008/675 into Bulgarian law.</p>

In this case, since the sentence of 18 months imprisonment, a period of 12 months being suspended, imposed on Mr Beshkov by that court was higher than that imposed by the referring court in its judgment of 29 April 2013, the referring court was bound to apply to Mr Beshkov an overall sentence corresponding to that first sentence. However, in accordance with Article 66(1) of the Criminal Code, Mr Beshkov, who has, in the past, already been convicted on several occasions and sentenced to periods of imprisonment in Bulgaria, can no longer qualify for suspension of sentence in that Member State. Consequently, the referring court would have to alter the arrangements for enforcing the sentence imposed on Mr Beshkov by the Landesgericht Klagenfurt (Regional Court of Klagenfurt) and apply to him an overall sentence of 18 months imprisonment, while deducting the period of six months imprisonment already served in Austria.</p>

          Nonetheless, as stated in recital 2 of the Framework Decision, the aim of Framework Decision 2008/675 is to implement the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and judicial decisions in criminal matters, a principle enshrined in Article 82(1) TFEU, which replaced Article 31 EU, on the basis of which that Framework Decision was adopted. As the Advocate General stated in points 30, 31 and 64 of his Opinion, that principle precludes the possibility that it should be a prerequisite of account being taken, in the context of that Framework Decision, of a previous conviction handed down by a court of another Member State, that a national procedure for prior recognition, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, be implemented, and also the possibility of that previous conviction being, in that procedure, reviewed (see, by analogy, judgment of 9 June 2016, Balogh,
