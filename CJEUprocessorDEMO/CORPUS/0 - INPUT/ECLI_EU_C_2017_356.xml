It argues that, accordingly, the considerations of the General Court set out in paragraphs 74 and 75 of the judgment under appeal are incorrect in law and that, where a request for access relates to only two documents, there can be no interest of efficient administration capable of justifying the application of a general presumption of confidentiality.

The Commission’s definitive decision not to commence a formal infringement procedure against the Federal Republic of Germany was not taken until 27 September 2012, with the closure of the EU Pilot procedure at issue. In consequence, although the contested decision, dated 21 June 2012, was adopted after the letter of 30 April 2012, the fact remains that that decision was adopted before the rejection of the commencement of a formal infringement procedure on 27 September 2012.

          The Kingdom of Sweden, supported by the Republic of Finland, argues that the decision of the General Court in paragraphs 94 and 95 of the judgment under appeal is incorrect in law, the General Court having wrongly held that the Commission had not erred in its assessment in finding, in the present case, that there was no overriding public interest justifying disclosure of the documents at issue under the final clause of Article 4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001, on the ground that the best way of serving public interest was to complete the EU Pilot procedure with the Federal Republic of Germany. Referring to paragraph 44 of the judgment of 1 July 2008, Sweden and Turco v Council (
