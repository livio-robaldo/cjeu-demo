        <p class="normal">That court having rejected its action, Global Starnet brought an appeal before the Consiglio di Stato (Council of State, Italy) claiming, first, that the principle of protection of legitimate expectations had been infringed, given that Law No 220/2010 authorised the insertion of conditions for the exercise of a concession holder’s activity for the organisation and management of public gaming which essentially amend the existing concession agreement. Next, it maintained that the principle of equal treatment had been infringed, in so far as it finds itself at a disadvantage compared with new competitors who have not incurred debt and that that law is incompatible with the principles of EU law which require the removal of any barrier to the development of the free movement of goods and the freedom to provide services. Finally, Global Starnet submitted that the contested provisions of Law No 220/2010 are unconstitutional in so far as they are contrary to the freedom to conduct a business and that the procurement notice concerning the award of the concession relating to the constitution and operation of the online management network for gaming using entertainment and recreation machines is unlawful because it could lead to the exclusion of Global Starnet from the contract award procedure.</p>

        <p class="normal">On 2 September 2013, the Consiglio di Stato (Council of State) upheld Global Starnet’s appeal in part in its interim ruling. It ruled, in particular, that that company had been forced to participate in the new selection procedure even though, by virtue of the legislation in force on the date of the concession agreement, of which it is a beneficiary, even though a selection procedure for existing concession holders was unnecessary and that a less favourable agreement was unlawfully imposed on that company after it had made an investment in reliance on the fact that the initial concession would continue seamlessly, an agreement which at the same time enabled access for new competitors.</p>

        <p class="normal">On the initiative of the referring court which raised the question of the constitutionality of Article 1(79) of Law No 220/2010, the Corte costituzionale (Constitutional Court, Italy), by its judgment No 56/2015 of 31 March 2015 ruled that the principle of protection of legitimate expectations and legal certainty are values protected by the Italian constitution, but not in absolute terms from which there can be no derogation. As regards public-service concessions, that court held that the possibility of public intervention leading to alteration of the original requirements must be considered inherent in the contractual concession relationship from the start, which is all the more likely to be the case in a field as sensitive as that of public gaming, which calls for the specific, ongoing attention of the national legislature. Therefore, neither those values nor the freedom to conduct a business have been infringed. Furthermore, the constraints imposed by the provisions at issue, in the present case, constitute a minimum measure for restoration of the principle of equal treatment of operators, fully justified by the situation of the existing concession holder, who enjoys an advantage in so far as he has not had to take part in the new selection procedure. In addition, the provisions in question are thus neither manifestly inconsistent with the objectives laid down by the national legislature, nor disproportionate to the content and nature of the contractual concession relationship, nor do they entail unacceptable additional charges. Finally, the Corte costituzionale (Constitutional Court) held that the supposed loss of all or part of the capital invested is at worst merely an indirect consequence of the management constraints imposed by the contested provisions and lies, as such, outside the sphere of protection of the right to be compensated.</p>

In the second place, it has no reason to consider whether it must comply with the interpretation of the Corte costituzionale (Constitutional Court) since judgments of that Court rejecting questions of constitutionality do not bind national courts. In the third place, the referring court, for it considered that the question of the constitutionality of national law was relevant for the purposes of settling the dispute and, therefore, referred questions to the Corte costituzionale (Constitutional Court), held that the national rules at issue were compatible with EU law. In the fourth place, the first question is purely hypothetical and therefore inadmissible, for the referring court was required to refer a question on the possible conflict of the rules at issue in the main proceedings with EU law to the Corte costituzionale (Constitutional Court) before referring that question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling.</p>

          In that regard, it must be borne in mind that, in the context of the cooperation between the Court and the national courts established in Article 267 TFEU, it is solely for the national court before which a dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine in the light of the particular circumstances of the case both the need of a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court. Consequently, when the question put by the national court concerns the interpretation of EU law, the Court is, in principle, bound to give a ruling. The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred for a preliminary ruling by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgment of 7 July 2016, Muladi,

          It should be noted that a national court which, in a case concerning EU law, considers that a provision of national law is not only contrary to EU law, but also unconstitutional, does not lose the right, or escape the obligation under Article 267 TFEU, to refer questions to the Court of Justice on the interpretation or validity of EU law by reason of the fact that the declaration that a rule of national law is unconstitutional is subject to a mandatory reference to the constitutional court. The effectiveness of EU law would be in jeopardy if the existence of an obligation to refer a matter to a constitutional court could prevent a national court hearing a case governed by EU law exercising the right conferred on it by Article 267 TFEU to refer to the Court questions concerning the interpretation or validity of EU law in order to enable it to decide whether or not a provision of national law was compatible with that EU law (judgment of 4 June 2015, Kernkraftwerke Lippe-Ems,

          The Court has concluded from all the above considerations that the functioning of the system of cooperation between the Court of Justice and the national courts established by Article 267 TFEU requires, as does the principle of primacy of EU law, the national court to be free to refer to the Court for a preliminary ruling any question that it considers necessary, at whatever stage of the proceedings it considers appropriate, even at the end of an interlocutory procedure for the review of constitutionality (judgment of 4 June 2015, Kernkraftwerke Lippe-Ems,

          It follows from the foregoing considerations that the effectiveness of EU law would be impaired and the effectiveness of Article 267 TFEU diminished if, as a result of there existing a procedure for review of constitutionality, the national court were precluded from referring questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling and immediately applying EU law in a manner consistent with the Court’s decision or case-law (judgment of 4 June 2015, Kernkraftwerke Lippe-Ems,

          Furthermore, although it is true that the procedure laid down in Article 267 TFEU is an instrument for cooperation between the Court of Justice and the national courts, by means of which the former provides the latter with the points of interpretation of EU law necessary in order for them to decide the disputes before them, the fact remains that when there is no judicial remedy under national law against the decision of a court or tribunal of a Member State, that court or tribunal is, in principle, obliged to bring the matter before the Court of Justice under the third paragraph of Article 267 TFEU where a question relating to the interpretation of EU law is raised before it (see judgment of 9 September 2015, Ferreira da Silva e Brito and Others,

          Moreover, it should be noted that, when a Member State relies on overriding requirements in the public interest in order to justify rules liable to obstruct the exercise of the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services, such justification must also be interpreted in the light of the general principles of EU law, in particular the fundamental rights now guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights.
