          In that connection, it must be recalled that, in the absence of any specific provision in the VAT Directive as to the evidence that taxable persons are required to provide in order to be granted an exemption from VAT, it is for the Member States to lay down, in accordance with Article 131 of that directive, the conditions in which intra-Community supplies of goods will be exempt, with a view to ensuring the correct and straightforward application of those exemptions and of preventing any possible evasion, avoidance or abuse. However, when they exercise their powers, Member States must observe the general principles of law which form part of the European Union legal order (see judgments of 6 September 2012, Mecsek-Gabona,

          According to the Court’s case-law, such a national measure goes further than is necessary to ensure the correct collection of the tax if, in essence, it makes the right of exemption from VAT subject to compliance with formal obligations, without any account being taken of the substantive requirements and, in particular, without any consideration being given as to whether those requirements have been satisfied.

          As regards the objective characteristics of an intra-Community supply, it follows from paragraphs 23 to 25 above that, if a supply of goods satisfies the conditions laid down in Article 138(1) of the VAT Directive, that supply is exempt from VAT (see, to that effect, judgment of 20 October 2016, Plöckl,
