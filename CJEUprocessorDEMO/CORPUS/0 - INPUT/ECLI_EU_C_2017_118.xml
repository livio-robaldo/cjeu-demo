          As is apparent from recital 12 of Regulation No 2201/2003, that regulation was drawn up with the objective of meeting the best interests of the child and, to that end, it favours the criterion of proximity. The EU legislature, in effect, considered that the court geographically close to the child’s habitual residence is the court best placed to assess the measures to be taken in the interests of the child (judgment of 15 July 2010, Purrucker,

          ), the Court held that the meaning and scope of the concept of ‘habitual residence’ must be determined in the light of the best interests of the child and, in particular, of the criterion of proximity.

That place must be established by the national court, taking account of the circumstances of fact specific to each individual case. The conditions and reasons for the child’s stay on the territory of a Member State and the child’s nationality are of particular relevance.

        <p class="normal">On the other hand, the physical presence of child V in another Member State, in this case the Kingdom of the Netherlands, with one of his parents for several years, in accordance with a decision which has become final, in this case the decision of the Vilniaus miesto apylinkės teismas (District Court, Vilnius) of 8 October 2013, is capable of establishing that child V is habitually resident there and of conferring jurisdiction on the courts of that Member State to hear and determine the applications for parental responsibility and maintenance. The position could be different only if there were facts prompting a departure from the rule that jurisdiction usually lies with the place of habitual residence.</p>

In particular, it does not appear either that Child V had moved from Lithuania to the Netherlands before the Vilniaus miesto apylinkės teismas (District Court, Vilnius) was seised or that there was an agreement between the holders of parental responsibility as to the jurisdiction of the Lithuanian courts. Moreover, the referring court makes no mention of an abduction or wrongful retention of child V, nor does it appear that the Lithuanian courts were designated by the Netherlands courts as being best placed to hear the case in the main proceedings.</p>

Even if the jurisdiction of those courts has been accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by X, in accordance with Article 12(1)(b) of Regulation No 2201/2003, that jurisdiction has in any event come to an end, since the decision granting the application for divorce and deciding on parental responsibility has become final, in accordance with Article 12(2)(a) and (b) of that regulation.</p>
