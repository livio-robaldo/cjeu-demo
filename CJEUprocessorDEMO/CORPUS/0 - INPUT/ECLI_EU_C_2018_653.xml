          The Landesarbeitsgericht Berlin-Brandenburg (Higher Labour Court, Berlin-Brandenburg, Germany) takes the view that the outcome of the disputes pending before it depends, in particular, on the interpretation of Article 2(4) of Directive 98/59. In that regard, the referring court notes that Article 17 of the KSchG, which transposes Article 2 of that directive almost word-for-word, gives rise, on a national level, to differences in interpretation, particularly of the concept of ‘undertaking controlling the employer’. Accordingly, a broad interpretation of that concept that also includes undertakings not linked in terms of legislation on groups of companies but subject only to a

          or de facto control could render the redundancies at issue in the main proceedings void, whereas that would not be the case if a restrictive interpretation was applied to that term.

          As a preliminary point, it must be clarified that the concept of ‘control’ for the purposes of Directive 98/59 refers, as the Advocate General noted in point 50 of her Opinion, to a situation in which an undertaking may adopt a strategic or commercial decision compelling the employer to contemplate or to plan for collective redundancies (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 September 2009, Akavan Erityisalojen Keskusliitto AEK and Others,

          Both Directive 98/59 and, before that, Directive 75/129 which it replaced, provide for a partial harmonisation of the rules for the protection of workers in the event of collective redundancies, that is to say, harmonisation of the procedure to be followed when such redundancies are to be effected (judgment of 21 December 2016, AGET Iraklis,

          In that regard, the Court has clarified in the context of that partial harmonisation that the legislature intended, with its adoption of Directive 92/56 and then Directive 98/59, to fill a gap in its earlier legislation and to add clarification concerning the obligations of employers who are part of a group of undertakings. Thus, against an economic background marked by the increasing presence of groups of undertakings, Article 2(4) of Directive 98/59 serves to ensure, where one undertaking is controlled by another, that the purpose of that directive, which, as is stated in recital 2 of its preamble, is to promote greater protection for workers in the event of collective redundancies, is actually achieved (judgment of 10 September 2009, AkavanErityisalojen Keskusliitto AEK and Others,
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2009%3A533&amp;locale=en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch" hreflang="en" class="CourtLink">C‑44/08</a>

          Consequently, the Court has interpreted Article 2(1) and the first subparagraph of Article 2(4) of Directive 98/59 to the effect that, under those provisions, irrespective of whether collective redundancies are contemplated or projected as a result of a decision of the undertaking which employs the workers concerned or a decision of its parent company, it is always the former of those two companies which is obliged, as the employer, to start consultations with the representatives of its workers (judgment of 10 September 2009, Akavan Erityisalojen Keskusliitto AEK and Others,

          With regard to the objective of Directive 98/59, second, it is clear from recital 2 that that is to afford greater protection to workers in the case of collective redundancies. In that regard, the Court has clarified that, under Article 2(2) of the directive, the consultations with workers’ representatives before the collective redundancy are to cover ways and means of avoiding collective redundancies or reducing the number of workers affected, and of mitigating the consequences by recourse to accompanying social measures aimed, inter alia, at aid for redeploying or retraining workers made redundant (judgment of 21 December 2016, AGET Iraklis,
