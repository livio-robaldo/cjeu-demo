          In the context of inter partes proceedings it is essential that the party initiating proceedings state the subject matter of the dispute and give a brief statement of its pleas in law and that the statement be sufficiently clear and precise as to enable the defendant to prepare its defence and the Court to exercise its power of review. It follows from paragraphs 122 and 123 of the judgment of 19 December 2013, Commission v Poland, (

          ), that the purpose of those requirements is to ensure that the Court does not rule ultra petita or indeed fail to rule on a complaint or otherwise fail to rule on the application. For the same reasons, the General Court was incorrect to consider, in paragraph 91 of the judgment under appeal, that Article 44(1) and Article 48(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court of 2 May 1991 impose limits upon it, when those limits in fact relate to the applicant, not the General Court itself.

However, the aggregate result of the General Court’s judgments on the appellant’s application and the applications of the other carriers at issue to annul that decision is to introduce an illogical distinction between the position of the appellant (which benefited only from partial annulment of the decision) and the position of those other carriers (which benefited from full annulment of the decision), notwithstanding the fact that the appellant and the other carriers were in precisely the same situation as regards the General Court’s essential reasoning. That distinction is arbitrary as not all those other carriers raised, in their actions for annulment of the decision at issue, a plea alleging that the decision was vitiated by defective reasoning.</p>

As the operative part of the judgment under appeal limits the scope of the annulment of the decision at issue, the decision still stands in part as against the appellant. As a result of the various defects in that decision — which the General Court found to be sufficiently egregious to constitute violations of rules or principles of public policy — the national courts may find it extremely difficult to clearly discern the delineation of responsibility between the appellant and other parties for any losses they find to have been caused by the conduct described in the decision. This may adversely affect the appellant and, potentially, other parties, including the persons seeking damages.</p>

If that approach were endorsed, that would encourage applicants to seek unjustifiably broad forms of order in an effort to maximise their chances of obtaining a wider scope of annulment in the event that the EU courts might raise an issue of public policy of their own motion. That would mean that the EU courts alone were responsible for determining the precise scope of the annulment. In raising an issue of public policy of their own motion, the EU courts would typically not deal at all with the pleas raised by the applicants. It is therefore entirely possible that even a vexatious or manifestly weak application could — on the General Court’s approach in this case — benefit from a full annulment simply because the applicant had asked for it originally.</p>

          According to the appellant, it was incorrect for the General Court to state, in paragraph 90 of the judgment under appeal, that it is for the parties to apply to amend their pleas or the forms of order sought in the course of the proceedings once the General Court has raised a public policy issue of its own motion. That approach would once again place public policy issues solely in the hands of litigants. Respect for public policy issues raised of the General Court’s own motion cannot be subjugated to the individual interests of
          <span class="italic">inter partes</span>
          litigants. Moreover, the General Court also stated, in paragraph 90 of the judgment under appeal, that it would in any event have refused permission to make such amendments even if the appellant had formally applied. On that basis, it would have been impossible for the public policy issues identified by the General Court to be reflected in the scope of the annulment granted in the operative part of the judgment under appeal.

Accordingly, contrary to what is suggested by the appellant, the General Court did not disregard the fact that those provisions do not concern the circumstances in which the General Court might raise pleas of its own motion or even amend heads of claim on the same basis, but the procedural requirements binding upon applicants in actions before that court with regard to the content of the application.</p>
