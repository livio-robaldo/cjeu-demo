          It can thus be seen from that case-law that particular circumstances may be capable, by virtue of the principle of sincere cooperation arising from Article 4(3) TEU, of requiring a national administrative body to review an administrative decision that has become final to take account of the interpretation of a relevant provision of EU law which the Court has given subsequently. A balance between the requirement for legal certainty and the requirement for legality under EU law is thereby struck (judgment of 4 October 2012, Byankov,

          Contrary to the cases which gave rise to the case-law cited in paragraphs 46 to 48 above, this case does not concern whether the national administrative body in question must review its decision, but whether that body must rectify the duration of the certificate, where the date of the first MA in the European Union, as stated in the application for the certificate laid down in Article 8, is incorrect. The balance between the requirement for legal certainty and the requirement for legality under EU law is, in such circumstances, not the same as that set out in paragraphs 46 and 47 above. A change, such as replacing the date of 24 August 2027, as the date of the expiry of the SPC, with the date of 28 August 2027, as requested by Incyte on the basis of the judgment of 6 October 2015, Seattle Genetics (

          As regards the objectives pursued by Regulation No 469/2009, it should be noted, first, that the fundamental objective of Regulation No 469/2009, as mentioned, inter alia, in recitals 3 to 5 and 8 and 9 of that regulation, is to re-establish a sufficient period of effective protection of a basic patent by permitting the holder to enjoy an additional period of exclusivity on the expiry of his patent, which is intended to compensate, at least in part, for the delay to the commercial exploitation of his invention by reason of the time which has elapsed between the date on which the application for that patent was filed and the date on which the first marketing authorisation in the European Union was granted (see, inter alia, judgment of 6 October 2015, Seattle Genetics,

          Furthermore, as is apparent from recitals 7 and 8 thereof, Regulation No 469/2009 establishes a uniform solution at European Union level by creating an SPC which may be obtained by the holder of a national or European patent under the same conditions in each Member State. It thus aims to prevent the heterogeneous development of national laws leading to further disparities which would be likely to create obstacles to the free movement of medicinal products within the European Union and thus directly affect the establishment and the functioning of the internal market (see, inter alia, judgment of 6 October 2015, Seattle Genetics,
