According to CX, the annual quota infringes the rules of the association between the European Union and the Republic of Turkey, in particular Articles 5 and 6 of Decision No 1/95 of the Association Council, in that it restricts the free movement of goods within the association and discriminates against Turkish hauliers on grounds of their nationality, contrary to Article 9 of the EEC-Turkey Agreement.</p>

In that case, which concerned a tax on heavy goods vehicles which had to be paid when they entered Hungarian territory, both on the outward and on the return journey, the amount of which depended on criteria linked inter alia to the quantity of goods that could be carried and to their destination, the Court found, in paragraphs 45 and 46 of that judgment, that, even though the tax on heavy goods vehicles was not levied on the products transported as such, it was imposed on goods transported by vehicles registered in a third country when they crossed the border, and therefore had to be examined with respect to the rules applicable to the free movement of goods.

The fact, relied on by CX, that the additional cost of a possible use of alternative itineraries or means of transport may have an indirect effect on the movement of the goods is of no relevance in this respect. Such a possible indirect effect of the legislation in question does not invalidate the conclusion that the purpose of the legislation is to impose certain conditions on the provision of transport services.</p>

          It should be recalled here that it is apparent from Article 15 of the EEC-Turkey Association Agreement and Article 42(1) of the Additional Protocol that the provisions of EU law on transport and the acts adopted pursuant to those provisions may be extended by the Association Council to the Republic of Turkey, with due regard to its geographical situation. That implies that the rules to be adopted in this field are not necessarily the same as those applicable under the FEU Treaty, and that the extension to the Republic of Turkey of the transport provisions of the FEU Treaty is merely optional (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 October 2003, Abatay and Others,

          So, as long as the Association Council has not adopted rules on transport services pursuant to Article 15 of the EEC-Turkey Association Agreement and Article 42(1) of the Additional Protocol, the conditions of access of Turkish hauliers to the EU transport market remain governed by the national legislation of the Member States and the bilateral agreements concluded between the Member States and the Republic of Turkey.

As the Advocate General observes in points 79 and 80 of his Opinion, it appears — subject to verification by the referring court — that, having regard to the fact that the quota system provided for by the Austria-Turkey Agreement already existed at the time of the accession of the Republic of Austria to the European Union, there can be no question of a new restriction within the meaning of Article 41(1) of the Additional Protocol.

        <p class="normal">In this respect, it should be observed that Turkish hauliers are not the specific target of the quota system thus established, since the Austrian authorities have concluded agreements of the same kind laying down quotas with other third States. Moreover, Regulation No 1072/2009 lays down an obligation for hauliers established within the European Union to hold Community licences in order to be authorised to carry out their activity in Austrian territory.</p>

        <p class="normal">Consequently, as the Advocate General also observes in point 85 of his Opinion, the different treatment complained of by CX is merely the consequence of the different regulatory frameworks applicable to hauliers established within the European Union, on the one hand, and those established in Turkey or other third States, on the other. While the former are subject to the common rules on international transport, the latter are subject to the rules established by the bilateral agreements negotiated in particular by their State of establishment.</p>
