The definitions should exclude bilateral systems where an investment firm enters into every trade on own account and not as a riskless counterparty interposed between the buyer and seller. The term “system” encompasses all those markets that are composed of a set of rules and a trading platform as well as those that only function on the basis of a set of rules. Regulated markets and MTFs are not obliged to operate a “technical” system for matching orders. A market which is only composed of a set of rules that governs aspects related to membership, admission of instruments to trading, trading between members, reporting and, where applicable, transparency obligations is a regulated market or an MTF within the meaning of this Directive and the transactions concluded under those rules are considered to be concluded under the systems of a regulated market or an MTF. The term “buying and selling interests” is to be understood in a broad sense and includes orders, quotes and indications of interest. The requirement that the interests be brought together in the system by means of non-discretionary rules set by the system operator means that they are brought together under the system’s rules or by means of the system’s protocols or internal operating procedures (including procedures embodied in computer software). …’</p>

In that regard, it points out that, in the EFS system, the fund agent and the broker represent the investment fund and the investor respectively and that the former always executes the orders of the latter.</p>

It points out that that system is operated independently by Euronext, which has been granted an operating licence in that regard. The referring court considers that the EFS system may be regarded as a multilateral system since multiple brokers and fund agents are affiliated to it, the shares of several investment funds are traded in it and several parties place orders in it. According to the referring court, the term ‘third party’ used in that provision, interpreted in the light of common usage, must refer to any user of that system. In addition, buying and selling interests are each brought together within the EFS system, giving rise to contracts, and its operation is subject to the non-discretionary rules contained in two documents entitled ‘

          In that regard, according to the order for reference, the EFS system does, in fact, display some of the characteristics of a regulated market described in that definition. Thus, according to the referring court, it is operated by Euronext and is subject to certain non-discretionary rules, namely those contained in two documents published by that institution, entitled ‘

In addition, Euronext has been authorised to operate the EFS system and there is nothing to suggest that it does not comply with the provisions of Title III of Directive 2004/39; it is for the referring court to verify whether that is the case.
