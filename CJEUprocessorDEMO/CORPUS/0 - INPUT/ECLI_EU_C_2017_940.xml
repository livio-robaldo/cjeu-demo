It is structured in three chapters and distinguishes between the rules governing operations within the Union, which are the subject of Chapter 2 and those governing operations outside the Union, which are the subject of Chapter 3. Chapter 3 of the EIB Guide states that ‘accession States … are progressively incorporating [EU] directives into their legislation. In [this] guide, those countries come under the provisions laid down in Chapter 3, “Operations outside the European Union …”, until the deadline when they were committed to applying the EU Directives on procurement as agreed during their negotiations with the Commission to the extent that they have transposed these Directives into their national legislation at that moment.

In that regard, AMPOST took the view that Directive 2004/18 was applicable to the procedure for the award of the works contract at issue in the case in the main proceedings, since the latter began solely after Romania’s accession to the European Union. In the second place, AMPOST noted that three pre-selection criteria laid down by that contract were more restrictive than those provided for by Directive 2004/18, namely, firstly, a criterion relating to the candidate’s personal situation and in particular, the background of non-performance of contracts, which is contrary to Articles 44 and 45 of Directive 2004/18, and secondly, a criterion relating to the applicant’s financial situation which is contrary to Article 47 of Directive 2004/18 and, thirdly, a criterion relating to the applicant’s experience which does not comply with Article 48 of that directive. In the last place, AMPOST nevertheless noted that the use of those criteria had been authorised under national law, namely OUG No 72/2007, which expressly derogated from OUG No 34/2006, an order transposing Directive 2004/18.</p>

          In support of its action, the CNADNR takes the view that the financial correction of 10% of the value of the eligible expenses of the works contract for the construction of the Arad-Timişoara Lugoj motorway is based on a misinterpretation of the provisions of OUG No 34/2006, of OUG No 72/2007 as well as of Directive 2004/18. The CNADNR submits that the contracting authority cannot be criticised for having set pre-selection criteria that were unlawful or restrictive in the light of that directive, in so far as,
          <span class="italic">ab initio</span>

In view of the change to the source of funding, since the operation was then financed by the Cohesion Fund under the Sectoral Operational Programme ‘Transport 2007-2013’, AMPOST had to ensure that the award of that contract respects the provisions of EU law and, in particular, the public procurement rules.</p>

          As regards the second aspect referred to in paragraph 53, it follows from the definition in Article 2(7) of Regulation No 1083/2006 that an infringement of EU law constitutes an ‘irregularity’, within the meaning of that provision, only if it has, or would have, the effect of prejudicing the general budget of the European Union by charging an unjustified item of expenditure to that budget. Therefore, the Court has held that such an infringement is to be considered to be an irregularity only in so far as it was capable, as such, to have a budgetary impact. By contrast, there is no requirement that the existence of a specific financial impact be shown (judgment of 14 July 2016, Wrocław — Miasto na prawach powiatu,
