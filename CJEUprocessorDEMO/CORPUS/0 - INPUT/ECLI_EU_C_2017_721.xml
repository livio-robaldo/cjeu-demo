        <p class="normal">Next, the Federal Republic of Germany submits that its arguments are confirmed by the historical background to Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112. In that connection, it points out, inter alia that in the first version of the Sixth Directive the combined provisions of Article 28(3)(a) and point 3 of Annex E sought to ensure that the exemption laid down in Article 13A(1)(f) for the supply of services by IGPs of a medical or paramedical nature was applicable, while the Member States could continue to tax similar supplies of services by other IGPs until 31 December 1989. The removal of that possibility with effect from 1 January 1990 has not changed the scope of the exemption at issue, but is aimed more at eliminating certain difficulties of a purely practical nature, outside the system of VAT.</p>

          Second, according to the case-law of the Court, the purpose of the exemption laid down in Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112 is ‘to create an exemption from VAT in order to avoid an entity offering certain services from being required to pay that tax when it has found it necessary to cooperate with other entities by means of a common structure set up to undertake activities essential to the provision of those services’ (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 December 2008, Stichting Centraal Begeleidingsorgaan voor de Intercollegiale Toetsing,

In any event, the possibility to derogate from the exemption in Article 13 A(1)(f) of the Sixth Directive was abolished with effect from 1 January 1990 by Article 1 of the Eighteenth Directive 89/465.

          Furthermore, in order to determine whether the application of the exemption mentioned in Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112 to a specific activity is likely to cause distortion of competition, it is certainly possible for the national legislature to lay down rules which are easily managed and supervised by the competent authorities (see, by analogy, judgment of 24 February 2015, Sopora,

In that judgment, the Court interpreted a different provision from that at issue, namely Article 4(5), second subparagraph, of the Sixth Directive, according to which bodies governed by public law are to be considered taxable persons where treatment as non-taxable persons would lead to significant distortions of competition. In that context, the Court held, in paragraph 40 of that judgment that the treatment of bodies governed by public law as taxable persons, in accordance with that provision, results from the carrying-on, as such, of a given activity, irrespective of whether or not those bodies face competition at the level of the local market on which they engage in that activity. However, it does not follow that the condition relating to the absence of distortion of competition, mentioned in Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112 allow the scope of that exemption to be limited in a general manner.
