        <p class="normal">In support of its action, BigBen France contends that the German courts lack jurisdiction to adopt orders against it that are applicable throughout the European Union and takes the view that such orders can have merely national territorial scope. For its part, Nintendo disputes the limitation of such orders solely to the goods within the supply chain between the defendants in the main proceedings. Nintendo also claims that the defendants in the main proceedings cannot be recognised as having the right to use, in the course of their economic activity and for the purposes of selling their own goods, the images of the goods corresponding to its registered Community designs, whereas the defendants in the main proceedings maintain that such use is in conformity with Regulation No 6/2002. Moreover, Nintendo takes the view that German law should be applied to its claims relating to BigBen Germany and French law to those relating to BigBen France, contrary to what the Landgericht Düsseldorf (Regional Court, Düsseldorf) held.</p>

          In the proceedings before the Court, the defendants in the main proceedings have inter alia contended, referring to that case-law, that some of the claims made by the applicant in the main proceedings seeking the provision of information, accounts and documents by the defendants, an order to pay compensation, the destruction and recall of the goods at issue, reimbursement of the lawyers’ fees and publication of the judgment, depend on the application by the court with jurisdiction of provisions of national law and cannot therefore fall within the same situation of law. As the Advocate General notes in points 45 to 52 of his Opinion, such claims are referred to either in Article 89(1)(d) of Regulation No 6/2002 or in Article 88(2) thereof, each of those provisions referring to national law. It follows that those claims are not governed independently by Regulation No 6/2002, but are a matter of the applicable national law (see, to that effect, judgment of 13 February 2014, H. Gautzsch Großhandel,

          However, the referring court takes the view that the requirement of the same situation of law is satisfied in the cases in the main proceedings, since Nintendo’s claims brought before it against the two defendants in the main proceedings arise in the same situation of law, in particular because of the unitary character of the rights conferred by a Community design, as well as in the light of the partial harmonisation of the means of enforcing intellectual property rights effected by Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights (

          Next, it must be examined whether such an act of reproduction was carried out for the purposes of making ‘citations’. In that regard, Article 20(1)(c) of Regulation No 6/2002 makes no reference to the law of the Member States on the concept of ‘citations’. However, the need for a uniform application of EU law and the principle of equality require the terms of a provision of EU law which makes no express reference to the law of the Member States for the purpose of determining its meaning and scope normally to be given an independent and uniform interpretation throughout the EU; that interpretation must take into account not only the wording of the provision but also its context and the objectives pursued by the rules of which it is part (see, inter alia, judgments of 3 September 2014, Deckmyn and Vrijheidsfonds,

          According to settled case-law, a purely literal interpretation of one or more language versions of a text of EU law, to the exclusion of the others, cannot prevail since the uniform application of EU rules requires that they be interpreted, inter alia, in the light of the versions drawn up in all the languages.

          As regards the objective of Regulation No 6/2002, it should be recalled that, according to recitals 6 and 7 thereof, it establishes the protection of design rights for one area encompassing all the Member States, an enhanced protection for industrial design encouraging innovation and development of new products and investment in their production. The Court has also already stated that the objective of that regulation is to ensure effective protection of registered Community designs (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 February 2012, Celaya Emparanza y Galdos International,

        <p class="normal">In that regard, it should be noted that the act by which an operator uses electronic commerce by offering for sale, on its website targeted at consumers in several Member States, goods infringing the rights conferred by the Community designs, which it is possible to view on the screen and to order via that site, constitutes an offer for sale of those goods. Such an operator is thereby offering within the meaning of Article 19(1) of Regulation No 6/2002 and putting on the market allegedly infringing goods on its website, such conduct falling within the concept of ‘use’ within the meaning of that provision.</p>

Where the same defendant is accused of various acts of infringement committed in various Member States, the correct approach for identifying the event giving rise to the damage is not to refer to each alleged act of infringement, but to make an overall assessment of that defendant’s conduct in order to determine the place where the initial act of infringement at the origin of that conduct was committed or threatened by it.</p>
