According to the Belgian Government, the consequence of that provision is that, in the circumstances to which it relates, Member States are not required to comply with Directive 90/435. Thus, it is of the opinion that Member States can not only refuse to grant the advantages set out in Article 4(1) of that directive, but also hold such charges to be non-deductible in circumstances that do not correspond to the provisions of Article 4(2) of that directive, or even to make use of a provision designed to prevent fraud or abuse within the meaning of Article 1(2) of that same directive that goes beyond what is necessary to prevent fraud or abuse.</p>

          In that regard, it must be recalled that Directive 90/435, as its third recital indicates, seeks, by the introduction of a common system of taxation, to eliminate any disadvantage to cooperation between companies of different Member States as compared with cooperation between companies of the same Member State and thereby to facilitate the grouping together of companies at EU level. That directive thus seeks to ensure the neutrality, in fiscal terms, of the distribution of profits by a subsidiary established in one Member State to its parent company established in another Member State (judgments of 1 October 2009, Gaz de France — Berliner Investissement,
