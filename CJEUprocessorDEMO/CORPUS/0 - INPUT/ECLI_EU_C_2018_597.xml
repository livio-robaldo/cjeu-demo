Regulation No 796/2004 merely specifies that non-compliance with the cross-compliance rules cannot be penalised before it has been found and cannot amend Regulation No 1782/2003. He states that, in accordance with the general principles of law, the penalty for that non-compliance must be imposed having regard to the circumstances existing at the material time. In his submission, Regulation No 73/2009 cannot serve as the basis for a request to reduce aid resulting from events occurring before its entry into force. Furthermore, he points out that the alleged non-compliance with the cross-compliance rules would have unpredictable consequences for him, in that the penalty could be increased by a sum of DKK 1 908 483.08 (Danish krone; approximately EUR 256157) due to the increase of the area eligible for direct payments between the year of that non-compliance and the year of the finding thereof.</p>

It points out that, in its case, the reduction in direct payments is greater if it relates to the year when the non-compliance was found, because of the increase in areas eligible for those payments between the year in which it took place and that of its finding. Such a situation would be contrary to the principles of legal certainty and the protection of legitimate expectations and, from the point of view of contract law, would constitute an unforeseeable consequence.</p>

          However, it cannot be deduced from the wording of Article 66, as the Commission points out, that the reduction should be calculated on the amount of direct payments that has been, or will be, received in the calendar year of that finding. In that regard, it must be recalled that an implementing regulation adopted on the basis of an enabling provision in the basic regulation may not derogate from the provisions of that regulation, to which it is subordinate (judgment of 2 March 1999, Spain v Commission,

          ). Thus, the wording of Article 66(1) cannot be interpreted as meaning that it calls into question the link between the farmer’s behaviour which gave rise to the penalty and that penalty, in derogation from the basic rule laid down in Article 6(1) of Regulation No 1782/2003 that non-compliance with cross-compliance rules leads to a reduction or cancellation of direct payments granted or to be granted in the calendar year in which the non-compliance occurred.

That Article 66 relates in reality to the methods of reducing direct payments for non-compliance with cross-compliance rules and not to the rules for calculation of such a reduction. By reducing the amounts of direct payments that have been or are to be received by the farmer in the calendar year of the finding of the non-compliance, Article 66 of Regulation No 796/2004 guarantees that recovery of the sum corresponding to that reduction will actually be made, by deduction from the payments due to the farmer. By so doing, that article is such as to ensure both the effectiveness of reductions made for non-compliance with cross-compliance rules and the proper use of payments made under the EU agricultural funds.</p>

However, such a risk is not present when the reduction or cancellation of the direct payments is calculated on the basis of the amount of direct payments granted or to be granted in the calendar year in which the non-compliance with the cross-compliance rules occurred, since any change in such factual circumstances subsequent to the occurrence of that non-compliance will have no impact on the financial consequences which he will have to bear.</p>
