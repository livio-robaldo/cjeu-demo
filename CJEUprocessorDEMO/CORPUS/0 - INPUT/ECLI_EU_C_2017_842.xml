          As a preliminary point, it must be borne in mind that, although a contract is characterised by the principle of freedom of the parties to arrange their own affairs, according to which, in particular, parties are free to enter into obligations with each other, limitations on freedom of contract may nonetheless arise from the applicable EU rules (judgment of 20 May 2010, Harms,
