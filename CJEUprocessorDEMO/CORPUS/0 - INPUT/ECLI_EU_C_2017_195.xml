          As stated in paragraph 30 above, the objective of EU law on the valuation of goods for customs purposes is to introduce a fair, uniform and neutral system excluding the use of arbitrary or fictitious customs values. In accordance with point 2 of the interpretative note on customs value concerning Article 31(1) of the Customs Code, set out in Annex 23 to Regulation No 2454/93, the methods of valuation to be used under Article 31(1) should be those laid down in Articles 29 and 30(2) of the Code but a ‘reasonable flexibility’ in the application of those methods would be in conformity with the objectives and provisions of Article 31(1) of the Code (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 February 2008, Carboni e derivati,

          Having regard to the need to establish a customs value if an undertaking fails to provide full information relating to the relevant tax years and to the ‘reasonable flexibility’ mentioned in point 2 of the interpretative note, it must be accepted that taking into account data relating to other tax years of the undertaking may constitute data available in the European Union which Article 31(1) of the Customs Code allows to be used as a basis for determining customs value. Reference to such data constitutes a means of determining a customs value which is both ‘reasonable’ within the meaning of Article 31(1) and consistent with the principles and general provisions of the international agreements and the provisions referred to in Article 31(1) (see, by analogy, judgment of 28 February 2008, Carboni e derivati,
