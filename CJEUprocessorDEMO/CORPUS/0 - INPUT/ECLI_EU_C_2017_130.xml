        <p class="normal">In the second place, the Spyder has a steering geometry which satisfies the Ackermann principle and it otherwise has a steering system that is significantly different from that of a motor car. Instead of a steering wheel, it is fitted with a handlebar like that of a motorcycle, with two handles on which the controls are mounted. Unlike a steering wheel, that handlebar cannot be completely rotated: the maximum deflection to the left and to the right is about 45 degrees, like that of a motorcycle. Moreover, there is no universal joint and no steering box, like in a motor car, by means of which the rotating motion of the steering shaft is converted into a linear movement, whereas the rotating motion of the steering shaft of the Spyder is converted into that movement in a different way, namely by means of a ‘pitman arm’. The similarities with the steering mechanism of a motor car are confined to the presence of a steering shaft, tie rods, wheels and the already mentioned steering geometry which satisfies the Ackermann principle. Nevertheless, the referring court considers that it does not appear explicitly from the wording of the HS Explanatory Note relating to heading 8703 that the presence, in a lightweight three-wheeled vehicle, of a steering system based on the Ackermann principle is sufficient to warrant a reference to a motor car type steering system as is the case with respect to four-wheeled vehicles according to the HS Explanatory Note relating to heading 8703, point 6.</p>

          In that regard, it should be noted that, according to the Court’s settled case-law, the Council of the European Union has conferred upon the Commission, acting in cooperation with the customs experts of the Member States, broad discretion to define the subject matter of tariff headings falling to be considered for the classification of particular goods. However, the Commission’s power to adopt the measures mentioned in Article 9(1)(a), (b), (d) and (e) of Regulation No 2658/87, like drafting additional notes, does not authorise it to alter the subject matter of the tariff headings which have been defined on the basis of the HS established by the International HS Convention whose scope the European Union has undertaken, under Article 3 thereof, not to modify (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 February 2015, Raytek and Fluke Europe,
