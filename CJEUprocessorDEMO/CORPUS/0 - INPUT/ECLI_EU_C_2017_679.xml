          It is apparent from paragraph 9 of the first judgment under appeal and from paragraph 10 of the second judgment under appeal (together, ‘the judgments under appeal’) that, by the contested decision, the European Commission found that the main global producers of cathode ray tubes (‘CRTs’) had infringed Article 101 TFEU and Article 53 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area of 2 May 1992 (
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1994:001:TOC" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab">OJ 1994 L 1, p. 3</a>
          ) (‘the EEA Agreement’) by participating in two separate infringements, each constituting a single and continuous infringement. Those infringements concerned, on the one hand, the market for colour cathode tubes for computer monitors (colour display tubes; ‘CDTs’) and, on the other hand, the market for colour cathode tubes for television sets (colour picture tubes; ‘CPTs’).

LGE argues that it is apparent from the judgment of 22 January 2013, Commission v Tomkins (

LGE maintains that such a duty is relevant only in cases where the parent company assigns a subsidiary to a third party and it can thus be contractually assured of continued access to the documents.

        <p class="normal">In the same way as LGE, Philips states that its subsidiary was no longer part of the same undertaking during the administrative proceedings, since it had been under the control of a liquidator since 30 January 2006. Philips states that, because its subsidiary was not involved in the administrative proceedings and did not receive, in particular, the statement of objections, the latter had no opportunity or obligation to defend itself against the Commission’s allegations. In addition, having regard to the insolvency of its subsidiary, Philips asserts that it was impossible for it to ensure access to those documents so as to have the necessary evidence to enable it to defend itself. Further, only the liquidator of the LPD group was supposedly in possession of the documents relating to the group’s business and had access to the relevant employees.</p>

          In this respect, Philips submits that, as a joint venture fulfilling, in the long term, all the functions of an independent economic entity, the LPD group must be found to be an independent economic entity on the market and, consequently, an undertaking distinct from its parent companies. If such a joint venture were held to be part of the same undertaking as its two parent companies, Article 101 TFEU would not apply to the agreements between that common undertaking and its parent companies, something which would be contrary to Council Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 of 20 January 2004 on the control of concentrations between undertakings (‘the EC Merger Regulation’) (

LGE submits that direct EEA sales through transformed products are downstream sales of transformed products, made by LGE and Philips, and could not be attributed to the LPD group.

In this context LGE submits that, even if it were admitted that sales between the LPD group and Philips constitute intragroup sales, it is those sales alone between the LPD group and Philips that are intragroup sales. Even assuming that the LPD group and Philips are vertically integrated, LGE maintains that it is not part of such a vertically integrated undertaking. Consequently, it is LGE’s submission that the General Court should have annulled the contested decision, at the very least because the decision held that LGE was liable for the fine, but also because the fine had been calculated on the basis of the LPD group’s direct EEA sales through transformed products made with Philips as intermediary.</p>

However, LGE submits that it is not liable for the gravity reflected by such sales made by Philips. Thus, LGE claims that it has had a fine imposed upon it that does not correctly reflect the gravity of the infringement imputed to it. In that context, LGE provides detailed figures on the volume of the LPD group’s direct EEA sales through transformed products made with LGE and Philips as intermediary respectively in order to demonstrate that the volume of sales with Philips as intermediary was 26 times greater.

          Next, it is apparent from the case-law of the Court of Justice that, although Article 23(2) of Regulation No 1/2003 leaves the Commission a certain discretion in determining the amount of the fine, it nevertheless limits the exercise of that discretion by establishing objective criteria to which the Commission must adhere. Thus, first, the amount of the fine that may be imposed on an undertaking is subject to a quantifiable and absolute ceiling, such that the maximum amount of the fine that may be imposed on a given undertaking can be determined in advance. Second, the exercise of that discretion is also limited by rules of conduct which the Commission imposed on itself, in particular in the Guidelines on the method of setting fines (judgment of 9 July 2015, InnoLux v Commission,

As the General Court established in paragraph 135 of the first judgment under appeal and in paragraph 148 of the second judgment under appeal, the CRTs provided by the LPD group to its two parent companies were installed in the television sets and the computer monitors in question. In addition, it follows from paragraph 137 of the first judgment under appeal and from paragraph 157 of the second judgment under appeal that those sales were taken into account only up to the proportion of their value that was capable of corresponding to the value of the cartelised CRTs installed in the television sets and computer monitors.</p>

Only direct EEA sales and direct EEA sales through transformed products were taken into account to calculate the amount of the fine. In those circumstances, the fact that the category of direct EEA sales through transformed products was applied only in the case of some of those which participated in the cartel, namely to those whom the Commission was able to prove belonged to a vertically integrated undertaking, does not amount to discrimination, since the Commission assessed the applicability of that category to each of the participants on the basis of the same objective criteria.</p>
