          ). On the basis of that judgment, Madbid concluded that it was liable for VAT not on the issuing of credits for the benefit of its clients, but only on the supplies of goods. The consideration for those supplies was made up of the price paid by the client for the product that he purchased and the value of the ‘credits’ exhausted in purchasing that product. In the alternative, Madbid submitted before the referring court that, if the latter held that the issue of ‘credits’ was a supply of services, it would be necessary to regard such a supply as not effected for consideration, for the purposes of Article 2(1)(c) and Article 73 of the VAT Directive.

        <p class="normal">The referring court also states that, in a decision of 9 July 2014, the Finanzamt Hannover-Nord (Hanover-Nord Tax Office, Germany) considered that the sale of ‘credits’ by Madbid was neither the supply of goods nor the supply of services for the purposes of VAT. According to that tax office, Madbid is liable for VAT in Germany for supplies of goods that it makes to users established in that Member State. The consideration for those supplies of goods is not only the price paid by the client for the goods purchased, namely the price at which the auction was won, the price resulting from use of the ‘buy now’ feature or the price after deduction of the ‘earned discount’, but also the value of the ‘credits’ used for the purpose of acquiring that product, namely the value of the ‘credits’ that enabled the winning bid to be made in the auction or that generated the price discount through use of the ‘buy now’ or ‘earned discount’ feature. As regards users who bought ‘credits’ and participated in the auction without winning it, the Hanover-Nord Tax Office considers that a supply of services was effected for the benefit of those users only if they do not make any purchase using the value of the ‘credits’ that enabled them to bid. The consideration for that supply of services, subject to VAT in the United Kingdom, is the value of those ‘credits’.</p>

          It should be recalled that in that judgment the Court held that the acquisition of contractual rights, called ‘points rights’, allowing points to be received which may be converted, in particular, into a right to occupy temporarily accommodation in the tourist complexes of the service provider was not a transaction subject to VAT, but a preliminary transaction effected in order to be able to exercise the right to temporarily use a property, or to stay in a hotel or use another service. The Court found that the purchase of ‘points rights’ was not an objective in itself for the client since the client concluded the initial contract not with the intention of collecting those points, but in order temporarily to use accommodation or obtain other services selected later (judgment of 16 December 2010, MacDonald Resorts,
