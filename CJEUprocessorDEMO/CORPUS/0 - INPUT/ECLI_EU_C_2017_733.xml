          It is settled case-law of the Court that the interpretation of the terms used to define the exemptions must be consistent with the objectives pursued by those exemptions, guarantee their effects and comply with the principle of fiscal neutrality (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 March 2013, PFC Clinic,

        <p class="normal">Lastly, with regard to the objective pursued by the exemption at issue in the main proceedings, the Italian Government argues that that exemption seeks to avoid situations of double taxation, explaining that, in the situation where the transport costs are exempted from VAT for customs purposes, they should be liable to VAT, even if the consideration is included in the taxable amount. FedEx and the Commission take the view, by contrast, that the purpose of the exemption is technical simplification and, therefore, the application of such an exemption is independent of whether the transport costs are subjected to VAT for customs purposes. Consequently, in their view, the transport costs relating to importations are exempt from VAT on the basis of Article 144 of the VAT Directive, in so far as their value is included in the taxable amount.</p>
