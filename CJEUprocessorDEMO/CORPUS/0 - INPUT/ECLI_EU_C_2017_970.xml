In other words, under that system the VAT on the products sold by Avon to the representatives is calculated on the basis not of the price excluding tax at which Avon sells them those products, but of the price at which the representatives are deemed to resell them to their customers, that excess VAT being borne by Avon. However, in practice the Commissioners make two adjustments to that calculation in order to take account of the fact that some products are purchased by non-taxable representatives for their personal use and that the latter sell some products at a discount.</p>

It inferred from this that that provision creates unfair competition between Avon and entities which sell through taxable retailers.
