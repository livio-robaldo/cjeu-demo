          That requirement of service, with the associated transmission of information about an appeal, ensures that the party against whom enforcement is sought has a right to an effective remedy.

          The Court held in those judgments that an anti-suit injunction, that is to say, an injunction intended to prohibit a person from commencing or continuing proceedings before the courts of another Member State, was incompatible with the Convention concluded on 27 September 1968 on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1978:304:TOC" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab">OJ 1978 L 304, p. 36</a>

          ), since such an injunction does not observe the principle that every court seised itself determines, under the rules applicable to it, whether it has jurisdiction to resolve the dispute before it. Such an interference with the jurisdiction of a court of another Member State is also incompatible with the system of mutual trust which forms the basis for the establishment of a mandatory system of jurisdiction which all courts falling within the scope of those legal instruments are required to respect (judgments of 27 April 2004, Turner,
