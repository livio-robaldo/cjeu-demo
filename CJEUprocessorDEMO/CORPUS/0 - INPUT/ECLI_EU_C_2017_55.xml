In respect of on-the-spot checks on commitments other than those relating to the area, point 7.2 specifies that counting of animals should be undertaken.

That programme was approved by Commission Decision C(2007) 3446 final of 19 July 2007. It accordingly states that the payment of compensation for forage areas to farmers located in areas of natural handicaps is subject to compliance by the latter with a stocking criterion. This criterion, expressed as a unit of livestock per hectare (‘LU’), allows the density of livestock on forage areas to be controlled so as to avoid under-grazing or overgrazing.

          Accordingly, in paragraphs 73 to 76 of that judgment, the General Court rejected the argument that the existence of on-the-spot checks carried out for the purpose of establishing databases relieved the French authorities of the need to carry out on-the-spot checks under Article 12 et seq. of Regulation No 1975/2006. In its view, the arguments of the French Republic concerning the reliability of the national database were not relevant in that regard. On the one hand, it considered that the administration and control rules provided for in that regulation constituted specific measures in those areas. On the other hand, it considered that the checks carried out for the establishment of that database could not be regarded as on-the-spot checks within the meaning of that regulation, since the aim of those checks was not to assess the particular conditions of the measures in support of rural development, but to verify compliance of all the animals on a holding for which identification of bovine animals is provided for under Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 820/97 (

According to the Commission, although the required number of LUs must be present on a holding throughout the reference year, it does not follow that the on-the-spot checks provided for in Regulation No 1975/2006 should not be carried out. The General Court stated that the purpose of those checks is to verify that the information contained in the databases used to carry out administrative checks is correct and that those databases are accurate. It thus noted, in paragraph 82 of the judgment under appeal, that the counting of animals during on-the-spot checks made it possible to carry out the checks required under Regulation No 1975/2006 and to ensure the conformity of the databases when calculating the stock density, even if this did not make it possible to take account of the parameter relating to the time spent by the animals on a holding or, in a precise manner, the parameter relating to the age of the bovine animals.</p>

          ), that the General Court had erred in law by considering that the Commission was not required to comply with any legal time limit for adopting decisions imposing the financial correction. The French Republic considers that allowing the Commission to adopt such decisions after the expiry of the time limit is contrary not only to the general principle of good administration but also to the principle of loyal cooperation between the parties, in so far as Member States are, for their part, subject to strict time limits.

Thus, it does not appear from that decision that the Commission considered that the controls put in place by the French authorities were governed by Article 15(3) of Regulation No 1975/2006 and Article 35 of Regulation No 796/2004. Moreover, the General Court erred in interpreting and applying Article 15(3) of Regulation No 1975/2006 and Article 35 of Regulation No 796/2004, by considering that the CANH control system had to comply with the controls provided for in those provisions, which apply to the control of animal-related measures and not to area-related measures. Article 37(1) of Regulation No 1698/2005 and the Annex to that regulation provide that CANHs are area-related measures within the meaning of Article 6(2)(a) of Regulation No 1975/2006.</p>

According to the French Republic, Article 14(2) of Regulation No 1975/2006, on which the decision at issue is based and which the General Court did not examine, provides that on-the-spot checks cover all commitments which can be checked at the time of the visit. Counting animals during a visit (i) does not make it possible to verify compliance with this criterion, which is expressed in LUs, (ii) depends on the age of the animals and (iii) requires compliance with average thresholds over the course of a year.</p>

The database used to calculate the stock density provides sufficient guarantees of reliability to allow the conclusion that the use of the data derived from it is a suitable means of verifying the conditions for the granting of CANH. Consequently, the General Court should have taken the view that, within the meaning of Article 10(2), those control arrangements ensured suitable verification of the conditions for the granting of CANH, since the stock density criterion was not, moreover, a commitment which could be checked by counting the animals at the time of the visit.</p>

The French authorities were therefore required during the on-the-spot checks to determine the stocking criterion by counting the animals present on the holding at the time of the inspection visit, a count which moreover was provided for in point 7.2 of the CANH circular, in order to verify whether that criterion was adhered to punctually and thus to corroborate the data emerging from the administrative checks.</p>

          First, it submits that its argument before the General Court that the on-the-spot checks already carried out in the context of managing that identification or those premiums relieved the French authorities of the obligation to count the animals during the on-the-spot checks is based on Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) No 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001 (

          ) and No 1975/2006. First, the second paragraph of Article 26 of Regulation No 1782/2003 provides that Member States may, for the purposes of applying EU or national support schemes, incorporate in their administration and control procedures one or more components of the integrated administration and control system in order to avoid any duplication of sectoral checks of the same type. Second, it is apparent from Article 5(2) of Regulation No 1975/2006 that, where possible, on-the-spot checks provided for in Articles 12, 20 and 27 of that regulation and other checks provided for in rules regarding agricultural subsidies are to be carried out at the same time.

In its view, those recitals state that specific administration and control rules should be laid down in order to take account of the special characteristics of the support schemes under Axis 2. The content and eligibility criteria of those schemes are to be defined by the Member States. In those circumstances, the Commission could not lay down, in that regulation, specific control measures which the Member States would have to put in place in order to verify that the eligibility conditions for each aid measure defined in Axis 2 was complied with.</p>

In the Court’s view, the administration and control rules laid down by Regulation No 1975/2006 constituted specific measures in those areas and the verifications carried out for the establishment of the databases did not constitute such checks, since those checks were intended not ‘to assess the particular conditions of the measures in support of rural development’, but to verify compliance of all the animals on a holding for which identification of bovine animals is provided for under Regulation No 1760/2000.</p>

        <p class="normal">As a preliminary point, it must be observed that, while the French Republic refers to ewe premiums in the wording of its third ground, in paragraph 74 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court referred to the on-the-spot checks carried out in the context of the administration of beef premiums, which the appeal indeed refers to in the arguments in support of that ground. Consequently, in so far as it relates to ewe premiums, that ground must be declared inadmissible for lack of precision.</p>
