In the present case, the discounts in favour of private health insurance companies do not therefore reduce the taxable amount for VAT due in respect of the supplies made by Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma, since private health insurance companies who benefit from the discount are not part of the supply chain leading from that company to the final consumer.</p>

          Next, it must also be recalled that Article 90(1) of the VAT Directive, which relates to cases of cancellation, refusal or total or partial non-payment, or where the price is reduced after the supply takes place, requires the Member States to reduce the taxable amount and, consequently, the amount of VAT payable by the taxable person whenever, after a transaction has been concluded, part or all of the consideration has not been received by the taxable person. That provision embodies one of the fundamental principles of the VAT Directive, according to which the taxable amount is the consideration actually received and the corollary of which is that the tax authorities may not collect an amount of VAT exceeding the tax which the taxable person received (judgment of 15 May 2014, Almos Agrárkülkereskedelmi,

          Finally, the Court has held that one of the principles on which the VAT system was based was neutrality, in the sense that within each country similar goods should bear the same tax burden whatever the length of the production and distribution chain (judgment of 24 October 1996, Elida Gibbs,

          Thus, as a result of that legislation, Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma could dispose of a sum corresponding to the price of the sale of those products to pharmacies, reduced by that discount. It would not therefore be in conformity with the VAT Directive for the taxable amount used to calculate the VAT chargeable to the pharmaceutical company, as a taxable person, to exceed the sum finally received by him. If that were the case, the principle of neutrality of VAT vis-à-vis taxable persons, of whom the pharmaceutical company is one, would not be complied with (see, to that effect, the judgment of 24 October 1996, Elida Gibbs,

          However, in that regard, it must be held, first, that, also in paragraph 31 of that judgment, the Court stated that that provision is an expression of the principle of neutrality and, consequently, its application must not undermine the achievement of that principle (see, to that effect, the judgment of 24 October 1996, Elida Gibbs,

          In the second place, it is clear from the case-law of the Court that Article 90(1) of the VAT Directive does not presuppose such a subsequent modification of the contractual relations in order for it to be applicable. In principle, it requires the Member States to reduce the taxable amount whenever, after a transaction has been concluded, part or all of the consideration has not been received by the taxable person. Moreover, there is no indication that in its judgment of 24 October 1996, Elida Gibbs (
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1996%3A400&amp;locale=en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch" hreflang="en" class="CourtLink">C‑317/94</a>

          ), the Court wished to restrict the scope of application of Article 11C(1) of the Sixth Directive which corresponds to Article 90 of the VAT Directive. On the contrary, it is apparent from the facts of the Elida Gibbs case that there had been no modification of the contractual relations. Nevertheless, the Court held that Article 11C(1) of the Sixth Directive was applicable (see, to that effect, the judgment of 29 May 2001, Freemans,

          As the Advocate General observed in points 44 and 45 of his opinion, the payments made at the point of purchase of the medicinal products must be regarded as consideration provided by a third party within the meaning of Article 73 of the VAT Directive when those third parties, namely insured persons, requested reimbursement by the private health insurance companies and the latter obtained, in accordance with the national law, the discount owed to them by the pharmaceutical company. Therefore, having regard to the facts at issue in the main proceedings, the private health insurance companies must be regarded as being the final consumer of a supply made by a pharmaceutical company, which is a taxable person for the purposes of VAT, such that the amount payable to the tax authority may not exceed that paid by the final consumer (see, to that effect, the judgment of 24 October 1996, Elida Gibbs,
