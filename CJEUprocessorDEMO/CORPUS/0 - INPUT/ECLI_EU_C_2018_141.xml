Such exclusivity entails a right to make decisions on the part of veterinary surgeons, which can be effective only if all, or a significant majority, of the share capital of veterinary pharmacies and veterinary pharmaceutical outlets is held by registered veterinary practitioners. Moreover, that is why the Charter of Veterinary Practitioners provides that only pharmacies or pharmaceutical outlets all of whose shareholders are veterinary practitioners may be registered in the single register of veterinary practices. However, as the requirement to submit a certificate of entry in that register was abolished by Order No 31/2015 of the Veterinary Health and Food Safety Authority, there can no longer be any guarantee that the requirement relating to the holding of share capital will be observed.</p>

          Accordingly, the Court has accepted, in particular, that a requirement designed to restrict the sale of medicinal products to certain professionals may be justified because of the safeguards which such professionals must provide and the information which they must be in a position to furnish to consumers (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 19 May 2009, Commission v Italy,

If veterinary substances are not administered correctly or are administered in inappropriate quantities, either they may have no therapeutic effect or, if used in too great a quantity, they may, in particular, result in the presence of such traces in food products of animal origin and, in some instances, in the long term, in resistance to treatment for certain bacteria present in the food chain.</p>

          With regard to the second element of the third condition, namely that the requirement concerned should not go beyond what is necessary to attain the objective in question, it should be noted that the protection of public health ranks foremost among the assets or interests protected by the EU Treaty and that it is for the Member States to determine the degree of protection which it wishes to afford to public health and the way in which that degree of protection is to be achieved. As this may vary from one Member State to another, Member States must be allowed a measure of discretion (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 September 2008, Commission v Germany,

          Such discretion is especially important where, if there is uncertainty as to the existence or extent of risks to human health, a Member State must be able to take protective measures without having to wait until the reality of those risks becomes fully apparent. In particular, Member States must be able to take any measure capable of reducing, as far as possible, a health risk, including a risk to the reliability and quality of the provision of medicinal products to the public (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 December 2013, Venturini and Others,

Accordingly, national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings goes beyond what is necessary to attain the objective pursued by the legislation.</p>
