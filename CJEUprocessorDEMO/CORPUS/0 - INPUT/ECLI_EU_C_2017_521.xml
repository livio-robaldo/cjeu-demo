In order to reduce the administrative burden for Member States, when granting aid covered by this Regulation to SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises], the definition of what is to be considered an undertaking in difficulty should be simplified as compared to the definition used in those Guidelines. Moreover, SMEs which have been incorporated for less than three years should not be considered, for the purposes of this Regulation, to be in difficulty with regard to that period, unless they fulfil the criteria under the relevant national law for being the subject of collective insolvency proceedings. That simplification should be without prejudice to the qualification of those SMEs under those Guidelines with regard to aid not covered by this Regulation and without prejudice to the qualification as undertakings in difficulty of large enterprises, under this Regulation, which remain subject to the full definition provided in those Guidelines.

        <p class="normal">It must then be noted, as is clear from recital 15 of Regulation No 800/2008, that the definition of what is to be considered an ‘undertaking in difficulty’ should be simplified as compared to the definition used in the Guidelines in order to reduce the administrative burden for Member States when granting aid covered by this regulation to SMEs. Consequently, Article 1(7) of Regulation No 800/2008 simply reproduces the information about the concept of ‘undertaking in difficulty’ set out in point 10 of the Guidelines, but does not reproduce those set out in point 11 thereof.</p>
