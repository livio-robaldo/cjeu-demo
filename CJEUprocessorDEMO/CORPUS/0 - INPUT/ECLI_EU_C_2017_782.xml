Article 54 of that law provides for a fine of EUR 3001 to EUR 15000 for serious infringements. In order to determine whether a ‘serious infringement’ has been committed, the law refers to the LOCM, Article 65(1)(c) of which classifies selling at a loss as a serious infringement. The criteria to be taken into account in calculating the amount of the fine are listed in Article 55 of Regional Law 11/2006, which mentions, in particular, the seriousness of the harm ‘caused to the interests of consumers’.</p>

This gives rise to the duty, on the part of the ordinary legislature, to create the necessary mechanisms to prevent the risk of that principle being distorted by unfair practices which have the potential to disrupt the functioning of the market as far as competition is concerned.</p>

Next, it took account of ‘the social implications of the infringement, which affects all traders and consumers in the Region of Murcia … as the infringing party has various economic objectives, including, amongst others, that of creating offers on products such as those at issue here which act as bait or as a hook in order to persuade consumers to purchase goods or services at the same establishment and with the covert intention of discouraging or eliminating competition’. Lastly, it took into account, in setting the penalty, the criterion of ‘the serious harm caused to the interests of consumers’ laid down in Article 55 of Regional Law 11/2006. However, it did not specify to what extent Europamur’s conduct had actually harmed the interests of consumers, given that, in keeping with the most widely held interpretation of Article 14 of the LOCM, selling at a loss would, in itself, be liable to cause harm to consumers and customers.</p>

It also argued that the penalty imposed was contrary to EU law since the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive had been inadequately transposed into domestic law by Law 29/2009, in so far as that law had failed to amend the wording of Article 14 of the LOCM.</p>

Furthermore, according to the referring court, that objective applies even in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which relates to sales by wholesalers to small retailers, since those sales affect the consumer. More specifically, the consumer when shopping at a small retailer is said to benefit from collective purchasing through the wholesaler, without whom the retailer is powerless against the big chains and large retail outlets which have superior purchasing power.</p>

          As regards, in the second place, whether the prohibition on selling at a loss at issue in the main proceedings is general in nature within the meaning of the case-law or whether the derogations from that prohibition allow national courts to establish, having regard to the facts of each particular case, whether the sale at a loss at issue is ‘unfair’ in the light of the criteria set out in Articles 5 to 9 of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, it should be borne in mind that Article 5 of that directive sets out the criteria which determine the circumstances in which a commercial practice must be considered to be unfair and therefore prohibited (order of 7 March 2013, Euronics Belgium,

          In that regard, the Court has held that the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive fully harmonises the rules relating to unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices and that the Member States may therefore not adopt stricter measures than those provided for in the directive, as expressly laid down in Article 4 thereof, even in order to achieve a higher level of consumer protection (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 January 2010, Plus Warenhandelsgesellschaft,

          Furthermore, the more restrictive measures which are prohibited also include, as noted by the Advocate General in points 62 to 64 of his Opinion, the reversal of the burden of proof provided for in Article 14 of the LOCM. Given that selling at a loss is not included among the practices referred to in Annex I to the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, the imposition of a penalty for infringement of the prohibition of such selling at a loss must be preceded by an analysis, undertaken having regard to the facts of each particular case, of whether that selling is ‘unfair’ in the light of the criteria set out in Articles 5 to 9 of that directive, and cannot be based on a presumption which the trader is required to rebut (see, by analogy, judgment of 23 April 2009, VTB-VAB and Galatea,
