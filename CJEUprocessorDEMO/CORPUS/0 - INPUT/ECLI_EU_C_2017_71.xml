In the light of what is held in paragraphs 48 and 66 of the present judgment, it is not a prerequisite for the application of those provisions, read together, that an applicant for international protection should have instigated a terrorist act or should have otherwise participated in the commission of such an act.</p>

His logistical support to the activities of that group has an international dimension in so far as he was involved in the forgery of passports and assisted volunteers who wanted to travel to Iraq.</p>

The same is true, in the light of what is stated in paragraphs 41 to 54 and 66 to 70 of the present judgment, of the fact, mentioned by the referring court in its third question, that Mr Lounani has not committed, nor attempted to commit, nor threatened to commit terrorist offences, within the meaning of Article 1(1) of Framework Decision 2002/475. For the same reasons, the application of Article 12(3) of Directive 2004/83 does not require it to be established that Mr Lounani instigated such offences or that he otherwise participated in such offences.</p>
