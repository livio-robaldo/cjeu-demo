          ), the Court of Justice held that Ireland, by authorising deforestation without a prior environmental impact assessment, had failed to fulfil its obligations under EU law. The referring court notes that, in paragraph 109 of that judgment, the Court of Justice referred to the environmental sensitivity of the geographical area concerned, which is one of the relevant selection criteria in Annex III to Directive 2011/92 and which must be considered having regard, inter alia, to ‘the absorption capacity of the natural environment’, paying particular attention to mountain and forest areas. The referring court takes the view that such considerations could be understood as a broadening of the concept of ‘deforestation for the purposes of conversion to another type of land use’ within the meaning of point 1(d) of Annex II to Directive 2011/92, or even as an indication that another interpretation of that concept which differs from that set out in paragraph 22 of the present judgment must be envisaged.

          That interpretation is not in any way called into question by the fact that the Austrian legislature’s aim, in authorising the practice of such clearances of paths, was allegedly to protect forests. First, the Court has held that the pursuit of beneficial effects on the environment was irrelevant in determining whether it was necessary to make a project subject to an assessment of its environmental effects (see, to that effect, judgment of 25 July 2008, Ecologistas en Acción-CODA,
