          ), given that, as opposed to the relevant facts of the case that gave rise to that judgment, X does not receive all or almost all his family income in a single Member State, other than that of his residence, which has the power to tax that income and which could, therefore, take account of his personal and family circumstances. X’s situation is characterised by the fact that, when those circumstances were to be taken into account in calculating his income tax, he was resident in Spain, where he received no income, and he was receiving his income partly in the Netherlands, at 60%, and partly in Switzerland, at 40%.

What remains the decisive criterion is whether it is impossible for a Member State to take into account, for the calculation of tax, the personal and family circumstances of a taxpayer in the absence of sufficient taxable income, although such circumstances can otherwise be taken into account when there is sufficient income.

          It follows, in particular, that the freedom of the Member States, in the absence of unifying or harmonising measures adopted under EU law, to allocate among themselves their powers to impose taxes, in particular to avoid the accumulation of tax advantages, must be reconciled with the necessity that taxpayers of the Member States concerned are assured that, ultimately, all their personal and family circumstances will be duly taken into account, irrespective of how the Member States concerned have allocated that obligation amongst themselves. Were such reconciliation not to take place, the freedom of Member States to allocate the power to impose taxes among themselves would be liable to create inequality of treatment of the taxpayers concerned which, since that inequality would not be the result of disparities between the provisions of national tax law, would be incompatible with freedom of establishment (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 December 2013, Imfeld and Garcet,

          It must, in that regard, be recalled that as regards the obligation, stemming from the provisions of the FEU Treaty relating to freedom of establishment, not to discriminate against a self-employed person who performs a professional activity within a Member State other than that where he is resident, those provisions must be interpreted as meaning that all Member States are subject to that obligation.
