All the delegates expressed their approval of the political agreement, with the exception of the Spanish and Portuguese delegates, who submitted a statement for inclusion in the Council’s minutes. In that statement the Kingdom of Spain argued that the allocation of the common TACs established for roundnose grenadier and roughhead grenadier did not comply with the principle of relative stability of fishing activities on the basis of the historic catches of each Member State.</p>

As evidenced by recital 7 in the preamble to Regulation No 1367/2014, that decision was adopted on the basis of the scientific advice and recent discussions in the NEAFC. However, the NEAFC’s scientific advice was not conclusive as to the question whether it was necessary to establish a common TAC for both grenadier species.</p>

It is also stated in that advice that there are considerable differences between the data concerning landings of catches of roughhead grenadier and roundnose grenadier. The ICES accordingly concluded that, in order to establish a fishery for roughhead grenadier, it was necessary to obtain more complete and detailed information on catches and landings. It is thus clear from that advice that there is no clear scientific data supporting a conclusion that both species occurred in management zones 5B67 and 8X14.</p>

          As regards, first of all, the Council’s allegedly exceeding the bounds of its discretion, it should first be borne in mind that when it is fixing TACs and allocating fishing opportunities among the Member States, the Council has to evaluate a complex economic situation. In such circumstances, the Council’s discretion is not limited to the nature and scope of the measures to be taken but extends, to some degree, to the finding of the basic facts. In reviewing the exercise of such a power, the Court must confine itself to examining whether there has been a manifest error or misuse of power or whether the authority in question has clearly exceeded the bounds of its discretion (see to that effect, judgments of 19 February 1998, NIFPO and Northern Ireland Fishermen’s Federation,

Next, the scientific advice available to the European Union legislature refers to the possibility that high reported catches of roughhead grenadier originating principally from a single Member State, namely the Kingdom of Spain, relate to catches of roundnose grenadier misreported as catches of roughhead grenadier. Lastly, the Council did not establish a new TAC for roughhead grenadier and therefore did not allocate a new fishing possibility, but merely established, for 2015 and 2016 only, a common TAC for both species.</p>

By contrast, in taking the approach it did, consisting initially of not taking account of those catches as reported in the calculation of national quotas, the Council avoided providing assurances in that regard that were liable to give rise to a legitimate expectation, whilst retaining the right to establish, once the information on reported catches had been verified and conclusive scientific advice had been lodged, quotas based on established data which could therefore be considered equitable quotas.</p>

        <p class="normal">Thus, first of all, in 2011, following discussions concerning the inclusion of a new species, the demersal redfish, in the TAC covering redfish, the Commission took account of the allegations of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Estonia relating to the establishment of the TAC for demersal redfish. Next, the Commission, which has been planning to establish a TAC for sea bass since 2012, when faced with opposition from certain Member States including Ireland, stated that a TAC would be established for that species taking account of the historic catches of each Member State, in accordance with the principle of relative stability of fishing activities, and allowed the Member States to negotiate freely an agreement liable to suit each of them. Lastly, and continuing in its efforts to reach a consensus, the Commission has for several years encouraged the Kingdom of Spain and the Republic of Portugal to conclude an agreement on sardines, with a view to establishing a TAC that takes account of the principle of relative stability of fishing activities.</p>

          Regarding the principle of equal treatment, it should be borne in mind that, according to settled case-law, the second subparagraph of Article 40(2) TFEU, which prohibits all discrimination in the context of the common agricultural and fisheries policy, is merely a specific expression of the general principle of equal treatment, which requires that comparable situations must not be treated differently and different situations must not be treated alike unless such treatment is objectively justified (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 November 2013, SFIR and Others,
