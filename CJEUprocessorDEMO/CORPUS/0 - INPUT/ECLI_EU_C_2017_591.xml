Nevertheless, it is clear from the very wording of that provision, read in conjunction with Article 2(f) of Directive 2013/32, that that requirement applies only to the authority responsible for examining applications for international protection that is competent to take decisions at first instance in such cases, and does not therefore apply to appeal procedures.</p>

Article 31(8) of the directive allows Member States, in situations which that provision describes exhaustively, to provide that an examination procedure in accordance with the basic principles and guarantees of Chapter II of the directive may be accelerated or conducted at the border or in transit zones.

In order to comply with that provision, Member States are required, pursuant to Article 46(3) of the directive, to ensure that an effective remedy provides for a full and

However, neither Article 46 of Directive 2013/32 nor any other provision thereof provides that a hearing must be held before the court or tribunal hearing the appeal.

          However, according to the Court’s settled case-law, fundamental rights, such as respect for the rights of the defence, which includes the right to be heard, do not constitute unfettered prerogatives and may be restricted, provided that the restrictions in fact correspond to objectives of general interest pursued by the measure in question and that they do not entail, with regard to the objectives pursued, a disproportionate and intolerable interference which infringes upon the very substance of the rights guaranteed (see, to that effect, judgments of 10 September 2013, G. and R.,

          It follows, as the Advocate General observed in points 58, 59 and 65 to 67 of his Opinion, that whether it is necessary for the court or tribunal hearing the appeal provided for in Article 46 of Directive 2013/32 to grant the applicant a hearing has to be assessed in the light of its obligation to carry out the full and
          <span class="italic">ex nunc</span>
          examination required under Article 46(3) of the directive, in the interests of effective judicial protection of the rights and interests of the applicant. It is only if that court or tribunal considers that it is in a position to carry out such an examination solely on the basis of the information in the case-file, including, where applicable, the report or transcript of the personal interview with the applicant in the procedure at first instance, that it may decide not to hear the applicant in the appeal before it. In such circumstances, the possibility of not holding a hearing is in the interest of both the Member States and applicants, as referred to in recital 18 of Directive 2013/32, to have a decision made as soon as possible on applications for international protection, without prejudice to an adequate and complete examination being carried out.

          examination required, that hearing, as ordered by that court or tribunal, constitutes an essential procedural requirement, which cannot be dispensed with on grounds of speed, as referred to in recital 20 of Directive 2013/32. As the Advocate General observed in point 67 of his Opinion, although that recital allows Member States to accelerate the examination procedure in certain cases, inter alia where an application is likely to be unfounded, it does not authorise the elimination of procedures which are essential in order to guarantee the applicant’s right to effective judicial protection.
