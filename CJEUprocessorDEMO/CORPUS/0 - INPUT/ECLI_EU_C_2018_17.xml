          ). It notes that, in the case which gave rise to that judgment, the Danish legislation formed part of a policy for the integration of workers with disabilities and its aim was to encourage employers to hire employees with a particular risk of having to take sick leave repeatedly. That was not the situation in the case in the main proceedings, in which there was no legislative objective of integration of workers with disabilities. The referring court therefore considers that Article 52(d) of the Workers’ Statute is contrary to Directive 2000/78 and that this provision should, therefore, be amended in order to take account of disabilities.

          It should be noted that unfavourable treatment on grounds of disability does not run counter to the protection provided for by Directive 2000/78 unless it constitutes discrimination within the meaning of Article 2(1) of that directive. A worker with a disability covered by that directive must be protected against all discrimination in relation to a worker not so covered.

          On the question whether Article 52(d) of the Workers’ Statute is liable to entail a difference of treatment indirectly based on disability, it must be observed that taking account of days of absence because of illness linked to disability in the calculation of days of absence because of illness amounts to assimilating illness linked with disability to the general concept of illness. However, as stated by the Court in paragraph 44 of the judgment of 11 July 2006, Chacón Navas (

          It should be noted in that respect that a worker with a disability is, in principle, more exposed to the risk of being dismissed under Article 52(d) of the Workers’ Statute than a worker without a disability. Compared with such a worker, a worker with a disability has the additional risk of being absent by reason of an illness connected with his disability. He thus runs a greater risk of accumulating days of absence because of illness, and consequently of reaching the limits laid down in Article 52(d) of the Workers’ Statute. It is thus apparent that the rule in that provision is liable to place disabled workers at a disadvantage and so to bring about a difference of treatment indirectly based on disability within the meaning of Article 2(2)(b) of Directive 2000/78 (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 April 2013, HK Danmark,

That is why certain absences, such as those due to the illnesses described in the preceding paragraph of the present judgment, may not form the basis of a decision to dismiss on the ground of intermittent absences from work. During 2012, the Spanish legislature added absences for medical treatment for cancer or serious illness to the list of absences that may not constitute a ground for dismissal. Workers with disabilities generally fall within some of these cases, so that, in those cases, absences attributable to disability are not taken into account for the purposes of dismissal on the ground of intermittent absences from work.</p>
