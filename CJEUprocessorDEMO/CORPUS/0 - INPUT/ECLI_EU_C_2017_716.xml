In addition, Ferriere Nord makes the erroneous assumption that the decision at issue penalised a different infringement to that found in the 2002 decision. In fact, it is apparent from the content of the decision at issue that the infringement found consisted in a cartel covering the whole of the Italian market, that is to say a substantial part of the common market and, accordingly, a cartel prohibited by Article 65(1) CS.</p>

Similarly, contrary to the Commission’s assertion, Ferriere Nord’s argument regarding the lack of a hearing before the Hearing Officer is sufficiently precise to be admissible, since the appeal refers to both the provisions of EU law that in its opinion the General Court infringed in that regard and the paragraph of the judgment under appeal in which it considers that infringement to have been committed.</p>

After expiry of the ECSC Treaty, on 12 August 2002 the Commission sent the undertakings the supplementary statement of objections based on Article 19(1) of Regulation No 17, in which it explained its position regarding the change in the legal framework and invited them to make known their own points of view on the supplementary statement of objections.

Therefore, given that, as is clear from paragraph 43 of the present judgment, the statement of objections and the supplementary statement of objections were not affected by the annulment of the 2002 decision, it is necessary to assess whether the Commission gave the parties the opportunity to develop their arguments at an oral hearing conducted in accordance with the procedural requirements of Regulations No 1/2003 and 773/2004, as it was required to do.</p>

          ) — concerned the subject matter of the supplementary statement of objections, namely the legal consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty for the continuation of the proceedings. This is clear, first, from that statement, which expressly invited its addressees to make their point of view on those supplementary objections known. Second, the Commission stated, in paragraph 382 of the decision at issue, that it did not consider it necessary to repeat the oral hearing of 13 June 2002, in application of the provisions of Regulations No 17 and 1/2003, since that hearing, in which the Member State representatives did not participate, had been conducted in conformity with the rules of the ECSC Treaty, which was applicable at the time. Furthermore, at the joint hearing in Cases C‑85/15 P to C‑89/15 P, the Commission confirmed, in its reply to a question from the Court, that the supplementary statement of objections re-examined neither the facts nor the evidence forming the subject matter of the proceedings.
