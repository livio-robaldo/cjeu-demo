          On that certificate, the competent institution of the Member State in which an undertaking employing the workers concerned is established declares that its own social security system will remain applicable to those workers.

          It is also clear from the obligations to cooperate arising from Article 4(3) TEU that those obligations would not be fulfilled — and the aims of Article 14(2)(a) of Regulation No 1408/71 and Article 12a(1a) of Regulation No 574/72 would be thwarted — if the competent institution of the Member State in which the work is carried out were to consider that it was not bound by the E 101 certificate and made such workers subject to its own social security system (see, by analogy, judgment of 30 March 2000, Banks and Others,

          Consequently, in so far as an E 101 certificate establishes a presumption that the worker concerned is properly affiliated to the social security system of the Member State in which the undertaking employing him is established, it is binding on the competent institution of the Member State in which that person actually works (see, to that effect, judgment of 30 March 2000, Banks and Others,

          The opposite result would undermine the principle that employees are to be covered by only one social security system, would make it difficult to know which system is applicable and would consequently undermine legal certainty. In cases in which it was difficult to determine the system applicable, each of the competent institutions of the two Member States concerned would be inclined to take the view, to the detriment of the workers concerned, that its own social security system was applicable to those workers (judgment of 26 January 2006, Herbosch Kiere,

          Consequently, as long as an E 101 certificate is not withdrawn or declared invalid, the competent institution of the Member State in which an employee actually works must take account of the fact that that person is already subject to the social security legislation of the Member State in which the undertaking employing him is established, and that institution cannot therefore subject the worker in question to its own social security system (judgment of 30 March 2000, Banks and Others,

          In that context, the arguments relied on by the French Government and by the URSSAF as regards the ineffectiveness of that procedure and the need to prevent unfair competition and social dumping can in no way justify disregarding that procedure; nor,
