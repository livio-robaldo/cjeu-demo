In this context it has to be noted that the notions of public policy and public security also cover cases in which a third-country national belongs or has belonged to an association which supports terrorism, supports or has supported such an association, or has or has had extremist aspirations.</p>

          In this context, the significance of SUT’s involvement in the field of research for military purposes in Iran is said to be recognised in the international community. The defendant in the main proceedings observes in this respect that the nature of that involvement induced the EU legislature, by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1264/2012 of 21 December 2012 implementing Regulation (EU) No 267/2012 (

          ), originally to add that university to the list of entities subject to restrictive measures in Annex IX to Regulation No 267/2012. That listing was annulled by the General Court of the European Union, by its judgment of 3 July 2014, Sharif University of Technology v Council (

          ). The EU legislature added that university to that list once again by Implementing Regulation No 1202/2014. The defendant in the main proceedings notes that the reason for putting SUT back on the list was the proven close connection between it and the Iranian regime in the military or related fields.

          The Court has held that, according to recitals 6 and 7 of Directive 2004/114, the directive is intended to promote the mobility of students who are third country nationals to the European Union for the purpose of education, that mobility being intended to promote Europe as a world centre of excellence for studies and vocational training (judgment of 21 June 2012, Sommer,

          A Member State may not therefore, in relation to the admission of third country nationals for study purposes, introduce conditions additional to those laid down in Articles 6 and 7 of Directive 2004/114, as that would run counter to the objectives pursued by the directive (see, inter alia, judgment of 10 September 2014, Ben Alaya,
