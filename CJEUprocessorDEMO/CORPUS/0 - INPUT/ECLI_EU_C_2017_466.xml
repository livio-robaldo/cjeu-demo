Moreover, the appellants have at no time argued that, in so far as their action concerned Sanabel Relief Agency, it was brought by other natural or legal persons as its successors, or in particular by its founders and former directors, including Mr Abdrabbah and Mr Nasuf, the second and third appellants respectively (see, in particular, judgments of 20 October 1983, Gutmann v Commission,

          By their first ground of appeal, the appellants complain that the General Court misinterpreted the third plea they had put forward, alleging breach of the right to property and of the right to respect for private life. They claim that, in paragraphs 81 to 90 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected that plea on the basis of Article 44 of its Rules of Procedure, without examining the substance of the material they had produced. In so doing, the General Court failed to take into account their written observations and oral submissions and/or failed to apply the principles identified in the judgment of 14 April 2015, Ayadi v Commission (

They emphasise that they relied in that regard on a key fact, namely that, at the time of their re-listing, the United Kingdom — the Member State responsible for their inclusion on the lists of persons subject to fund-freezing measures — was of the view that they no longer satisfied the listing criteria. They make clear that they had indicated, in paragraph 94 of their application initiating the proceedings, that that material demonstrated that the Commission had failed to establish to any relevant standard of proof that they satisfied the criteria under Resolution 1617 (2005), and therefore that the interference with their rights was necessarily disproportionate.</p>

This ground of appeal does not, therefore, satisfy the formal requirements set out in Article 169(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice and should be rejected as manifestly inadmissible.

          It also states that the three very general arguments put forward by the appellants in support of their claim that the General Court took an irrational view of the facts are unfounded. First of all, the assertion that the ground set out in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal is unsubstantiated is untenable, the General Court having correctly found that the Commission had carried out a careful, independent and critical review of the appellants’ observations and of their entry on the list of persons subject to restrictive measures that was decided upon by the Sanctions Committee, and, moreover, that it had not automatically reproduced that committee’s conclusions. Next, in the Commission’s submission, the appellants’ arguments that the grounds set out in paragraphs 66 to 70 of the judgment under appeal are incompatible with the judgments of 18 July 2013, Commission and Others v Kadi (

          ) are unfounded, since the question as to whether there is an infringement of the rights of the defence and of the right to effective judicial protection must be examined in relation to the specific circumstances of each particular case. Lastly, the argument that paragraphs 66 to 70 of the judgment under appeal are vitiated by an error of law because no approach was made to the United Kingdom at all, at any time, is unfounded. It does not follow from that case-law that the Commission is obliged to approach the United Kingdom. In any event, the Commission had consulted the EU Committee for the review of listings, on which all the Member States are represented.

Accordingly, it held, in paragraph 71 of its judgment, that the appellants’ first plea in law had to be rejected.
