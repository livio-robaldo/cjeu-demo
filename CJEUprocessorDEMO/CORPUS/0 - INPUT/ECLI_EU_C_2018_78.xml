        <p class="normal">The referring court observes that, according to national case-law, where several syndicates of Lloyd’s participate in the same call for tenders, the fact that the applications to participate in the tender and the financial tenders of those syndicates are signed by Lloyd’s General Representative for Italy entails no infringement either of Article 38(1)(m), quater, and (2) of Legislative Decree No 163/2006, or of the principles of competition, independence and the confidentiality of tenders. That case-law has, in this regard, highlighted the particular structure of Lloyd’s which, in accordance with United Kingdom rules and regulations, operates in different countries through a single General Representative. Likewise, in its Opinion No 110 of 9 April 2008, the Autorità di Vigilanza sui Contratti Pubblici (Supervisory Authority for Public Contracts, Italy), which has since become the Autorità Nazionale Anticorruzione (National Anti-Corruption Agency, Italy), stated that the independence of syndicates and competition between them serve to ensure free competition and the equal treatment of candidates.</p>

        <p class="normal">The referring court is uncertain, however, as to whether the Italian legislation at issue, as interpreted by national case-law, complies with EU law. Admittedly, Directive 2009/138 recognises Lloyd’s as a particular form of insurance undertaking, the members of which are authorised to operate within the European Union through the intermediary of a single General Representative for the Member State concerned. However, even if the syndicates of Lloyd’s operate independently of one another and in competition with one another, the fact remains that tendering procedures are governed by mandatory rules intended to ensure observance of equal treatment. It is certain that, when Lloyd’s General Representative signs tenders submitted by syndicates, he is aware of their content. Consequently, the fact that the same person signs several tenders submitted by different tenderers may undermine the independence and confidentiality of those tenders and, as a result, infringe the principle of competition laid down, in particular, in Articles 101 and 102 TFEU.</p>

          In this case, the main proceedings concern a public service contract for insurance, in respect of which it is not specified whether the value reaches the threshold set by Directive 2004/18. It should be noted, however, that the award of contracts which, in view of their value, do not fall within the scope of that directive is nonetheless subject to the fundamental rules and the general principles of the FEU Treaty, in particular the principles of equal treatment and of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality and the consequent obligation of transparency, provided that those contracts have certain cross-border interest in the light of certain objective criteria (judgment of 16 April 2015, Enterprise Focused Solutions,

          In this regard, it should be stated at the outset that, while Directive 2004/18 was repealed by Directive 2014/24 with effect from 18 April 2016, it is apparent from settled case-law of the Court that the applicable directive is, as a rule, the one in force when the contracting authority chooses the type of procedure to be followed and decides definitively whether it is necessary for a prior call for competition to be issued for the award of a public contract. Conversely, a directive is not applicable if the period prescribed for its transposition expired after that point in time (see, inter alia, judgment of 14 September 2017, Casertana Costruzioni,

          It should be pointed out in this regard that the Court has already held that groups of undertakings can have different forms and objectives, which do not necessarily preclude controlled undertakings from enjoying a certain autonomy in the conduct of their commercial policy and their economic activities, inter alia, in the area of their participation in the award of public contracts. Relationships between undertakings in the same group may in fact be governed by specific provisions such as to guarantee both independence and confidentiality in the drawing-up of tenders which may be submitted simultaneously by the undertakings in question in the same tendering procedure (judgment of 19 May 2009, Assitur,

          Observance of the principle of proportionality therefore requires that the contracting authority be required to examine and assess the facts, in order to determine whether the relationship between two entities has actually influenced the respective content of the tenders submitted in the same tendering procedure, a finding of such influence, in any form, being sufficient for those undertakings to be excluded from the procedure (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 May 2009, Assitur,

          The distinction made in that regard by Arpacal in its written observations, dependent on whether the signature relates to the candidates’ applications to participate in the tender procedures or to the financial tenders themselves, is irrelevant.
