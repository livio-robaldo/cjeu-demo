          The referring court is uncertain as to whether Article 1(6) and Article 7(1) of the law on civil liability and motor vehicle insurance, read together with Article 2 of the compulsory insurance regulation, are compatible with Article 3 of Directive 2009/103, since the effect of those provisions of national law is that, in a certain number of situations, such as those that are the subject matter of the proceedings before it, liability arising from the use of motor vehicles does not compulsorily have to be covered by insurance. The referring court considers that the only exceptions to compulsory insurance are those listed in Article 5 of that directive. Further, that court notes that, in the judgment of 4 September 2014, Vnuk (

          In that regard, it should be borne in mind that, according to the Court’s settled case-law, questions on the interpretation of EU law referred by a national court in the factual and legislative context which that court is responsible for defining and the accuracy of which is not a matter for the Court to determine enjoy a presumption of relevance. The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred for a preliminary ruling by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgment of 20 July 2017, Piscarreta Ricardo,
