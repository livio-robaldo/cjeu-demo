        <p class="normal">In essence, it is apparent from the contested decision that the original agreement, concluded during 1969 between the top five producers of AFP at the time, was intended to resolve a situation of overcapacity in the European market. The constituent arrangements of the cartel were named ‘CEPA’ (Centre d’étude des phosphates alimentaires — Centre for the Study of feed phosphates). In order to ensure the functioning and the permanence of the cartel, the agreement is alleged to have resulted in additional specific agreements and other regional sub-arrangements. The participation of the French producers in CEPA was confirmed as from 1970. After a reorganisation, by the cartel participants, into three sub-arrangements, those participants contemplated, at the beginning of the 1990s, a return to a single structure, the ‘Super CEPA’, encompassing, first, the undertakings located in the five countries of Central Europe, namely Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Switzerland and, secondly, Denmark, Ireland, Hungary, Poland, Finland, Sweden, the UK and Norway. The discussions are alleged to have been held at two levels: the ‘central meetings’ or meetings ‘at European level’, during which general policy decisions were taken, and ‘expert meetings’, during which more in-depth discussions were allegedly held at national or regional level by the participants in the cartel which were active in a country or region.</p>

        <p class="normal">In that third limb, the appellants state that the General Court relied on internal memoranda of the minutes of three bilateral meetings which took place between them and the Commission during 2009. In particular, the General Court relied on the second internal memorandum stating that they had made ‘admissions’ concerning their alleged participation in the infringement for the period from 1978 to 1992. One of those internal memoranda was communicated only after the written procedure had been closed and in breach of the principle of adversarial proceedings. It is settled case-law, it is claimed, that failure to communicate a document during the administrative procedure constitutes an infringement of the rights of the defence, since the Commission relied on that document to substantiate its complaint relating to the existence of an infringement and that that complaint could only be proved by reference to that document, as occurred in the present case. According to the appellants, even if the Commission could rely on those internal memoranda, the General Court, in so far as it did not verify compliance with the standard of proof, infringed the rights of the defence.</p>

Consequently, and without changing the position of the undertaking, which is possible at any time, the Commission is justified in considering that an application for leniency implies, on the part of the undertaking concerned, acknowledgment of its participation in the alleged infringement, whether that acknowledgment is characterised as an ‘admission’ or another term. Such a finding does not, it is contended, constitute an infringement of the right not to incriminate oneself, since the self-incriminatory statements are, in the present case, voluntary.</p>

        <p class="normal">In that context, the Commission considers that the appellants’ argument, relied on in the context of that first limb, arises from confusion between the settlement procedure and that relating to an application for leniency. Indeed, the evidence on which it relied to consider that Timab had participated in the infringement before 1993 was not based on an alleged acknowledgment under the settlement, but was based on statements made within the framework of the application for leniency. It is on that basis that, in the absence of contradiction, the Commission conducted the discussions in order to reach a settlement. It was, therefore, without infringing the rights of the defence that the Commission, in the course of the settlement procedure, and then the General Court, in paragraph 94 of the judgment under appeal, were able to treat Timab’s statements in the period between 1978 and 1993 as ‘admissions’, in so far as those statements had not been the subject of any further clarification.</p>

          Concerning the first limb of the second ground of appeal, it should be recalled, as the General Court did in paragraph 120 of the judgment under appeal, that, according to settled case-law, the Commission is entitled to compel an undertaking to provide all necessary information concerning such facts as may be known to it but may not compel that undertaking to provide it with answers which might involve an admission on its part of the existence of an infringement which it is incumbent upon the Commission to prove (see judgment of 14 July 2005, ThyssenKrupp v Commission,

          However, as the General Court has also held in the abovementioned paragraph 120 of the judgment under appeal, while the Commission cannot compel an undertaking to admit its participation in an infringement, it is not thereby prevented from taking account, when setting the amount of the fine, of the assistance given by that undertaking, of its own volition, in order to establish the existence of the infringement (see judgment of 14 July 2005 in ThyssenKrupp v Commission,

          The Court has already had occasion to state that the Commission may, for the purpose of fixing the amount of a fine, take account of the assistance given to it by the undertaking concerned to establish the existence of the infringement with less difficulty and, in particular, of the fact that an undertaking admitted its participation in the infringement (see judgment of 14 July 2005, ThyssenKrupp v Commission,

          It follows that, in order to establish an infringement of the right not to give self-incriminating evidence, it is necessary for the undertaking concerned to be effectively compelled to provide information or evidence capable of proving the infringement (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 October 2002, Limburgse Vinyl Maatschappij and Others v Commission,

According to the appellants, no new facts were added to the case file after that withdrawal. The only new element, if any, it is claimed, was a closer examination of the facts by the Commission, which led it to acknowledge that the appellants had not participated in the infringement at issue since 1978, whereas it should have arrived at this finding as early as the settlement stage.</p>

It adds that the appellants misrepresent the position of the General Court in their statements regarding the judgment under appeal. According to that institution, the new element referred to by the General Court in paragraph 90 of the judgment under appeal is not the new analysis of the situation which it carried out on its own initiative, but the different light shed by Timab, for the first time in reply to the statement of objections, the specific purpose of the latter being to give undertakings the opportunity to state their views in order to ensure compliance with the adversarial principle in the ordinary procedure.</p>

Moreover, according to the Commission, the revision of that fine could have been anticipated by the appellants, since the amount imposed resulted from a strict application of the relevant calculation rules in the light of the factors which existed on the date when that decision was taken.

          As regards, in the first place, the argument according to which the General Court infringed the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations, it should be noted that, according to settled case-law, the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations is among the fundamental principles of EU law and any economic operator whom an institution has, by giving him precise insurances, caused to entertain justified expectations may rely on that principle (judgment of 24 October 2013, Kone and Others v Commission,

          Furthermore, the Court has already had occasion to explain that the Commission cannot, in the procedural stage preceding the adoption of the final decision, give any precise assurance as to any reduction of, or immunity from, fines and that the participants in the cartel cannot therefore entertain a legitimate expectation in that regard (see judgment of 24 October 2013, Kone and Others v Commission,

In their view, the General Court erred in law, in paragraph 125 of the judgment under appeal, in the way it conveyed the content of the exchanges which took place at the hearing on 24 February 2010. At that hearing, the Commission stated that it would take account, not in the context of Timab’s ‘cooperation’, as set out in the judgment under appeal in that paragraph, but in the context of ‘leniency’, the fact that the appellants had not joined the cartel before 1993. According to the appellants, while the concept of ‘cooperation’ covers the periods covered by both the leniency notice and those not covered by that notice, the concept of ‘leniency’ refers, in the present case, only to the reduction of 17% of the fine imposed. Thus, the Commission never explicitly mentioned, in the course of the standard procedure, the elimination of the reduction of 35% in the fine for cooperation outside the scope of the leniency notice.</p>

In paragraph 125 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court, as the Advocate General pointed out in point 60 of his Opinion, simply refers to the Commission’s warning to the appellants, in the course of the standard proceedings, regarding that change in position, and not as a consequence of their withdrawal from the settlement procedure, as they allege.</p>

          It should be recalled, first, that the General Court has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and, in principle, to examine the evidence it accepts in support of those facts. Provided that the evidence has been properly obtained and the general principles of law and the rules of procedure in relation to the burden of proof and the taking of evidence have been observed, it is for the General Court alone to assess the value which should be attached to the evidence produced to it.

          Secondly, it should be noted that an appeal is inadmissible in so far as it merely repeats the pleas in law and arguments previously submitted to the General Court, including those based on facts expressly rejected by it. Such an appeal amounts in reality to no more than a request for re-examination of the application submitted to the General Court, which the Court of Justice does not have jurisdiction to undertake on appeal (judgment of 30 May 2013, Quinn Barlo and Others v Commission,

          By contrast, provided that the appellant challenges the interpretation or application of EU law by the General Court, the points of law examined at first instance may be discussed again in the course of an appeal.

          As regards, more particularly, the argument put forward by the appellants that the General Court did not carry out an in-depth review of the gravity rate applied when setting the basic amount of the fine, or of the refusal to grant mitigating circumstances in respect of Timab’s competitive behaviour, it suffices to note that, in paragraphs 149 to 164 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court gave a detailed account of the factors which it took into account in assessing the gravity of the infringement. In the same way, it is clear from paragraphs 165 to 168 of the judgment under appeal that the General Court carefully considered the question of mitigating circumstances. Accordingly, that argument must be held to be unfounded. The mere fact that the General Court confirmed, in that regard, in the exercise of its unlimited jurisdiction, a number of factors from the assessment made by the Commission in the contested decision cannot call that conclusion into question (see, judgment of 8 May 2013, Eni v Commission,

          It should be recalled that the sanction for a breach, by a Court of the European Union, of its obligation under the second paragraph of Article 47 of the Charter to adjudicate on the cases before it within a reasonable time must be an action for damages brought before the General Court, since such an action constitutes an effective remedy. It follows that a claim for compensation in respect of the damage caused by the General Court’s failure to adjudicate within a reasonable period may not be made directly to the Court of Justice in the context of an appeal, but must be brought before the General Court itself (judgments of 30 April 2014, FLSmidth v Commission,

          As regards the criteria for assessing whether the General Court has observed the reasonable time principle, it must be borne in mind that the reasonableness of the period for delivering judgment is to be appraised in the light of the circumstances specific to each case, such as the complexity of the case and the conduct of the parties (judgment of 26 November 2013, Groupe Gascogne v Commission,

          The Court has held in that regard that the list of relevant criteria is not exhaustive and that the assessment of the reasonableness of a period does not require a systematic examination of the circumstances of the case in the light of each of them, where the duration of the proceedings appears justified in the light of one of them. Thus, the complexity of the case or the dilatory conduct of the appellant may be deemed to justify a duration which is prima facie too long (judgment of 26 November 2013, Groupe Gascogne v Commission,
