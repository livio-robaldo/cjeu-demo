          mutagenesis methods were used for several decades without creating identified risks for the environment or health. By contrast, since the adoption of Directive 2001/18, new varieties, in particular those resistant to herbicides, have been obtained through random mutagenesis techniques applied
          <span class="italic">in vitro</span>
          to plant cells and through directed mutagenesis techniques/methods applying new genetic engineering techniques, such as oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis or directed nuclease mutagenesis. It is, in the view of the referring court, impossible to determine with certainty the existence and extent of the risks presented by those new herbicide-resistant varieties for the environment and human and animal health, the only risk assessments thus far being carried out in the context of the marketing authorisation procedure for the plant protection products to which those varieties have been made resistant.

As regards, in particular, the mutations obtained by the new directed mutagenesis techniques, the direct modification of the genome that they involve would result in the same effects as the introduction of a foreign gene, specific to transgenesis. In addition, since the development of the new techniques of mutagenesis allows the production of modifications of the genetic heritage to increase at a rate out of all proportion to the modifications likely to occur naturally or randomly, the possibility of harm occurring as a result of unintentional modifications of the genome or of the properties of the plant thus obtained would be increased.</p>

It follows that an interpretation of the exemption in Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/18, read in conjunction with point 1 of Annex I B thereto, which excludes organisms obtained by means of techniques/methods of mutagenesis from the scope of that directive, without any distinctions, would compromise the objective of protection pursued by the directive and would fail to respect the precautionary principle which it seeks to implement.</p>
