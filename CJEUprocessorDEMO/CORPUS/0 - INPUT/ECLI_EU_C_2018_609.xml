Thus, hearses do not have a single enclosed space comprising an area for the driver and passengers and another area that may be used for the transport of both persons and goods, since, on the contrary, a fixed and hermetic barrier is installed, which is necessary for hygienic and sanitary reasons, separating the driver’s cab from the rear area.</p>
