                The introduction of the proceeds of illegal activities into the financial system and their investment after laundering are detrimental to sound and sustainable economic development. Accordingly, Council Directive 91/308/EEC of 10 June 1991 on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering [
                <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1991:166:TOC" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab">OJ 1991 L 166, p. 77</a>
                ] introduced a Community mechanism to prevent money laundering by monitoring transactions through credit and financial institutions and certain types of professions. As there is a risk that the application of that mechanism will lead to an increase in cash movements for illicit purposes, Directive 91/308 … should be supplemented by a control system on cash entering or leaving the Community.
