In a reasoned opinion of 19 July 2007, the European Commission, in essence, found that that legislation, by allowing only operators which were already broadcasting in analogue mode to have access to the digital radio and television market, shielded them from competition on that market. The Italian Government adopted a number measures in order to make that legislation compatible with EU law.</p>

In addition, it was stipulated that each operator already active on the analogue market was to be assigned at least one multiplex. On that basis, three multiplexes were assigned to single network operators. Five multiplexes were allocated among the multi-network operators. In that way, Radiotelevisione italiana SpA (RAI) and Mediaset, which each ran three analogue channels, were assigned two multiplexes, while Telecom Italia Media Broadcasting, which ran two analogue channels, received one multiplex.</p>

The questions concern the issue whether analogue channels which were allegedly operated irregularly may be taken into account in the same way as regularly operated channels for the purposes of their conversion into digital networks. As the Advocate General stated in points 37 to 40 of her Opinion, the Court is in a position to provide a useful answer to the referring court on the basis of the information in the file sent by that court, and by starting from the factual premiss, which only that court may, as appropriate, cast doubt upon, that analogue channels were operated irregularly or unlawfully in the light of national law and/or the provisions of the NCRF.</p>

          In the second place, in order to provide the referring court with a useful answer and in the event that that court finds that all the channels have been lawfully operated, it should be recalled that the general principle of equal treatment, as a general principle of EU law, requires that comparable situations must not be treated differently and different situations must not be treated in the same way, unless such treatment is objectively justified (see judgment of 16 December 2008, Arcelor Atlantique et Lorraine and Others,

        <p class="normal">Secondly, it is clear from the information submitted to the Court that the analogue channels operated by those multi-network operators were converted into digital networks in accordance with the so-called ‘fair’ conversion criterion referred to in paragraph 16 above. Thus, it is apparent from the order for reference that the number of channels operated by each operator was converted into as many digital networks after subtracting one channel. Consequently, Persidera, which operated two analogue channels, was assigned one digital network, while RAI and Mediaset, which each operated three analogue channels, received two digital networks apiece. In other words, whereas the conversion rate applied to both Rai and Mediaset was 66.67%, each of them having been awarded two digital networks for their three analogue channels, the conversion rate applied to Persidera was only 50%, since it was awarded only one digital network for its two analogue channels. The application of the same measure of removing an analogue channel during the digital conversion thus resulted in the application of different conversion rates which affected Persidera more than RAI and Mediaset.</p>

As the Advocate General stated in point 67 of her Opinion and subject to verification by the referring court, it thus appears that a single multiplex may have been sufficient to enable operators such as RAI and Mediaset to ensure the continuity of their three analogue channels with a comparable quality, and that the assignment of a second multiplex went beyond what was necessary for that purpose. In addition, as is apparent from point 79 of the Opinion, preserving the indivisibility of radio frequencies does not appear to justify sufficiently the difference in treatment at issue in the main proceedings, that being a matter for the referring court to determine.</p>
