Consequently, the taking-on of the former undertaking’s employees does not reflect the situation in which members of staff are transferred because the new contracting company voluntarily takes on the majority of the employees who provided the services in question. On the contrary, in those cases, the transfer of staff is the result of compliance with the provisions laid down in the applicable collective agreement.

The relationship between Article 44 of the Workers’ Statute and Article 14 of the collective agreement for security firms is one of supplementation or of peaceful coexistence, in that the rules of the collective agreement, governing a different situation, improves the situation by applying one of the effects laid down in the statutory provision for its own scope of application.

          The Court has previously stated that an economic entity is able, in certain sectors, to function without any significant tangible or intangible assets, and therefore the maintenance of the identity of such an entity following the transaction affecting it cannot, logically, depend on the transfer of such assets (judgment of 20 January 2011, CLECE,

          The Court has thus held that, inasmuch as, in certain labour-intensive sectors, a group of workers engaged in a joint activity on a permanent basis may constitute an economic entity, such an entity is capable of maintaining its identity after it has been transferred where the new employer does not merely pursue the activity in question but also takes over a major part, in terms of their numbers and skills, of the employees specially assigned by his predecessor to that task. In those circumstances, the new employer takes over an organised body of assets enabling him to carry on the activities or certain activities of the transferor undertaking on a regular basis (judgment of 20 January 2011, CLECE,
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2011%3A24&amp;locale=en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch" hreflang="en" class="CourtLink">C‑463/09</a>

          Thus, a business providing security in a museum, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which does not require specific tangible assets, can be regarded as essentially a labour-intensive activity and, consequently, a group of workers engaged in a joint security activity on a permanent basis may, in the absence of other factors of production, constitute an economic entity. The identity of that entity must nonetheless be retained after the transfer in question (see, by analogy, judgment of 20 January 2011, CLECE,

          Furthermore, although the Spanish Government submits in its written observations that the engagement of the staff of Esabe Vigilancia was imposed on VINSA by a collective agreement, that circumstance, in any event, has no bearing on the fact that the transfer concerns an economic entity. It must, moreover, be emphasised that the objective pursued by the collective agreement for security firms is the same as that pursued by Directive 2001/23 and that that collective agreement is expressly intended, as regards the engagement of part of the staff, to cover the case of a new tendering procedure such as that at issue in the main proceedings (see, to that effect, judgment of 24 January 2002, Temco,
