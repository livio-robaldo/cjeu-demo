It maintained that it was the subject of discrimination, since, in the regulation at issue, the Commission had laid down transitional measures and derogating rules specific to organic aquacultures other than its own. That regulation, it argued, thus operated to the advantage of its competitors but did not lay down any transitional and derogating measure from which it could itself benefit. According to Binca, such transitional and derogating measures concerned in particular the origin of juvenile animals.</p>

Given that the regulation at issue did not amend that transitional period, the General Court took the view, in the order under appeal, that annulment of the implementing regulation would not alter the applicable legal framework. Without examining the other conditions governing admissibility of the action, the General Court accordingly held, in paragraph 73 of the order under appeal, that Binca did not have an interest in bringing proceedings for annulment of the regulation at issue and that, consequently, its action was inadmissible.</p>

          It must be borne in mind that, according to the settled case-law of the Court of Justice, an action for annulment brought by a natural or legal person is admissible only in so far as that person has an interest in having the contested act annulled. Such an interest requires that the annulment of that act must be capable, in itself, of having legal consequences and that the action may therefore, through its outcome, procure an advantage to the party which brought it (judgments of 4 June 2015, Andechser Molkerei Scheitz v Commission,

In that application, Binca stated, in relation to the origin of juvenile animals, that the amendment of Article 25e(4) of the implementing regulation by Article 1(1) of the regulation at issue led to unequal treatment between aquaculture carried out in the Mekong Delta and that carried out in brackish water zones in Europe.</p>

It is indeed clear from the provisions of Article 21 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and Article 44(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court of 2 May 1991 (now Article 76 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court of 23 April 2015) that the application submitted at first instance must contain, inter alia, the subject matter of the dispute and a brief statement of the pleas in law relied on.</p>

        <p class="normal">Nevertheless, in the first place, as follows from paragraphs 25 and 26 of the present judgment, Binca’s role in the supply chain of organic pangasius from Vietnam is wider and more complex than that of a traditional importer. In any event, given that the requirements relating to organic labelling to which importers of organic aquaculture products are subject include the production requirements imposed by the regulation at issue, a fact which the Commission acknowledged during the hearing before the Court, it cannot be held, in the present case, that fish producers alone are liable to have an interest in the annulment of the regulation at issue.</p>

The annulment requested by Binca would thus eliminate those exceptions and make it harder, or even impossible, to produce certain types of fish organically, within the meaning of the basic regulation, the implementing regulation and the regulations amending the implementing regulation.</p>
