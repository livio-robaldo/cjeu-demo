Consequently, the factors which characterise those two situations, and the question whether the situations are comparable, must be determined and assessed in the light of the objectives pursued by the legislature when it permitted the Member States to apply a reduced rate of VAT to the supply of digital books on all physical means of support.</p>

          In that regard, it should be pointed out that the power of the Member States to apply a reduced rate of VAT to the supply of printed books was laid down for the first time by Council Directive 92/77/EEC of 19 October 1992 supplementing the common system of value added tax and amending Directive 77/388/EEC (approximation of VAT rates) (

          ). Article 1 of that directive inserted into the Sixth Directive Annex H relating to the list of supplies of goods and services which may be subject to reduced rates of VAT, point 6 of which was reproduced in point 6 of Annex III to Directive 2006/112, in the version before Directive 2009/47 entered into force. That power was extended by Directive 2009/47 to the supply of books on ‘all physical means of support’.

        <p class="normal">It is apparent from the preparatory documents for Directive 2002/38 that the amendments proposed by the Commission constituted, as regards the taxation of electronically supplied services, a first step in implementing a new policy on VAT, intended to simplify and strengthen the VAT system in order to encourage legitimate commercial transactions within the internal market. Indeed, according to the preparatory documents, e-commerce offers considerable potential for creating wealth and employment in the European Union, and the provision of a clear and definite regulatory environment is an essential prerequisite for creating the climate of confidence in which business will invest and trade.</p>

Indeed, it is apparent from their explanations that it was considered necessary to make electronically supplied services subject to clear, simple and uniform rules in order that the VAT rate applicable to those services may be established with certainty and, thus, that the administration of VAT by taxable persons and national tax authorities is facilitated.</p>
