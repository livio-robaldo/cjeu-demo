It notes, however, that the refusal to extend legal aid to cover the costs of translation of those documents, assuming that this constitutes a restriction on the effective access to justice, pursues a legitimate objective, namely to relieve the public purse of the Member State of the court hearing the case of costs which should instead be borne by the Member State in which the applicant is domiciled or habitually resident.</p>

        <p class="normal">In that context, the clarification set out in the final part of Article 8(b) of Directive 2003/8 must be interpreted as meaning that it does not give rise to a condition which must be satisfied in every case by the legal aid applicant in order for him to be entitled to have those costs covered, but rather that provision is limited to highlighting the possibility that the recipient may have those costs covered in the State in which he is domiciled or habitually resident, without, however, excluding such a coverage of the costs when, as in the dispute in the main proceedings, the application is submitted in the Member State of the court hearing the case.</p>

        <p class="normal">In other words, as the Advocate General has noted, essentially, in point 53 of his Opinion, Article 8(b) of Directive 2003/8 must be understood as meaning that it provides, as an exception to the general rule requiring that the Member State of the court hearing the case should cover the costs connected to the cross-border nature of a dispute, for the coverage by the Member State of the domicile or habitual residence of the costs of translation of the legal aid application and of the supporting documents necessary for the processing of that application.</p>

        <p class="normal">In the third place, it must be held that exclusion of the coverage by the Member State of the court hearing the case of the costs connected to the translation of the supporting documents necessary for processing a legal aid application would run counter to the objectives pursued by Directive 2003/8, as referred to in paragraphs 25 to 27 above, concerning effective access to justice in cross-border disputes, given that it would penalise the legal aid applicant in the situation where he decides to submit his aid application directly to the receiving authority.</p>

        <p class="normal">Furthermore, as the Advocate General has noted in point 46 of his Opinion, such an exclusion would be likely to lead to a more onerous procedural solution for the legal aid applicant. Instead of submitting his legal aid application directly to the court with jurisdiction to hear the substantive dispute, that applicant would be obliged to open two separate sets of proceedings, the first being before the competent court of the Member State of the court hearing the case in order to ensure compliance with time limits, and the second being before the authorities in the Member State in which he is domiciled or habitually resident in order to obtain reimbursement of the costs incurred in connection with the legal aid application.</p>
