                In recent years more investors have become active in the financial markets and are offered an even more complex wide-ranging set of services and instruments. In view of these developments the legal framework of the Community should encompass the full range of investor-oriented activities. To this end, it is necessary to provide for the degree of harmonisation needed to offer investors a high level of protection and to allow investment firms to provide services throughout the Community, being a Single Market, on the basis of home country supervision. In view of the preceding, [Council Directive 93/22/EEC of 10 May 1993 on investment services in the securities field (
                <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1993:141:TOC" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab">OJ 1993 L 141, p. 27</a>
