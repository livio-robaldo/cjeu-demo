The principles developed by the Court in that judgment could, therefore, be applied to a case such as that in question in the main proceedings. Secondly, the Upper Tribunal noted that a differently constituted chamber of that tribunal had already held that a person who had been refused a residence card as an ‘extended family member’ had no right of appeal under the 2006 Regulations.

          That consideration is based upon settled case-law, according to which, in essence, if no such derived right of residence were granted to such a third-country national, a Union citizen would be discouraged from leaving the Member State of which he is a national in order to exercise his right of residence under Article 21(1) TFEU in another Member State because he is uncertain whether he will be able to continue in his Member State of origin a family life which has been created or strengthened, with that third-country national, in the host Member State, during a genuine residence (see, to that effect, judgments of 12 March 2014, O. and B.,

Those safeguards include the obligation for the competent national authorities to undertake an extensive examination of the applicant’s personal circumstances and to justify any denial of entry or residence.</span>
