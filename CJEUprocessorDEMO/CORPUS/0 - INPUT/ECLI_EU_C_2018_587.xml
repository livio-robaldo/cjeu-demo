Subsequently, each year, it was for the Minister for Energy to set, before 31 December, the rate of tax per kilowatt hour consumed so that the revenue from that tax would cover all the costs intended to be offset. In addition, the revenue raised from the CSPE was not integrated into the State budget, but was rather deposited in a special account of the Equalisation Fund, intended solely to offset the expenditure incurred in the implementation of the public service tasks assigned to electricity operators, referred to in Article 5 of Law No 2000-108, as amended by Law No 2003-8.</p>

It is sufficient that the indirect taxes pursuing specific objectives should, on those points, accord with the general scheme of one or other of those taxation techniques as structured by EU legislation (judgment of 24 February 2000, Commission v France,
