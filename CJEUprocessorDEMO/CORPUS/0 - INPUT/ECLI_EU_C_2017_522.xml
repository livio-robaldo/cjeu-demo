According to Glencore, the investigation procedure at issue in the main proceedings took more than two years for reasons which were not connected with the late disclosure of the documents requested, but principally with the actions of the tax authority. In addition, the tax authority compelled Glencore to disclose to it a large quantity of data within the first two weeks of that investigation procedure and, upon each request, gave it only three working days in which to disclose the data. According to Glencore, the tax authority should have refunded the VAT claimed within the 45 day period laid down in Article 37 of the Code of fiscal procedure for claims exceeding HUF 500000 (approximately EUR 1600). Failing such a refund, that authority was required to pay it default interest. The principle of fiscal neutrality requires that a taxable person may obtain a refund of overpaid VAT within a reasonable period and that the time of that refund cannot be influenced by procedural acts of a tax authority.</p>

        <p class="normal">The referring court notes that the Court has previously held that the principle of neutrality precludes Member States from making refunds of overpaid VAT subject to conditions which impose an additional burden on taxable persons by affecting their financial situation, that the Member States must ensure that a refund is made within a reasonable period of time and that the conditions governing the refund do not themselves give rise to any financial risk for the taxable person. According to the referring court, the Court has also held that taxable persons who were refunded overpaid VAT after a period which could not be described as reasonable are entitled to default interest and that it is for the legal order of each Member State to lay down the conditions under which such interest must be paid, whilst adhering to the principles of equivalence and effectiveness.</p>

        <p class="normal">However, the referring court takes the view that the Court’s case-law does not contain sufficiently clear indications, in particular, as to the consequences of fines imposed by a tax authority, such as that at issue in the main proceedings. It considers that to refund Glencore the overpaid VAT within an approximately two-year period, rather than within the normal period of 45 days, infringes the principle of proportionality and, consequently, that Glencore’s claim for default interest must be upheld. The referring court also considers that the fact that the tax authority, by an abusive literal interpretation of the relevant national law, may, by imposing a fine on a taxable person for non-compliance with a duty of disclosure, continue tax investigations without any time limit and without being required to pay default interest amounts to an infringement of that principle.</p>

          The Court has thus held that the conditions for the refund of overpaid VAT laid down by a Member State must not undermine the principle of fiscal neutrality by making the taxable person bear the burden of the VAT in whole or in part. In particular, such conditions must enable the taxable person, in appropriate circumstances, to recover the entirety of the credit arising from that overpayment of VAT. This implies that the refund be made within a reasonable period of time and that, in any event, the method of refund adopted must not entail any financial risk for the taxable person (judgments of 12 May 2011, Enel Maritsa Iztok 3,

          In accordance with equally settled case-law, being called upon, within the exercise of its jurisdiction, to apply provisions of EU law, a national court must give full effect to those provisions, if necessary refusing of its own motion to apply any conflicting provision of national law, and it is not necessary for that court to request or to await the prior setting aside of that provision of national law by legislative or other constitutional means (judgment of 5 July 2016, Ognyanov,
