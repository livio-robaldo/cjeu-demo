          Consequently, in so far as an E 101 certificate establishes a presumption that the worker concerned is properly registered with the social security system of the Member State in which the undertaking employing him is established, it is binding on the competent institution of the Member State in which that person actually works (see, to that effect, judgment of 27 April 2017, A-Rosa Flussschiff,

          Therefore, for as long as an E 101 certificate is not withdrawn or declared invalid, the competent institution of the Member State in which an employee actually works must take account of the fact that that person is already subject to the social security legislation of the Member State in which the undertaking employing him is established, and that institution cannot therefore subject the worker in question to its own social security system (judgment of 27 April 2017, A-Rosa Flussschiff,

          It should, however, be noted that it follows from the principle of sincere cooperation that any institution of a Member State must carry out a diligent examination of the application of its own social security system.

          As a result, it is incumbent on the competent institution of the Member State which issued the E 101 certificate to reconsider the grounds for its issue and, if appropriate, to withdraw the certificate if the competent institution of the Member State in which the employee actually works expresses doubts as to the accuracy of the facts on which the certificate is based and, consequently, of the information contained therein, in particular because that information does not meet the requirements of Article 14(1)(a) of Regulation No 1408/71 (see, to that effect, judgment of 27 April 2017, A-Rosa Flussschiff,
