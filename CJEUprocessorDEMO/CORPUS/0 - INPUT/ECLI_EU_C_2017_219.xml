Whether it is applied concurrently to or subsequent to the bankruptcy proceedings, the bankruptcy discharge procedure thus presupposes that the debtor’s property has been liquidated in full and the division of the assets resulting from that liquidation between the creditors has not enabled all the debts to be settled. Furthermore, discharge from bankruptcy is not granted, under the second paragraph of Article 142 of the Law on insolvency and bankruptcy, unless the creditors in the bankruptcy proceedings have been at least satisfied in part.</p>

It is apparent, inter alia, from those conditions that the debtor, on one hand, cannot have benefited already from such a procedure in the ten years preceding the request, cannot have been found guilty of fraudulent bankruptcy, an economic offence or an offence committed in connection with the pursuit of an undertaking’s activity, or have deducted the assets of the undertaking, organised its insolvency or aggravated that insolvency by committing credit fraud and, on the other hand, must have been cooperative and acted with diligence during the bankruptcy proceedings.

Thus, the bankruptcy discharge procedure involves an examination conducted on a case-by-case basis by a judicial body. It also permits the Member State concerned, holding a VAT claim, first, to issue an opinion at the request of the debtor seeking to benefit from that procedure, prior to the decision ruling on that request, and, secondly, to bring an action, as appropriate, against the decision declaring the VAT debts which have not been settled in full to be irrecoverable, leading to a second review by a court.</p>
