          It should be borne in mind that the duty to state reasons established by Article 296 TFEU is an essential procedural requirement which must be distinguished from the question whether the reasoning is well founded, which is concerned with the substantive legality of the measure at issue. The reasoning of a decision consists in a formal statement of the grounds on which that decision is based. If those grounds are vitiated by errors, the latter will vitiate the substantive legality of the decision, but not the statement of reasons in it, which may be adequate even though it sets out reasons which are incorrect. It follows that objections and arguments intended to establish that a measure is not well founded are irrelevant in the context of a ground of appeal alleging an inadequate statement of reasons or a lack of such a statement (judgment of 18 June 2015, Ipatau v Council,

According to the General Court, it ‘follows that the basis serving as denominator is smaller than that constituted by all the hours of work and that, consequently, the hourly rate is higher’, so that ‘once applied to the hours actually worked in the context of the projects, it results in a costs declaration of a higher amount’.</p>

It considers that the Commission merely formulated general principles and referred, in Article II.19(1)(b) of the general conditions, to the usual accounting principles of the contractor. It states that the principle of good faith is part of the general principles of EU law established by the Court.

          As regards the second part of that ground of appeal, alleging the breach, by the General Court, of the principle of good faith, it must be noted that, according to the case-law of the Court of Justice, to allow a party to put forward for the first time before the Court of Justice a plea in law which it did not raise before the General Court would in effect allow that party to bring before the Court of Justice a wider case than that heard by the General Court. In an appeal, the Court’s jurisdiction is, as a general rule, confined to a review of the assessment by the General Court of the pleas argued before it. However, an argument which was not raised at first instance does not constitute a new plea that is inadmissible at the appeal stage if it is simply an amplification of an argument already developed in the context of a plea set out in the application before the General Court (judgment of 28 July 2016 in Tomana and Others v Council and Commission,

The appellant acknowledges that the General Court limited the consequences of the application of Article II.30 of the general conditions. To that effect, it considered, first, in paragraph 94 of the judgment under appeal, that that Article could not apply to the mere harm linked to the delay in repayment of the unduly paid advances. It applied, second, the possibility set out in Article 1231 of the Belgian Civil Code of restricting the amount of the liquidated damages that the Commission is entitled to claim to 10% of the amount of the advances to be repaid. In doing so, the General Court reduced the amounts to repay, whilst maintaining the applicability of Article II.30 of the general conditions to the present case. The appellant claims that the General Court should have held Article II.30 to be invalid on the ground that it is contrary to Article 1172 of the Belgian Civil Code and, therefore, held that the appellant was not under an obligation to pay any damages.</p>
