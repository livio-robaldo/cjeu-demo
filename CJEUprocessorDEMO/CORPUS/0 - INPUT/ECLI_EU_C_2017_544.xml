Last, the second paragraph of Article 133 of that directive does not permit Member States to deprive, across the aboard, all local authorities of the benefit of that exemption, since it is necessary to determine ‘in each individual case’ whether that exemption is likely to cause distortions of competition. The tax authority did not accept those arguments.</p>
