It therefore lowered the score given to the [appellant’s] tender for award criterion 3 from 11.8 points to 7 points, the minimum required score being 7.5 out of 15.

In that regard, it is apparent from paragraph 105 of the application and from paragraph 3 of the reply at first instance that the loss of opportunity and the costs of participation constituted, for the appellant, heads of damage for which compensation is available, irrespective of the question of the certainty of being awarded the contract.</p>

In doing so, the General Court restricted the action for damages solely to instances of unlawful acts which had a certain influence over the award of the contract, whereas, in accordance with the General Court’s case-law, any unlawful act in the tender procedure capable of affecting the chances of a tenderer being awarded the contract in question gives rise to an entitlement to compensation.</p>

Next, in paragraph 42 of that judgment, it summarised Agriconsulting’s arguments as follows: ‘The [appellant] contends that the condition relating to the causal link is satisfied because its tender was ranked in first place and it would have been awarded the contract had it not been for the alleged infringements.’ Finally in paragraphs 43 to 46 of that judgment, the General Court responded to the arguments summarised above by finding, in essence, that the alleged unlawful acts did not exhibit a direct causal link with the heads of loss relied upon by the appellant.</p>

In its appeal, the appellant does not maintain that the alleged misrepresentation or distortion of its arguments by the General Court in paragraph 42 of the judgment under appeal vitiated the analysis in those paragraphs. It therefore relies on misrepresentation without explaining the inferences which it draws from that. To that extent, the first part of the first ground of appeal is ineffective.</p>

          With regard to the second part of the first ground of appeal, as summarised in paragraph 11 above, suffice it to state that, in paragraphs 43 to 45 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court did not hold in a general and abstract manner that the unlawful acts affecting a tender procedure, such as those alleged in the present case by Agriconsulting in relation to award criteria 1 and 2, can never entitle a tenderer to compensation. In the present case, the General Court merely assessed
          <span class="italic">in concreto</span>
          whether such a right to compensation existed, in the light of the arguments submitted by the appellant concerning the causal link and by carrying out an assessment of the facts of the case.

The General Court acknowledged that situation in paragraphs 56 and 57 of the judgment under appeal by then concluding that the committee had taken that bid into account in its entirety.

          In that regard, it should be recalled that, in paragraph 55 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court set out the case-law of the Court of Justice which indicates that the abnormally low nature of a tender must be assessed by reference to the composition of the tender and the services at issue (see, by analogy, judgment of 18 December 2014, Data Medical Service,
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2014%3A2466&amp;locale=en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch" hreflang="en" class="CourtLink">C‑568/13</a>

          ). Next, in paragraph 56 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court summarised the content of the Commission’s letter of 25 March 2013, in which the Commission informed the appellant that its tender had been rejected, and the content of the final evaluation report. In paragraph 57 of that judgment, it noted that the anomalies which led the evaluation committee to find that the appellant’s tender was abnormally low referred more specifically to certain additional tasks. However, in paragraphs 58 to 61 of that judgment, the General Court found inter alia that, in view of the economic and financial significance of the additional tasks in the price of the contract in question, the anomalies identified were liable to undermine the consistency of Agriconsulting’s overall bid. It thus concluded, in paragraph 62 of that judgment, that the evaluation committee had conducted its assessment of the abnormally low nature of Agriconsulting’s tender by reference to the composition of the tender and the services at issue, taking account of the factors that were relevant in the light of those services.

In the present case, since the evaluation committee’s request was formulated to the effect that it concerned, not the validity of the prices offered in Agriconsulting’s tender, but the method of calculating those prices, the appellant was prompted to provide information concerning only the figures for that calculation. It should therefore have had the opportunity to provide additional information in order to remove any doubt over the substance of the figures in question. In that regard, the case-law does not limit to one single communication a tenderer’s right to make observations. On the contrary, the principle of an adversarial procedure in that context means that, after initial observations have been made, it may provide additional details within reason.</p>

First of all, the General Court wrongly held that the price of Agriconsulting’s tender alone was sufficient to establish that the tender was abnormally low. It failed to take into consideration the fact that, having regard to the reference economic parameters, VLM’s tender also appeared to be abnormally low. Most importantly, the General Court should have found that Agriconsulting and VLM, as regards their respective tenders, were in fact in the same situation. First, those tenders concerned the same contract and, secondly, their reliability was challenged — as regards the former, by the contracting authority and, as regards the latter, by Agriconsulting.</p>

In the present case, that means that the appellant was authorised to provide information in addition to the information contained in its letter of reply of 29 November 2012, given that the formulation of the Commission’s letter of 22 November 2012 did not make it possible to assess correctly the information requested by that institution.</p>

        <p class="normal">Furthermore, the General Court found, in paragraph 68 of its judgment, that Agriconsulting had not provided any figures to support its argument that the cost unit used to calculate the cost of the experts was a subjective parameter. Furthermore, it stated that the fact that Agriconsulting relies on negotiations on rates with experts of the same category as those to be used in the main tasks tends to confirm that those costs were lower than normal, without, however, any specific justification being provided.</p>

In that respect, the General Court was entitled merely to find that Agriconsulting had not justified its claims with regard to the reference economic parameters being inappropriate and the rates being lower than it would have been able to negotiate. Indeed the appellant does not claim that the General Court erred in law by placing on it such a burden of proof. Therefore there is no merit to the appellant’s claim that the General Court distorted or misrepresented its application.</p>

          With regard to Agriconsulting’s claim that the General Court disregarded the simulation which it produced in order to demonstrate the arbitrary and unreliable nature of the reference economic parameters, suffice it to state that the appeal is limited to questions of law. The General Court thus has exclusive jurisdiction to establish and assess the relevant facts and to assess the value which should be attached to the items of evidence produced to it, unless there has been a distortion of the facts or evidence (order of 11 November 2003, Martinez v Parliament,

The fact that the General Court did not refer to it in paragraphs 63 to 69 of that judgment shows — no more, no less — that it did not consider it to be compelling in that context, such an assessment falling solely within its jurisdiction, barring any distortion.</p>

In addition, if, by that argument, the appellant intends to call into question that finding of the General Court, the argument is inadmissible for the reasons set out in paragraph 64 above.</p>
