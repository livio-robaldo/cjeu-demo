Furthermore, according to the Commission, that change of priorities in the procedure for the adoption of that list was explained inter alia by tensions reported about the treatment of plant ingredients under the legislation on health claims and under legislation governing traditional herbal medicinal products, and by the need to continue the reflection on the consistent treatment of those ingredients. Consequently, the Commission requested the EFSA to suspend temporarily its assessment of the health claims relating to botanical substances and to concentrate instead on all the other claims submitted with a view to completing the examination of those claims as soon as possible. In that context, the Commission explained that the health claims concerning substances other than botanical substances would be examined in a first stage, whereas claims relating to botanical substances would be examined in a second stage.</p>

Consequently, according to the General Court, Article 17(5) of Regulation No 1924/2006, which allows, in principle, any food business operator to make permitted health claims included in the definitive list, places those health claims in the same situation as health claims on hold, that is to say, in a situation in which they may be used for the marketing of food.</p>

        <p class="normal">Moreover, the General Court held, in paragraphs 44 and 45 of the order in Case T‑619/14 and paragraphs 43 and 44 of the order in Case T‑620/14, that, in any event, even if it could be established that there were consequences for the legal situation of Bionorica and other food business operators under Article 17(5) of Regulation No 1924/2006 by comparison, inter alia, with its situation under the transitional provisions provided for in Article 28(5) and (6) of the regulation, such a benefit rested, by definition, on the premiss that its health claims on hold would be authorised on conclusion of the EFSA’s assessment and in the Commission’s final decision. However, the General Court observed that that premiss remained, for the time being, a premiss and, for that reason, could not satisfy the requirements of the case-law, which established that, if the interest pleaded by an applicant concerns a future legal situation, it must demonstrate that the prejudice to that situation is already certain. In that regard, the General Court recalled that, by Regulation No 432/2012, which established a partial list of permitted health claims, the Commission had authorised only 222 health claims out of a total of more than 2000 claims examined, such that the transitional regime could prove to be more advantageous for the operators than the definitive list of permitted health claims.</p>

        <p class="normal">Thirdly, the General Court did not accept the assertions made by Bionorica and Diapharma that they were strongly affected by the legal uncertainty governing the market owing to the lack of a definitive and complete decision by the Commission on the authorisation of health claims. In that regard, the General Court noted, in paragraphs 51 and 52 of the order in Case T‑619/14 and paragraphs 50 and 51 of the order in Case T‑620/14, that the principle of legal certainty required that legal rules be clear and precise, and that their consequences be foreseeable. According to the General Court, both the rules applicable to, on the one hand, authorised or rejected health claims and, on the other hand, health claims on hold, satisfy those requirements. In particular, the rules to which the health claims on hold were subject flowed expressly from Regulation No 1924/2006 and, in particular, Article 28(5) and (6) thereof, which set out the rules applicable, since the adoption of that regulation, to health claims pending an assessment and a final decision.</p>

          Finally, in the third place, the General Court examined and upheld, in Case T‑620/14 only, the plea of inadmissibility, relied on by the Commission, alleging that Bionorica and Diapharm lacked
          <span class="italic">locus standi</span>
          . The General Court found in that regard, in paragraph 56 of the order in Case T‑620/14, that Diapharm — which is a company supplying advisory and support services (including in respect of health claims on food) to companies in the health industry — does not manufacture or market those types of products on the European Union market. For that reason, according to the General Court, Diapharm is not sufficiently linked to the latter activities for it to be regarded as being directly concerned by the act to be adopted by the Commission following a possible finding of failure to act on its part.

Furthermore, they submit that the process of reflection to which the Commission referred in the letters of 19 June 2014, in the context of which a consultation document on the further assessment of those claims was sent to the Member States, was commenced by that institution in July 2012 and completed at the end of 2012 with the majority of the Member States deciding in favour of the continuation of the assessment in accordance with the scientific approach applied until then, including of the health claims on hold.

Moreover, it is not contested that Bionorica and Diapharm, by their letters of 22 and 24 April 2014 respectively (referred to in paragraph 24 above) duly requested the Commission to act, namely to ask the EFSA to resume immediately the assessment of the health claims relating to botanical substances with a view to the adoption of a definitive list of permitted claims and, in reply to those letters, the Commission restricted itself to concluding, in the letters of 19 June 2014 (referred to in paragraph 25 above) that ‘to identify the best course of action needed, [it] should be allowed the time and context necessary for that purpose.’</p>

In German practice such court supervision, which can lead to an immediate suspension of sales on German territory, would involve a summary examination that does not systematically give rise to outcomes that are materially justifiable and which, moreover, may differ radically from one court to another in respect of the same health claim, above all given the imprecise legal criterion of generally accepted scientific evidence which leaves scope for widely diverging interpretations.</p>

In addition, Bionorica and Diapharm submit in that regard that the EU legislature has not expressly laid down transitional measures for the period after 31 January 2010, namely after the deadline set in Article 13(3) of Regulation No 1924/2006 for the adoption of the list of permitted health claims.</p>

The transitional measures that apply to the health claims on hold, which, first, mean that for each case a new assessment in which there is, as regards the assessment of scientific evidence, a wide margin of discretion, and which, second, can lead to widely diverging — even contradictory — outcomes, in particular in German judicial practice, would not produce sufficiently foreseeable legal consequences.</p>

According to the Commission, that finding is correct in law in the light of the provisions of Article 28(5) and (6) of Regulation No 1924/2006. By contrast, it goes without saying, according to the Commission, that the use of lawful health claims, whether they are authorised or on hold, presupposes that the conditions laid down for that purpose by the European Union are satisfied in each case. In addition, the appellants’ observations as regards the alleged negative effects of the application of national law in force should be directed, regarding their substance, not against the General Court but, first, against the German legislature and the German courts and, second, against the EU legislature that adopted the transitional provisions concerned.</p>

According to the Commission, that argument, which could never in any case emanate from a company in the food sector wishing to use a health claim, shows that the appellants attach importance not to the authorisation of health claims relating to botanical substances but only to the existence of any list whatsoever, which could certainly have effects for the legal situation of other businesses but which, with regard to the appellants’ commercial activities, can only concern their factual situation.</p>

As to Diapharm, the rejection or authorisation or even the continued suspension of the health claims relating to botanical substances would also have no effect on its legal situation, given that that company could carry on its advisory activities in all those situations.</p>
