By decision of 20 August 2014, the Hauptzollamt rejected GROFA’s complaint, finding that the cameras at issue in Case C‑435/15 are multifunctional machines, within the meaning of Note 3 to Section XVI of the CN, whose main function is that of a video camera recorder. According to the Hauptzollamt, those cameras should be classified as ‘other’ video camera recorders under tariff subheading 8525 80 99 of the CN. The Hauptzollamt relied, in the first place, on the Explanatory Notes to the CN concerning position 8525, according to which multifunction digital cameras must not be classified as digital cameras if they are capable, using the maximum storage capacity, of recording, in a quality of 800 × 600 pixels (or higher) at 23 frames per second (or higher) at least 30 minutes in a single sequence of video. That is the case in respect of the cameras at issue in Case C‑435/15. The fact that the video sequences are stored on more than one file on the memory card after 26 minutes and 4 seconds has no effect on the total duration of the recording. In the second place, the Hauptzollamt considered that the fact that those cameras can store video files with sound, transferred from an exterior source via the USB port, is characteristic of a recording of images and sound, within the meaning of tariff subheading 8525 80 99 of the CN.</p>

          According to the referring court, it is not disputed that the cameras at issue in Case C‑666/15 can be placed in ‘video record’ mode for longer than 30 minutes for recordings with a resolution of 800 × 600 pixels (or higher) at 23 frames per second (or higher). In that regard, it states that a recording of more than 30 minutes is stored by those cameras in different video files which are recognised as separate files when they are played back, the playback stopping at the end of each file. The user must click on a new file and press ‘
          <span class="italic">play</span>
          ’ in order to play back the next file. The referring court adds that those cameras only allow files that have been recorded on those cameras to be watched. Moreover, the instructions for all the cameras at issue in Case C‑666/15 state that they offer a ‘
          <span class="italic">looping</span>
          ’ option which permits them to record for longer than 30 minutes before a new video is recorded over the previous video (

          It should be noted, first, that it is settled case-law that a classification regulation is of general application in so far as it does not apply to an individual trader but, in general, to products which are the same as that examined by the Customs Code Committee. In the interpretation of a classification regulation, in order to determine its scope, account must be taken, inter alia, of its statement of reasons (see judgment of 15 December 2016, LEK,

Those cameras are not identical to ‘pocket sized video recorders’ covered by that regulation, since, as the referring court notes, those products differ, inter alia, in respect of their capacity to take photographs and by the fact that they do not have a digital zoom, a loudspeaker or a built-in internal memory.</p>

          Secondly, it should be noted that according to the settled case-law of the Court if a classification regulation is not directly applicable to products which are not identical, but only similar to the product covered by that regulation, the latter is applicable by analogy to such products (judgment of 22 September 2016, Kawasaki Motors Europe,
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2016%3A716&amp;locale=en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch" hreflang="en" class="CourtLink">C‑91/15</a>

          and the case-law cited). The application by analogy of a classification regulation, such as Implementing Regulation No 1249/2011, to products similar to those covered by that regulation facilitates a coherent interpretation of the CN and the equal treatment of traders (see, to that effect, judgment of 13 July 2006, Anagram International,

          It should be pointed out in that connection that a classification regulation, such as, in this case, Regulation No 876/2014, is adopted by the Commission on the advice of the Customs Code Committee where the classification in the CN of a particular product is such as to give rise to difficulty or to be a matter for dispute. According to the case-law of the Court, the Council of the European Union has conferred upon the Commission, acting in cooperation with the customs experts of the Member States, a broad discretion to define the subject matter of tariff headings falling to be considered for the classification of particular goods. However, the Commission’s power to adopt the measures referred to in Article 9 of Regulation No 2658/87, as amended by Regulation No 254/2000, does not authorise it to alter the subject matter and the scope of the tariff headings (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 March 2004, Krings,

          In the present case, Implementing Regulation No 876/2014 classifies, under subheading 8525 80 99 of the CN, ‘action cameras’, without requiring that those cameras may be used independently to record external video signals, that is to say, without relying on external materials or software with which they were not originally equipped. Such an independent recording capacity is a prerequisite for the classification of goods under tariff subheading 8525 80 99 of the CN.
