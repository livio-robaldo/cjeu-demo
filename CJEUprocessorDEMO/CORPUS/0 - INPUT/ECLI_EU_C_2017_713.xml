          Riva claims that the General Court cannot base its reasoning in paragraphs 115 and 120 of the judgment under appeal on the case-law cited in those paragraphs, since that case-law concerns the assumption that, first, the illegality vitiating the 2002 decision occurred only upon the adoption of that decision and, second, the charges on which that decision and the decision adopted later were based were the same, the two decisions being identical in every way. Yet, in the present case, it is not a matter of a simple procedural defect committed by the Commission. On the contrary, the errors committed by the institution were reflected in the overall approach taken by it and were not confined to the identification of the act’s legal basis. They affected the substance of the infringement, including the definition of the relevant geographical market, the application of the principle
          <span class="italic">lex mitior</span>
          as well as the calculation of the amount of the fine. In addition, the General Court recognised that the 2002 decision and the decision at issue were not identical in their reasoning, in the legal classification of certain conduct or their enacting terms.

In paragraph 120 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court relied on a comparison between the contents of the two decisions and referred to the Commission’s decision following the annulment of the 2002 decision to adopt an identical decision relating to the same objections on which the undertakings had already submitted observations.</p>

        <p class="normal">Against that background, the allegation that the General Court made an error of law in paragraph 122 of the judgment under appeal and contradicted itself in relation to paragraph 120 of the same judgment must be rejected. As the Commission notes in its response, paragraph 120 concerns the complaints on which the 2002 decision and the decision at issue are based, whilst paragraph 122 concerns the comparison of those decisions made by Riva, which the General Court classed as irrelevant since it is the statement of objections and access to the file that allows the undertakings under investigation to acquaint themselves with the evidence the Commission has at its disposal and that render the rights of the defence fully effective. Contrary to Riva’s claim, any difference between the texts of the two decisions, which in any case Riva has not demonstrated, does not necessarily imply, in itself, that the allegations against the undertakings concerned changed.</p>

          In respect of Riva’s request to the Court to declare a breach of Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, it should be recalled that a breach, by a Court of the European Union, of its obligation under that provision to adjudicate on the cases before it within a reasonable time must be sanctioned in an action for damages brought before the General Court, since such an action constitutes an effective remedy. Accordingly, a claim for compensation for the damage caused by the failure on the part of the General Court to adjudicate within a reasonable time may not be made directly to the Court of Justice in the context of an appeal, but must be brought before the General Court itself. The General Court, which has jurisdiction under Article 256(1) TFEU, hearing a claim for damages, is required to rule on such a claim sitting in a different composition from that which heard the dispute which gave rise to the procedure whose duration is criticised (judgment of 9 June 2016, Repsol Lubricantes y Especialidades and Others v Commission,
