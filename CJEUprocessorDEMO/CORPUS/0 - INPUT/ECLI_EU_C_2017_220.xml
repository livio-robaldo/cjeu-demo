To that effect, the Administratīvā apgabaltiesa (Regional Administrative Court) was entitled to rely on Commission Decision C(2012) 8694 of 30 November 2012, finding that it is justified in dispensing with post-clearance recovery in a particular case (file REC 01/2011), since the factual circumstances which led the Commission to adopt that decision are effectively the same as those of the case at issue in the main proceedings.</p>

By contrast, if the error was committed by the customs authorities of the exporting country, which knew or should have known that the goods at issue did not satisfy the requisite conditions, the issue of an incorrect certificate must not, according to that court, cause prejudice to the importer.</p>

First, it is necessary that the duties were not levied as a result of an error on the part of the competent authorities themselves, secondly, that the error committed by those authorities was such that it could not reasonably have been detected by a person liable for payment acting in good faith and, finally, that the latter complied with all the provisions laid down by the legislation in force as regards the customs declaration (see, inter alia, judgments of 18 October 2007, Agrover,

          The Court has also held that it is the responsibility of traders to make the necessary arrangements in their contractual relations in order to guard against the risks of an action for post-clearance recovery, and that such prevention may, in particular, consist, for the person liable for payment, in the receipt from the other contracting party, on or after the conclusion of the contract, of all the necessary evidence confirming that the goods come from the State which is a ‘beneficiary country’ vis-à-vis the generalised tariff preferences scheme, including documents establishing that origin (see, to that effect, judgment of 8 November 2012, Lagura Vermögensverwaltung,

        <p class="normal">In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question is that Article 220(2)(b) of the Customs Code must be interpreted as meaning that an importer may not rely on a legitimate expectation, in accordance with that provision, in order to object to a post-clearance incurring of liability for import duties, submitting that he acted in good faith, unless three cumulative conditions are met. It is necessary, first of all, that those duties were not levied as a result of an error on the part of the competent authorities themselves, secondly, that that error was such that it could not reasonably have been detected by a person liable for payment acting in good faith and, finally, that that person complied with all the provisions laid down by the legislation in force as regards his customs declaration. Such a legitimate expectation is lacking, in particular, where, although there are clear reasons for doubting the accuracy of a Form A certificate of origin, an importer failed to obtain, using his best efforts, information concerning the circumstances of the issue of that certificate in order to verify whether those doubts were well founded. Such an obligation does not however mean that an importer is required, in general, to systematically verify the circumstances of the issue, by the customs authorities of the exporting country, of a Form A certificate of origin. It is for the referring court to determine, taking into account all of the specific facts of the dispute in the main proceedings, whether those three conditions are met in this case.</p>

          As regards, more particularly, the conduct of the exporter, it is apparent from paragraphs 27 to 32 of the present judgment that an importer may rely on a legitimate expectation and, on that basis, avoid post-clearance recovery of the customs duties, where the issue, by the customs authorities of the exporting country, of an incorrect Form A certificate of origin can be imputed to the conduct of the exporter (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 15 December 2011, Afasia Knits Deutschland,

          As is apparent from the Court’s case-law relating to the rules on the apportion of the burden of proof in such cases, it is, in principle, for the customs authorities of the importing country intending to effect a post-clearance recovery of the customs duties, to adduce evidence of the fact that the issue, by the customs authorities of the exporting country, of an incorrect Form A certificate of origin is attributable to an incorrect statement of the facts by the exporter. However, where, in particular, as a result of negligence wholly attributable to the exporter, the customs authorities of the exporting country are unable to adduce that evidence, it is, as the case may be, for the importer to prove that that certificate was issued on the basis of a correct statement of the facts by the exporter (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgments of 9 March 2006, Beemsterboer Coldstore Services,

To the extent, however, that such a report contains only a general description of the situation at issue, which it is for the national court to determine, it cannot, on its own, suffice in order to show to the requisite legal standard that those conditions are indeed met in all respects, in particular as regards the relevant conduct of the exporter. In those circumstances, it is, in principle, for the customs authorities of the importing country to prove, by means of additional evidence, that the issue, by the customs authorities of the exporting country, of an incorrect Form A certificate of origin is attributable to an incorrect statement of the facts by the exporter. However, where the customs authorities of the importing country are unable to adduce that evidence, it is, as the case may be, for the importer to prove that that certificate was issued on the basis of a correct statement of the facts by the exporter.</p>

It is necessary, first of all, that those duties were not levied as a result of an error on the part of the competent authorities themselves, secondly, that that error was such that it could not reasonably have been detected by a person liable for payment acting in good faith and, finally, that that person complied with all the provisions laid down by the legislation in force as regards his customs declaration. Such a legitimate expectation is lacking, in particular, where, although there are clear reasons for doubting the accuracy of a Form A certificate of origin, an importer failed to obtain, using his best efforts, information concerning the circumstances of the issue of that certificate in order to verify whether those doubts were well founded. Such an obligation does not however mean that an importer is required, in general, to systematically verify the circumstances of the issue, by the customs authorities of the exporting country, of a Form A certificate of origin. It is for the referring court to determine, taking into account all of the specific facts of the dispute in the main proceedings, whether those three conditions are met in this case.</span>
