Accordingly, the referring court is uncertain whether the 12-month time limit laid down in Article 145(3) of the implementing regulation complies with Article 29 of the Customs Code, read in conjunction with Article 78 of that code, since those provisions do not provide for a time limit on adjustments of the customs value following an adjustment to the price, and with Article 236 of that code, since it provides for a three-year time limit for the filing of applications for repayment of customs duties.

          ) that Article 145(2) and (3) of the implementing regulation, as introduced by Regulation No 444/2002, does not apply to situations arising prior to the entry into force of that latter regulation on the ground that that provision would undermine the legitimate expectations of the economic operators concerned. The Court has held that that was the case since the competent customs authorities were applying the general time limit of three years laid down in Article 236(2) of the Customs Code in the event of adjustment, after import, of the transaction value of goods due to the fact that they were defective, in order to determine their customs value.
