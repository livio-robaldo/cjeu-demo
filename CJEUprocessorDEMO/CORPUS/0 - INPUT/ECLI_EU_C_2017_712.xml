The VAT refund cannot depend, according to SMS Meer, on the proof of circulation of those goods following importation, given that contract No 27 had not in the end been completed. At the time the goods were imported, the parties still wished to carry out the transaction.</p>

Secondly, he must not during that period have made any supplies of goods or services in respect of which the place of supply is deemed to be in that Member State, with the exception of certain supplies of specified services (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 February 2014, E.ON Global Commodities,

However, the Court, which is called on to provide answers of use to the national court, may provide guidance based on the documents in the file in the main proceedings and on the observations submitted to it, in order to enable the national court to give judgment (judgment of 11 May 2017, Posnania Investment,

          It is settled case-law of the Court that, in the absence of fraud or abuse, and subject to any adjustments which may be made in accordance with the conditions laid down by the VAT Directive, the right of refund, once it has arisen, is retained (see, by analogy, judgment of 22 March 2012, Klub,

          More specifically, where the taxable person has been unable to use the goods or services which gave rise to a refund in the context of the planned transaction by reason of circumstances beyond his control, the right of refund is retained since, in such a case, there is no risk of fraud or abuse capable of justifying a refusal to refund (see, by analogy, judgment of 22 March 2012, Klub,
