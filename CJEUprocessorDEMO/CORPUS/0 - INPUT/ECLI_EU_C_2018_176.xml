Therefore, copper compounds would be the subject, in principle, of twice as many approval renewal applications, which increases the costs associated with maintaining approval for those compounds. That effect is direct and does not require any implementing measure on the part of the Commission or Member States.</p>

In that regard, contrary to the General Court’s finding made in paragraph 48 of the order under appeal, Member States make the companies concerned bear the costs not only of the comparative assessment but also of carrying out the assessment itself, while the national authorities restrict themselves to adopting a decision on the application for renewal of the authorisation for the plant protection product in question. Thus, the appellant and its members are required to meet the obligations resulting from the comparative assessment irrespective of the final result of that assessment.</p>

Article 50(4) of Regulation No 1107/2009 requires Member States to perform the comparative assessment regularly and, at the latest, at renewal or amendment of the authorisation. Therefore, no application for authorisation or renewal of an authorisation would be necessary for the Member State concerned to carry out a comparative assessment of copper compounds, which would be the direct consequence of their classification as candidates for substitution.</p>

          It must be recalled at the outset that the admissibility of an action brought by a natural or legal person against an act which is not addressed to them, in accordance with the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, is subject to the condition that they be accorded standing to bring proceedings, which arises in two situations. First, such proceedings may be instituted if the act is of direct and individual concern to those persons. Second, such persons may bring proceedings against a regulatory act not entailing implementing measures if that act is of direct concern to them (see, inter alia, judgment of 17 September 2015, Mory and Others v Commission,

          In that regard, it must be recalled that the expression ‘which … does not entail implementing measures’, within the meaning of the final limb of the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, must be interpreted in the light of the objective of that provision, which is, as is apparent from its drafting history, to ensure that individuals do not have to break the law in order to have access to a court. Where a regulatory act directly affects the legal situation of a natural or legal person without requiring implementing measures, that person could be denied effective judicial protection if he did not have a legal remedy before the European Union judicature for the purpose of challenging the legality of the regulatory act. In the absence of implementing measures, natural or legal persons, although directly concerned by the act in question, would be able to obtain a judicial review of that act only after having infringed its provisions, by pleading that those provisions are unlawful in proceedings initiated against them before the national courts (judgment of 28 April 2015, T &amp;amp; L Sugars and Sidul Açúcares v Commission,

          By contrast, where a regulatory act entails implementing measures, judicial review of compliance with the European Union legal order is ensured irrespective of whether those measures were adopted by the European Union or the Member States.

The same measure may be an implementing measure both of the act the provisions of which constitute its legal base and of a different act, such as, in the present case, the regulation at issue, where all or part of the legal effects of the latter act will be produced, vis-à-vis the applicant, only through the intermediary of that measure (see, by analogy, judgment of 28 April 2015, T &amp;amp; L Sugars and Sidul Açúcares v Commission,

Furthermore, to accept the argument put forward by the appellant in that regard would largely defeat the purpose of the condition relating to individual concern, since it would be sufficient for the economic operators, who are only concerned by a European Union act because they meet an objective legal or factual situation defined by that measure, to group themselves within a representative association, such as the one in question in the present case, in order for them to be recognised as having

First, it is not certain that a negative decision on the renewal of approval of copper compounds will be adopted. Consequently, the appellant and its members might never be in a position to challenge the regulation at issue, which will continue therefore to produce legal effects indefinitely. Secondly, even if a negative decision were adopted, irrespective of the possibility of making a reference to the Court for a preliminary ruling, the appellant and its members would have to bear the administrative burden and economic costs resulting from the classification of copper compounds as a candidate for substitution.</p>

          However, judicial review of compliance with the European Union legal order is ensured, as can be seen from Article 19(1) TEU, not only by the Court of Justice but also by the courts and tribunals of the Member States. The FEU Treaty has established, by Articles 263 and 277, on the one hand, and Article 267, on the other, a complete system of legal remedies and procedures designed to ensure judicial review of the legality of European Union acts, and has entrusted such review to the European Union judicature (judgment of 28 April 2015, T &amp;amp; L Sugars and Sidul Açúcares v Commission,
