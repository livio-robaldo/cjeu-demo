        <p class="normal">Under the ‘Hire Purchase’ agreement, the aggregate of the monthly payments made represents, as a rule, the total sale price of the vehicle, including the cost of financing. A modest additional fee (‘the option fee’) must be paid in order to acquire ownership of the vehicle at the end of the contract. That final payment is provided for in the agreement and does not depend on the option being exercised. The option fee is debited from the customer’s account at the same time as the last instalment, and the transfer of ownership is then complete. However, United Kingdom consumer protection legislation limits the amount which a seller can claim from a buyer under the terms of a hire purchase, and it is thus possible, in practice, for the customer to avoid making the final payment by terminating the contract prior to its expiry.</p>

        <p class="normal">Under an ‘Agility’ agreement, monthly instalments are, as a rule, lower than under a ‘Hire Purchase’ agreement; total instalments thus represent only approximately 60% of the vehicle sale price, including the cost of financing. If the user wishes to exercise the option to purchase the vehicle, he must therefore pay approximately 40% of the sale price. That ‘balloon’ payment represents the estimated average residual value of the vehicle at contract maturity. The customer is asked, three months before the end of the contract, whether he wishes to exercise the option. According to the findings of the referring court, around half of all lessees reply in the affirmative.</p>

Nor is it disputed that, conversely, the ‘Hire Purchase’ agreement constitutes a ‘supply of goods’ within the meaning of Article 14(2)(b) of the VAT Directive. Consequently, under Article 64 of that directive, VAT is chargeable in full upon the handing over of the vehicle, the taxable amount being the total price of the supply.</p>
