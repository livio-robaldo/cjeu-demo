However, with the approval of HMRC, a clearance service may make an election for an alternative system of charge, as referred to in section 97A of the FA 1986, under which there is no 1.5% charge on the entry of the shares into the clearance service; instead, any transfer of the shares within the clearance service is charged to SDRT at a rate of 0.5% of the amount of the consideration for the transfer.</p>

        <p class="normal">As regards the transaction that took place in 2006, the United Kingdom submits that it involved the transfer of existing shares to a clearance service, no new capital being raised for the company. It argues that stamp duty could be charged on that transfer under Article 12(1)(a) of Directive 69/335, which provides that, notwithstanding Articles 10 and 11 of the directive, Member States may charge duties on the transfer of securities. The United Kingdom disputes the interpretation put forward by Air Berlin, which contends that Article 12 of Directive 69/335 must be confined solely to situations where there is a change of ownership between persons acting as investors, so that a transfer to a clearance service falls outside the scope of that provision. According to the United Kingdom, the concept of ‘transfer of securities’ in Article 12 of the directive covers any transaction by which a right or interest in securities is transferred from one person to another and is not dependent on the status or capacity of the transferor and transferee. That is, in its submission, the case of a transfer of securities to a clearance service which affects the ownership of the security and fundamentally alters the respective rights of the parties, even though beneficial ownership is not transferred to the clearance service.</p>

        <p class="normal">In that connection, although the referring court has not described in detail either the functioning of the clearance service or the legal, formal and practical consequences of the transfer to Clearstream Frankfurt of legal title to the shares, the United Kingdom has acknowledged that that transfer did not result in the beneficial ownership of the shares being transferred. It is thus apparent that the transfer of legal title, which is required under German law, was merely an operational requirement of the clearance system and had no impact on the right to dispose of the shares or to have the benefit of them. The order for reference indicates in this regard that 2177604 ordinary shares held by employees who were not free to sell them could be listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, although legal title to the shares had been transferred to the clearance service.</p>

That transfer must be regarded as merely an incidental transaction, integral to the transaction admitting the shares to listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, which, in accordance with Article 11 of Directive 69/335, could not be subject to any form of taxation whatsoever.</p>
