The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgment of 23 January 2018, F. Hoffmann-La Roche and Others,

          However, as regards Article 8 of Directive 80/987, now Article 8 of Directive 2008/94, the Court has held that provisions of domestic law that may, in certain cases, lead to a guarantee of benefits limited to less than half the entitlement accrued cannot be considered to fall within the definition of the word ‘protect’ used in that provision (see, to that effect, judgment of 25 January 2007, Robins and Others,

          In the present case, it is therefore necessary to examine whether Article 8 of Directive 2008/94 is unconditional and sufficiently precise. There are three points to be considered in that assessment: the identity of the persons entitled to the protection provided in Article 8, the content of that protection and the identity of the person liable to provide the protection (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 November 1991, Francovich and Others,

According to that act, if that valuation, after approval by the Board of the PPF, shows that the scheme’s assets are sufficient to cover the costs of the protected liabilities, that scheme, while subject to the directions of the Board of the PPF, will continue to be managed by its trustees. By contrast, if the scheme’s assets prove to be insufficient, the 2004 Act provides that the Board of the PPF is to assume responsibility for the scheme, which means that the managers of the scheme will be discharged from their pension obligations and the Board of the PPF will be responsible for ensuring that compensation is paid.</p>

          Second, according to the request for a preliminary ruling, the dispute in the main proceedings does not concern whether Mr Hampshire may demand directly from the T&amp;amp;N scheme or from its trustees payment of compensation corresponding to at least 50% of his accrued pension entitlement under that scheme, but rather the lawfulness of the decision by which the Board of the PPF approved the protected liabilities of that scheme. As the Advocate General noted in points 89, 91 and 92 of her Opinion, the purpose of the dispute is to determine whether Article 8 of Directive 2008/94 may be invoked to require the Board of the PPF to conduct a revaluation of the protected liabilities. In that respect, the impact that a new calculation of the PPF compensation might have on the T&amp;amp;N scheme would be a mere adverse repercussion on the rights of third parties and does not justify a failure to recognise that that provision has direct effect and may be relied on against a body which must be regarded as an emanation of the State (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 October 2015, T-Mobile Czech Republic and Vodafone Czech Republic,
