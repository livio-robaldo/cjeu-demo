Those courts held that the 2011 and 2012 agreements included a financial collateral arrangement regarding the funds credited to the account opened in Aviabaltika’s name with that bank. They considered that, following the commencement of the insolvency proceedings against Ūkio bankas, those funds were included in the assets remaining after the insolvency and that the right of that bank to make use of them was limited by the prohibition on discharging any obligation that had not been discharged at the date on which those proceedings were commenced, pursuant to the relevant national legislation.

          Next, regarding the general scheme and objectives of Directive 2002/47, it should be borne in mind that, according to recital 3 thereof, that directive is intended to contribute to the integration and cost-efficiency of the financial market and to the stability of the financial system in the European Union. To that end, Directive 2002/47 establishes a regime, the objective of which is to limit the administrative burdens for parties using financial collateral under the scope of the directive, to improve the legal certainty of such collateral by ensuring that certain provisions of national insolvency law do not apply to financial collateral arrangements in order to safeguard financial stability and limit contagion effects in case of a default of a party to a financial collateral arrangement (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 November 2016, Private Equity Insurance Group,

Such a requirement, inasmuch as it enables the provider to avoid paying, in practice, the amount of that collateral which corresponds to its debt a second time, could help prevent contagion effects in the event of the taker’s insolvency.</p>

It is not apparent from the statements set out in the request for a preliminary ruling that the referring court is hearing a counterclaim for repayment of the financial collateral brought against that bank, nor that it is called upon to resolve the matters relating to the recovery of Aviabaltika’s claim against Ūkio bankas in relation to that collateral in the context of those insolvency proceedings.</p>
