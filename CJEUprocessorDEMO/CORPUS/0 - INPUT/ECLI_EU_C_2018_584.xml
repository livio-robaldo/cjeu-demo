          As regards the fifth question, which concerns the interpretation of point (b) of the first paragraph of Article 35 of Directive 2013/32, which, in conjunction with Article 33(2)(b) of that directive, authorises Member States to declare an application for international protection inadmissible when the applicant is sufficiently protected in a third country, it follows from the order for reference that that ground of inadmissibility had not yet been transposed into Bulgarian law on the date of adoption of the contested decision. However, based on the assumption that the national provision that has in the meantime transposed that ground of inadmissibility is nevertheless applicable
          <span class="italic">ratione temporis</span>
          to the main proceedings, an assumption which it is for the referring court alone to confirm, that court correctly asks whether it may, in the context of a full and

          examination, as laid down in Article 46(3) of Directive 2013/32, assess the admissibility of the application for international protection at issue in the main proceedings in the light of such a ground of inadmissibility and, if so, what scope should be afforded to that ground of inadmissibility.

In that case, that Palestinian may, unless he or she falls within the scope of any of the grounds for exclusion set out in Article 12(1)(b), Article 12(2) and Article 12(3) of that directive,

          It follows from the information recalled above that Article 12(1)(a) of Directive 2011/95 sets out, first, a ground for exclusion from refugee status and, second, a ground for no longer applying that ground for exclusion, both of which may be decisive for the purpose of assessing whether the Palestinian in question is entitled to access to refugee status in the European Union. As the Advocate General essentially noted in points 43 to 45 of his Opinion, the rules laid down in that provision, as interpreted by the Court, therefore constitute a
          <span class="italic">lex specialis</span>
          . The national provisions transposing that set of rules must be applied to an application for international protection lodged by a person registered with UNRWA, providing that that application has not previously been rejected on the basis of another ground for exclusion or of inadmissibility.

Consequently, the fact that the rules set out in Article 12(1)(a) of Directive 2011/95 do not apply to the part of the application relating to subsidiary protection does not exempt the competent authority from its obligation first to apply the provisions transposing those rules, in order to verify whether refugee status must be granted.</p>

The procedure before a determining authority is governed by the provisions of Chapter III of that directive, entitled ‘Procedures at first instance’, while the procedure before a court or tribunal must comply with the rules laid down in Chapter V of that directive, entitled ‘Appeals procedures’ which is made up of Article 46.</p>

          By its fourth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 46(3) of Directive 2013/32, read in conjunction with Articles 18, 19 and 47 of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that the requirement for a full and
          <span class="italic">ex nunc</span>
          examination both of facts and of points of law also covers the grounds of inadmissibility of the application for international protection referred to in Article 33(2) of that directive and, if so, whether, in the event of an examination of such a ground of inadmissibility by the court or tribunal, even though that ground had not been examined by the determining authority, the file must be referred back to that authority for it to conduct the admissibility interview provided for in Article 34 of that directive.

In accordance with the purpose of Directive 2013/32 of establishing a system in which, at the very least, the court or tribunal seised at first instance of an appeal against a decision of a determining authority must conduct a full and up-to-date examination, that court or tribunal may, inter alia, find that the applicant benefits from sufficient protection in a third country, with the result that it becomes unnecessary to examine the requirement for protection in the European Union.

          assessment of the international protection needs of the applicant by virtue of Directive 2011/95, that body could take a decision that ran counter to that assessment or could allow a considerable period of time to elapse, which could increase the risk that evidence requiring a new up-to-date assessment might arise.
