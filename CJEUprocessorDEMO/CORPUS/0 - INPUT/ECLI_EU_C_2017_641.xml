          As is apparent from the third recital thereof, the Parent-Subsidiary Directive seeks, by the introduction of a common tax system, to eliminate any disadvantage to cooperation between companies of different Member States as compared with cooperation between companies of the same Member State and thereby to facilitate the grouping together of companies at EU level.

          As the Advocate General stated in points 24 and 25 of her Opinion, although Article 1(2) of the Parent-Subsidiary Directive reflects the general principle of EU law that no one may benefit from the rights stemming from the legal system of the European Union for abusive or fraudulent ends, it must nevertheless, in so far as it constitutes a derogation from the tax rules established by that directive, be interpreted strictly (see, to that effect, judgment of 25 September 2003, Océ van der Grinten,
