          In that regard, it must be borne in mind that, according to the Court’s settled case-law, in the context of the cooperation between the Court and the national courts provided for in Article 267 TFEU, it is solely for the national court before which the dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine, in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court.

        <p class="normal">It is clear from the order for reference and from the observations of the Slovak Government that the reasons for the mandatory introduction of an administrative complaint before bringing a legal action are linked, first, to the administrative authority, if it accepts the applicant’s arguments, to remedy more quickly an unlawful situation when it finds that the complaint is well founded, and to avoid seeing unexpected actions brought against that authority in court. Second, those reasons relate to the fact that such an obligation contributes to the efficiency of the judicial procedure where that authority does not share the applicant’s opinion and where the latter then lodges a legal action, because the judge can then rely on the existing administrative record.</p>

          In that regard, it should be recalled that the Court held that the principle of effective judicial protection, reaffirmed in Article 47 of the Charter, did not preclude national legislation making the application of legal action in the field of electronic communications and consumer services subject to the prior implementation of out-of-court conciliation and mediation procedures provided that those procedures do not result in a decision which is binding on the parties, that they do not cause a substantial delay for the purposes of bringing legal proceedings, that they suspend the period for the time-barring of claims and that they do not give rise to costs — or give rise to very low costs — for the parties, and only if electronic means are not the only means by which the settlement procedure may be accessed and interim measures are possible in exceptional cases where the urgency of the situation so requires (see, to that effect, judgments of 18 March 2010, Alassini and Others,

          It should be borne in mind that the requirements concerning the content of a request for a preliminary ruling are expressly set out in Article 94 of the Court’s Rules of Procedure, of which the national court should, in the context of the cooperation instituted by Article 267 TFEU, be aware and which it is bound to observe scrupulously. Thus, the referring court must set out the precise reasons that led it to raise the question of the interpretation of certain provisions of EU law and to consider it necessary to refer questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling. The Court has previously held that it is essential that the national court should give at the very least some explanation of the reasons for the choice of the EU law provisions which it seeks to have interpreted and of the link it establishes between those provisions and the national legislation applicable to the proceedings pending before it (judgment of 9 March 2017, Milkova,
