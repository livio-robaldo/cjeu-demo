The effectiveness of Directive 2000/60 and its aim of protecting the environment, which is recalled in the previous paragraph, require that individuals or, where appropriate, a duly constituted environmental organisation be able to rely on it in legal proceedings and that the national courts be able to take that directive into consideration as an element of EU law in order, inter alia, to review whether a national authority that has granted a permit for a project that may have an effect on the water status has complied with its obligations under Article 4 of the directive, in particular preventing the deterioration of bodies of water, and has thus kept within the limits of the discretion granted to the competent national authorities by that provision (see, by analogy, judgments of 25 July 2008, Janecek,

Consequently, Protect had to participate in the administrative procedure as an ‘interested party’ within the meaning of Paragraph 102(2) of the WRG, which, in accordance with Paragraph 102(3) of the WRG, did not grant it the right to submit objections that the authorities had to take into account before taking a decision on the application for a permit.</p>
