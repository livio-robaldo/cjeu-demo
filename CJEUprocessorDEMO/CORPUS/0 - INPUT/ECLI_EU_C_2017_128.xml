Under German law, a provision should be regarded as conferring legal protection where, having regard to its purpose and content, it is intended to protect individuals or certain groups of persons against the infringement of a particular legal interest. It would be helpful in that regard to ascertain whether the legislature which adopted the provision in question specifically intended, if only as a secondary aim, to afford to certain groups of individuals the legal protection sought on account of the infringement alleged. It is also appropriate to ascertain, as part of a comprehensive assessment of the legislative context in which the provision in question applies, whether the legislature might have intended to make infringement of the protected interest result in the tortious liability of the party infringing that interest.</p>

In interpreting that contract in accordance with German law, the objectives pursued by Directive 93/42 in general through the conformity assessment procedure and, in particular, through the involvement of the notified body via that contract are of crucial importance.</p>

          It should be observed that the Court has previously held, on the basis of, inter alia, the third and fifth recitals of Directive 93/42, that the aim of the directive is not only the protection of health
          <span class="italic">stricto sensu</span>
