Tilly-Sabco argues that that progressive reduction was a political decision and not an application of the criteria laid down in Article 164(3) of Regulation No 1234/2007, as the Commission acknowledged in its defence at first instance by referring to an international undertaking made in that regard.</p>

It states that, the General Court held, in paragraphs 111 and 112 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had not mentioned any urgency in the present case and that, in paragraphs 113 to 119 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court held that the situation concerned was characterised by its urgency which justified ignoring the time limit.</p>

Furthermore, the risk of leaks of the proposed figures has not been established, is not mentioned in Article 3(3) of Regulation No 182/2011 and, therefore, cannot justify the lack of a time limit for examining the draft under consideration. The standard rules of procedure state that there is extreme urgency ‘in particular where there is a threat to human or animal health’.</p>

The appeal does not contain any elements capable of invalidating that finding, even though there is no legal or practical impediments preventing the production of such evidence in the present case. It must be held that the outcome of the deliberation of the Management Committee would have been similar if it had had a period of 10 extra days to examine the draft of the contested regulation, since all the data would have resulted in the refunds being fixed at zero.</p>
