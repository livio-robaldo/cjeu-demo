          It is clear from the wording of Article 23(8) of Directive 2004/18 that a technical specification may not refer to a specific source unless this is justified by the subject matter of the public contract, and that this is permitted on an exceptional basis only.

          With regard to the main proceedings, by not adding the words ‘or equivalent’ after imposing the national origin requirement, the hospital may not only have deterred economic operators with analogous medicinal products from taking part in the tendering procedure, but also have impeded the flow of imports in trade between Member States by reserving the contract for medicinal products derived from Slovenian plasma exclusively to the Institute. In so doing, the hospital has failed to comply with Article 2 of Directive 2004/18, Article 23(2) and (8) thereof and Article 34 TFEU (see, by analogy, judgment of 24 January 1995, Commission v Netherlands,

          The Court has consistently held that, in order to assess whether a Member State has observed the principle of proportionality in the field of public health, account must be taken of the fact that the health and life of humans rank foremost among the assets and interests protected by the FEU Treaty and that it is for the Member States to determine the degree of protection which they wish to afford to public health and the way in which that degree of protection is to be achieved.

          However, it is apparent also from the Court’s case-law that legislation that is capable of restricting a fundamental freedom guaranteed by the FEU Treaty, such as the free movement of goods, can be properly justified only if it is appropriate for securing the attainment of the legitimate objective pursued and does not go beyond what is necessary in order to attain it (see, to that effect, in the context of human health, judgments of 11 September 2008, Commission v Germany,

        <p class="normal">It is true that recital 19 and Article 110 of Directive 2001/83 are both in line with the concept of solidarity. Since they are not paid, all blood donors act in the interest of all individuals with whom they share the same interests, by making it possible, together, inter alia, to guard against risks of insufficient quantities of medicinal products derived from blood or plasma. However, the priority supply principle at issue in the main proceedings, in that it excludes economic operators wishing to import into Slovenia medicinal products derived from plasma coming also from voluntary unpaid blood donations, collected in other Member States, is in clear contradiction to that concept underlying the objective of EU self-sufficiency. Accordingly, inasmuch as (a) the blood donors’ motivation is the same in other Member States as in Slovenia and (b) all donors in the Member States have objectively concurring interests with regard to the manufacture and use of products derived from human blood and human plasma coming from such voluntary unpaid donations, there is no reason to consider, as the Slovenian Government claims, that conditions based on a purely national concept of solidarity are the only ones liable to have a major impact, in Slovenia, on the quantities of human blood and blood components collected and, thus, on the quantities of blood products derived from such donations.</p>

        <p class="normal">It is true that a system of plasma collection such as that at issue in the main proceedings has been established in a global context characterised by a prolonged and undeniable shortage of quality blood and plasma and by a highly concentrated sector for industrial processing of blood and plasma into medicinal products. Moreover, as the Commission has pointed out in its written observations, that continuing tendency induces the few undertakings working in that field to prefer selling medicinal products derived from plasma in countries that can pay a higher price or buy them on a larger scale, and smaller States are thus facing a significantly higher price for medicinal products derived from plasma.</p>
