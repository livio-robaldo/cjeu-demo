          By judgment of 12 October 2011, the Curtea de Apel București (Court of Appeal, Bucharest) dismissed the action brought by Lukoil. That court held, inter alia, that the sum of USD 0.01 per litre included in the price of petroleum products was calculated for the products delivered both in Romania and outside that Member State, so that, not being due by reason of the goods having crossed border, the charge in question was neither a customs duty on exports nor a charge having equivalent effect, but constituted an internal charge. It added that, assuming that the charge imposed by the OUG No 249/2000 constitutes a customs duty prohibited by Article 30 TFEU, Lukoil’s request that that charge be refunded to it would be unfounded, having regard to the prohibition of unjust enrichment, as applied by the Court in the judgment of 14 January 1997, Comateb and Others (

          ). According to the Curtea de Apel București (Court of Appeal, Bucharest), the sum in question was included, by virtue of Article 1 of the OUG No 249/2000, in the price of petrol and diesel supplied outside Romania and was thus borne not by the person supplying petroleum products, but by the customer.

        <p class="normal">In that judgment, the Curtea de Apel București (Court of Appeal, Bucharest) found, on the basis of an expert report on accounting, that, although it had calculated and paid the charge in question to the State, Lukoil had not added the fixed sum of USD 0.01 per litre to the sales price of petroleum products which it sold between 1 January 2007 and 31 March 2010, but had applied such a sum to its own resources. Despite that fact, that court, however, ruled that Lukoil had not proved that the payment of that charge had caused it harm. Lukoil had put in place, on its own initiative, a payment system that is neither attributable to the defendant authority, nor based on the provisions of the OUG No 249/2000. Thus, that court held that Lukoil was not entitled to the requested reimbursement, since the charge at issue had been paid on the basis of provisions not definitively declared unlawful, as contrary to EU law, but a mechanism that Lukoil had itself established and which was not provided for by the national legislation.</p>

That court notes that the disputed charge is a charge having an equivalent effect to a customs duty because it is of a pecuniary nature, it is imposed unilaterally by the competent authority of a Member State and levied on goods by reason of the fact that they cross a border. It states that Lukoil has sought reimbursement of the charges which it has paid it with its own funds between 1 January 2007 and 31 March 2010. The Court has never ruled, having regard to Article 30 TFEU, on the question whether, had it actually borne the burden of a charge having an effect equivalent to a customs duty, a taxpayer may claim reimbursement of the sums paid, even if the payment mechanism for that charge was designed in national legislation in such a way as to pass it on to the consumer.</p>

          Any pecuniary charge, however small and whatever its designation and mode of application, which is imposed unilaterally on goods by reason of the fact that they cross a frontier, and which is not a customs duty in the strict sense, constitutes a charge having equivalent effect to a customs duty. By contrast, pecuniary charges resulting from a general system of internal taxation applied systematically, in accordance with the same objective criteria, to categories of products irrespective of their origin or destination fall within Article 110 TFEU, which prohibits discriminatory internal taxation (see, to that effect, judgments of 15 June 2006, Air Liquide Industries Belgium,

          In that regard, if the advantages stemming from the use of the revenue from a charge forming part of a general system of internal charges applying systematically to national products marketed on the national market and to products exported fully offset the burden borne by the national product marketed on the national market when it is placed on the market, that charge constitutes a charge having an effect equivalent to a customs duty, contrary to Articles 28 and 30 TFEU. On the other hand, if the advantages accruing to the national products processed and marketed on the national market from the use of the revenue generated by the charge offset only partially the burden borne by those products, such a charge will constitute a breach of the prohibition of discrimination laid down by Article 110 TFEU.

          The criterion of whether the burden is offset, in order to be usefully and correctly applied, presupposes a check, during a reference period, on the financial equivalence of the total amounts levied on domestic products sold on the national market in connection with the charge in question and the advantages afforded exclusively to those products. It is therefore for the national court to ascertain that national products marketed on the national market do not in fact derive an exclusive benefit or a proportionally greater benefit than exported national products from the revenue from the charge in dispute, which might offset wholly or in part the burden constituted by that charge (see, to that effect, judgment of 8 June 2006, Koornstra,

          However, by way of exception to the principle of reimbursement of taxes incompatible with European Union law, repayment of a tax wrongly paid can be refused where it would entail unjust enrichment of the persons concerned. The protection of the rights so guaranteed by the legal order of the European Union does not require repayment of taxes, of charges and of duties levied in breach of European Union law where it is established that the person required to pay such charges has actually passed them on to other persons (judgments of 9 November 1983, San Giorgio,

          In such circumstances, the burden of the charge levied but not due has been borne not by the trader, but by the purchaser to whom the cost has been passed on. Therefore, to repay the trader the amount of the charge already received from the purchaser would be tantamount to paying him twice over, which may be described as unjust enrichment, whilst in no way remedying the consequences for the purchaser of the illegality of the charge (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 January 1997, Comateb and Others,

          Since such a refusal of reimbursement of a tax levied on the sale of goods is a limitation of a subjective right derived from the legal order of the European Union, it must be interpreted narrowly. Accordingly, the direct passing on of the tax wrongly levied on the purchaser constitutes the sole exception to the right to reimbursement of tax levied in breach of European Union law (judgment of 6 September 2011, Lady &amp;amp; Kid and Others,

The possible infringement of the obligation, stemming from national legislation, to pass on the charge at issue in the main proceedings onto the final price of the product concerned is irrelevant in that respect.
