        <p class="normal">Indeed, there are differences of interpretation in the case-law of the Supremo Tribunal de Justiça (Supreme Court). One line of case-law has ruled to the effect that the insurance contract is rendered null and void when the policyholder falsely states that he is the owner and usual driver of the vehicle concerned, with the aim of inducing the insurer to conclude an insurance contract against civil liability and/or concluding such a contract on conditions which are less onerous for the insured person. That nullity is based, inter alia, on the fact that the legal condition relating to the policyholder’s ‘interest’, required by Article 428(1) of the Portuguese Commercial Code, is not met. Pursuant to Article 14 of Decree-Law No 522/85, such nullity may, according to that line of case-law, be invoked against the victim. That approach takes account of the fact that the victim will always be protected via the Fundo de Garantia Automóvel.</p>

          That finding is not called in question by the fact that it is possible for the victim to receive compensation from the Fundo de Garantia Automóvel. The payment of compensation by the body referred to in Article 1(4) of the Second Directive was, in fact, designed to be a measure of last resort, envisaged only for cases in which the vehicle that caused the injury or damage has not satisfied the requirement for insurance referred to in Article 3(1) of the First Directive, that is to say, it is a vehicle in respect of which no insurance contract is in place. Such a restriction is explained by the fact that that provision, as recalled in paragraph 23 of the present judgment, requires each Member State to ensure, subject to the derogations allowed under Article 4 of the First Directive, that every owner or keeper of a vehicle normally based in its territory concludes a contract with an insurance company in order to guarantee, up to the limits established by EU law, his civil liability arising as a result of the use of that vehicle (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 July 2013, Csonka and Others,
