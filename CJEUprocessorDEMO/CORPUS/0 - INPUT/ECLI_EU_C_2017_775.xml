Moreover, the non-payment of VAT affects the sales price of the goods and services and confers on the seller a competitive advantage which increases the volume of sales, with the result that the imposition of financial penalties is insufficient to combat VAT evasion.</p>

          In this connection, it should be recalled that, according to settled case-law of the Court, the interpretation which, in the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred on it by Article 267 TFEU, the Court gives to a rule of EU law clarifies and defines the meaning and scope of that rule as it must be or ought to have been understood and applied from the time of its entry into force. It follows that the rule, as thus interpreted, may, and must, be applied by the courts even to legal relationships which arose and were established before the judgment ruling on the request for interpretation, provided that in other respects the conditions for bringing a dispute relating to the application of that rule before the courts having jurisdiction are satisfied (see judgments of 10 May 2012, Santander Asset Management SGIIC and Others,

          It is only quite exceptionally that the Court may, in application of the general principle of legal certainty inherent in the EU legal order, be moved to restrict for any person concerned the opportunity to rely on a provision which it has interpreted with a view to calling into question legal relationships established in good faith. Two essential criteria must be fulfilled before such a limitation can be imposed, namely that those concerned should have acted in good faith and that there should be a risk of serious difficulties (judgments of 10 May 2012, Santander Asset Management SGIIC and Others,

          More specifically, the Court has taken that step only in quite specific circumstances, notably where there was a risk of serious economic repercussions owing in particular to the large number of legal relationships entered into in good faith on the basis of rules considered to be validly in force and where it appeared that individuals and national authorities had been led to adopt practices which did not comply with EU law by reason of objective, significant uncertainty regarding the implications of European Union provisions, to which the conduct of other Member States or the Commission may even have contributed (judgments of 10 May 2012, Santander Asset Management SGIIC and Others,

The closure of such an informal procedure, which is not in any way governed by the provisions of the Treaties, but involves voluntary cooperation between the Commission and the Member States, designed generally both to ensure the correct application of EU law and to resolve, at an early stage, issues arising from that application, does not in any way prejudge the Commission’s ability to institute formal proceedings for failure to fulfil an obligation under Article 258 TFEU. In any event, the Commission’s attitude can in no way, as such, give rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of a Member State as to the compliance of its national rules with EU law where, as in the present case, it is apparent from the case-law that there is no objective and significant uncertainty as to the scope of EU law, in particular the provisions of Directive 2006/112.</p>
