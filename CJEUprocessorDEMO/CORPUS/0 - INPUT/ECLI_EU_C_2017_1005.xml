              <p class="normal">However, under the current measures regarding the security of gas supply that have been taken at Union level, Member States still enjoy a large margin of discretion as to the choice of measures. Where the security of supply of a Member State is threatened, there is a clear risk that measures developed unilaterally by that Member State may jeopardise the proper functioning of the internal gas market and the supply of gas to customers. Recent experience has demonstrated the reality of that risk. In order to allow the internal gas market to function even in the face of a shortage of supply, it is necessary to provide for solidarity and coordination in the response to supply crises, both concerning preventive action and the reaction to concrete disruptions of supply.</p>

The definition of ‘protected customers’ thus adopted in the decree therefore goes beyond the ambit of the definition contained in the regulation. The French authorities maintain, however, that those additional customers correspond to sites of modest size which, even if they belong to large enterprises, share many characteristics with small and medium-sized enterprises. Furthermore, according to those authorities, such a broad definition pertains to the additional obligations which Member States may impose, for reasons of security of gas supply, in accordance with Article 8(2) of that regulation.</p>

The lawfulness of Decree No 2014-328 therefore also depends on whether Article 8(5) of Regulation No 994/2010 prevents a Member State from imposing such obligations on natural gas suppliers.</p>
