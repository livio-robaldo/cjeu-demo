For the latter to be effective, there needs to be one or more identifiable polluters, the damage should be concrete and quantifiable, and a causal link should be established between the damage and the identified polluter(s). Liability is therefore not a suitable instrument for dealing with pollution of a widespread, diffuse character, where it is impossible to link the negative environmental effects with acts or failure to act of certain individual actors.</p>

In cases where a competent authority acts, itself or through a third party, in the place of an operator, that authority should ensure that the cost incurred by it is recovered from the operator. It is also appropriate that the operators should ultimately bear the cost of assessing environmental damage and, as the case may be, assessing an imminent threat of such damage occurring.</p>

          ) and notes that, in order for the environmental liability mechanism implemented by Directive 2004/35 to be effective, the competent authority must establish a causal link between the activity of one or more identifiable operators and concrete and quantifiable damage, irrespective of the type of pollution caused, in order for remedial measures to be required of that operator or those operators. However, in the circumstances of the present case, the referring court maintains that there is no established causal link between TTK and the environmental damage. Therefore, that court maintains that there is no legal basis for imposing an administrative fine on the owner of the land.

          It should be observed as a preliminary point that Article 191(2) TFEU provides that EU policy on the environment is to aim at a high level of protection and is to be based on, inter alia, the polluter-pays principle. That provision thus does no more than define the general environmental objectives of the European Union, since Article 192 TFEU confers on the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union, acting in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, responsibility for deciding what action is to be taken in order to attain those objectives (judgment of 4 March 2015, Fipa Group and Others,

          Consequently, since Article 191(2) TFEU, which establishes the polluter-pays principle, is directed at action at EU level, that provision cannot be relied on as such by individuals in order to exclude the application of national legislation — such as that at issue in the main proceedings — in an area covered by environmental policy for which there is no EU legislation adopted on the basis of Article 192 TFEU that specifically covers the situation in question (see, to that effect, judgments of 9 March 2010, ERG and Others,

          It should be noted that, pursuant to Article 1 of Directive 2004/35, the purpose of that directive is to establish a framework of environmental liability based on the polluter-pays principle with a view to preventing and remedying environmental damage. In the framework of environmental liability laid down by that directive, which is founded on a high degree of environmental protection and on the polluter-pays principle, operators are under a duty both to prevent and to remedy environmental damage (see, to that effect, judgment of 9 March 2010, ERG and Others,

          As is clear from Article 4(5) of Directive 2004/35, that obligation also applies in the context of the fault-based liability system — under which liability arises from fault or negligence on the part of the operator — provided for in Article 3(1)(b) of that directive in respect of occupational activities other than those listed in Annex III thereto (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 March 2015, Fipa Group and Others,

          The particular importance for the application of the polluter-pays principle, and hence for the liability mechanism provided for in Directive 2004/35, of the causal link between the operator’s activity and the environmental damage is also apparent from the provisions of that directive which relate to the inferences to be drawn from the fact that the operator did not contribute to the pollution or to the risk of pollution (judgment of 4 March 2015, Fipa Group and Others,

          In that regard, it should be borne in mind that, under Article 8(3)(a) of Directive 2004/35, read in conjunction with recital 20 thereof, the operator is not required to bear the costs if he can prove that the environmental damage was caused by a third party, and occurred despite the fact that appropriate safety measures were in place, or resulted from an order or instruction emanating from a public authority (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 March 2015, Fipa Group and Others,

          It is apparent from all of the foregoing that the liability mechanism established by Directive 2004/35 is founded on the precautionary principle and on the polluter-pays principle.
