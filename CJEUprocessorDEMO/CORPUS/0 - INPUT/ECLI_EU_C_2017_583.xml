        <p class="normal">In the statements of reasons relating to those acts, the Council described the LTTE as a terrorist group and referred to a number of terrorist acts which the LTTE is said to have carried out from 2005 onwards. It found that, ‘while the recent military defeat of the LTTE has significantly weakened its structure, the likely intention of the organisation is to continue terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka’. In addition, the Council referred, in particular, to two 2001 decisions of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, proscribing the LTTE and freezing their funds (together ‘the UK decisions’), and a decision proscribing the LTTE which was adopted by the Indian authorities in 1992 and confirmed in 2004 (‘the decision of the Indian authorities’). Having noted, with regard to the UK decisions and — only in the grounds for Implementing Regulation No 790/2014 — the decision of the Indian authorities, that these were reviewed regularly or were subject to judicial review or appeal, the Council found that those decisions had been adopted by competent authorities within the meaning of Article 1(4) of Common Position 2001/931. Lastly, the Council noted that those decisions still remained in force and indicated that the reasons for including the LTTE on the list at issue remained valid.</p>

The six pleas common to both cases alleged, respectively: (i) the inapplicability of Regulation No 2580/2001 to the conflict between the LTTE and the Government of Sri Lanka; (ii) the wrongful categorisation of the LTTE as a terrorist organisation for the purposes of Article 1(3) of Common Position 2001/931; (iii) the lack of any decision taken by a competent authority; (iv) failure to undertake the review required under Article 1(6) of Common Position 2001/931; (v) breach of the obligation to state reasons; and (vi) infringement of the applicant entity’s rights of defence and right to effective judicial protection.

In so far as the third State might regard a comment in those statements of reasons on whether or not it complies with the rights of the defence and the right to effective judicial protection as amounting to interference in its internal affairs, the reasoning required by the General Court would prevent the Council from relying on the decisions of third States. The position would be different if the Council were permitted to make its observations on the legal system of the third State concerned in its written pleadings before the Courts of the European Union, where such pleadings would be subject to a certain measure of confidentiality.</p>

          The need for the verification described in paragraph 24 of the present judgment, which is expressly acknowledged by the Council in this appeal, arises, inter alia, from the purpose of the requirement, laid down in Article 1(4) of Common Position 2001/931, that the initial entry of a person or entity on the list at issue be based on a decision adopted by a competent authority. That requirement is designed to protect the persons or entities concerned by ensuring that they are first included on that list only on a sufficiently solid factual basis (see, to that effect, judgment 15 November 2012, Al-Aqsa v Council and Netherlands v Al-Aqsa,

          By contrast, according to the LTTE, the General Court was right to find that if the Council chooses to provide new reasons for their retention on the list at issue, those reasons must be derived from national decisions within the meaning of Article 1(4) of Common Position 2001/931, and not from the press or the internet. The Council’s assertion that it may use open source material to justify maintaining a listing is at odds with the two-tier system established by Common Position 2001/931 and the judgment of 15 November 2012, Al-Aqsa v Council and Netherlands v Al-Aqsa (

          The Court has ruled, with regard to initial decisions on the freezing of funds, that the wording of Article 1(4) of Common Position 2001/931 refers to the decision taken by a national authority by requiring that precise information or evidence in the file exists which shows that such a decision has been taken. That requirement seeks to ensure that, in the absence of any means at the disposal of the European Union that would enable it to carry out its own investigations regarding the involvement of a person or entity in terrorist acts, the Council’s decision on the initial listing is taken on a sufficient factual basis enabling the Council to conclude that there is a danger that, if preventive measures are not taken, the person or entity concerned may continue to be involved in terrorist activities (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 November 2012, Al-Aqsa v Council and Netherlands v Al‑Aqsa,

          As regards, on the other hand, subsequent fund-freezing decisions, it is apparent from the case-law of the Court that the essential question when reviewing whether to continue to include a person or entity on the list at issue is whether, since the inclusion of that person or that entity on that list or since the last review, the factual situation has changed in such a way that it is no longer possible to draw the same conclusion in relation to the involvement of that person or entity in terrorist activities (judgment of 15 November 2012, Al-Aqsa v Council and Netherlands v Al-Aqsa,

In paragraphs 187 and 204 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court held that the reference to any new terrorist act which the Council inserts in its statement of reasons during a review pursuant to Article 1(6) of Common Position 2001/931 must have been the subject of an examination and a national decision by a competent authority. Having found, notably in paragraphs 186 and 207 of the judgment under appeal, that the Council had based its allegations concerning terrorist acts which the LTTE is said to have committed from 2005 onwards not on such decisions but on information which it obtained from articles in the press and on the internet, the General Court accordingly annulled the acts at issue.</p>

In addition, as the Council mentioned in the statements of reasons relating to the acts at issue, the LTTE incurred a military defeat, announced by the Sri Lankan Government in May 2009, which significantly weakened that organisation. The Council was therefore obliged to base the retention of the LTTE on that list on more recent material demonstrating that there was still a risk that the LTTE were involved in terrorist activities. Consequently, contrary to what is claimed by the Council, the General Court did not err in law in considering, at least implicitly, that the UK decisions did not in themselves constitute a sufficient basis for the acts at issue.</p>

As is apparent from paragraph 168 of that judgment, the period covered by that list extends, according to the contested regulations, to April 2009 or June 2010. It is evident from the documents submitted to the Court of Justice that, while the statements of reasons relating to the first and second implementing regulations at issue, that is to say, Implementing Regulations No 83/2011 and No 687/2011 (together ‘the first and second implementing regulations at issue’), mentioned three alleged terrorist acts which it is claimed the LTTE committed between 27 April and 12 June 2010 and thus after their military defeat in May 2009, the Council subsequently amended the statement of reasons for the acts at issue by removing any reference to those three acts in the statements of reasons relating to the third to eighth implementing regulations at issue, that is to say, Implementing Regulations No 1375/2011, No 542/2012, No 1169/2012, No 714/2013, No 125/2014 and No 790/2014 (together ‘the third to eighth implementing regulations at issue’). The last terrorist act referred to in the statements of reasons relating to the third to eighth implementing regulations at issue dates from 12 April 2009 and thus pre-dates that military defeat. In its written replies to the questions put by the General Court, the Council explained that that amendment was an ‘update’ of the statements of reasons relating to the acts at issue, which had to be made because new information was obtained.</p>

In view of the fact that that military defeat represented a significant change in circumstances, one that was capable of calling in question the ongoing nature of the risk of the LTTE’s involvement in terrorist activities, the Council should have referred to the evidence supporting that assessment in those statements of reasons. Consequently, the third to eighth implementing regulations at issue are vitiated by a failure to give sufficient reasons that is capable of leading to their annulment.</p>

That update resulted in the removal of references to the three alleged terrorist acts which it is claimed the LTTE committed between 27 April and 12 June 2010 and thus after the LTTE’s military defeat. Nor, moreover, has the Council referred to those three alleged terrorist acts in the context of the present appeal, despite a question from this Court as to whether the grounds for the acts at issue are sufficient as regards the likely intention of the LTTE to continue terrorist attacks in Sri Lanka, notwithstanding their military defeat in May 2009.
