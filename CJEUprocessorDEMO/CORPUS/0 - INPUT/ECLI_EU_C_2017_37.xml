As regards the case in the main proceedings, it follows that the WETS is not applicable in the case in the main proceedings since the judgment of the Hof van beroep Antwerpen (Court of Appeal, Antwerp) was issued on 28 February 2011 and, therefore, the referring court has jurisdiction to rule on the request made by the Belgian authorities.</p>

        <p class="normal">In order to answer that question, it must be recalled, first of all, that Article 1(a) of the Framework Decision 2008/909 defines a ‘judgment’ as a final decision or order of a court of the issuing State imposing a sentence on a natural person. Under Article 3(1) thereof, that framework decision is intended to lay down rules enabling a Member State, with a view to facilitating the social rehabilitation of the sentenced person, to recognise a judgment and enforce the sentence. According to Article 3(3) of the Framework Decision, the latter applies only to the recognition of judgments and the enforcement of sentences within the meaning of that framework decision.</p>

          Next, it must be observed that, according to settled case-law, the need for a uniform application of EU law and the principle of equality require that the terms of a provision of EU law which makes no express reference to the law of the Member States for the purpose of determining its meaning and scope must normally be given an independent and uniform interpretation throughout the European Union (judgment of 28 July 2016,

          Article 1(a) of Framework Decision 2008/909, which defines the concept of ‘judgment’ as a final decision, does not contain any reference to the law of the Member States, so that it must be held that that concept is an autonomous concept of EU law that must be given an autonomous and uniform interpretation throughout the European Union. To that end, account must also be taken of the terms of that provision, its context and the objectives of the legislation of which it forms part (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 July 2016,
          <span class="italic">JZ</span>
          , C‑294/16 PPU, EU:2016:610, paragraph 37).

        <p class="normal">In that connection, although the terms of Article 28(2) of the Framework Decision 2008/909 are ambiguous, the reference made in that provision to a ‘final judgment’ militates in favour of an interpretation according to which that provision covers the latter judgment which is issued in criminal proceedings and which makes final the sentence imposed on the person sentenced. That interpretation is supported by the definition of ‘judgment’ in Article 1(a) thereof. In that connection, the fact that both Article 1(a) and Article 28(2) refer to the ‘final’ nature of the judgment concerned underlines the particular importance, for the purpose of the application of the latter provision, given to the unchallengeable nature of that judgment and, therefore, the date on which finality is acquired.</p>
