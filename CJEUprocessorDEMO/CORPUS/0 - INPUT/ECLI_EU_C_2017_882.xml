It claims that the assumption that the constituents of a substance dissolve in water is inherent in the summation method. Applying that method, it would therefore be presumed that the constituents are entirely soluble because their solubility would already be integrated at an earlier stage during the assessment of their toxicity. The fact that the 16 constituents taken into account in the present case represent only 9.2% of CTPHT is irrelevant, since it is not necessary, when using that method, to take into account either a large number of constituents or that the constituents taken into account represent a significant proportion of the substance. It is important only to ascertain, using the summation method, whether the thresholds set by Regulation No 1272/2008 are met, without the Commission having any margin of discretion whatsoever in that regard. The General Court therefore erred in law in criticising the Commission for not taking into consideration factors that are not prescribed by the summation method referred to in point 4.1.3.5.5 of Annex I to Regulation No 1272/2008.</p>

        <p class="normal">The classification method referred to in point 4.1.3.5.5 of Annex I to Regulation No 1272/2008 is based on the assumption that the constituents taken into consideration are 100% soluble. On the basis of that assumption, that summation method implies that there is a concentration level of constituents below which the threshold of 25% cannot be reached and, thus, consists of calculating the sum of the concentrations of the constituents coming within the categories of acute or chronic toxicity, each weighted by factor M corresponding to their toxicity profile.</p>

In such situations, it thus becomes possible that the summation method may lead, in specific cases, to a result greater than or less than the level corresponding to the regulatory threshold of 25%, according to whether the hypothetical solubility rate of the constituents is taken into consideration or that of the substance as a whole.</p>

Nor is it disputed that it is, moreover, apparent from point 1.3 of that document, entitled ‘Physiochemical properties’, that the maximum rate of water solubility of CTPHT was 0.0014%, a rate approximately 71000 times lower than the hypothetical solubility rate of 100% used for the constituents taken into consideration.</p>

This, it submits, is very complex evidence that justifies the application of the summation method. The General Court, in paragraph 34 of the judgment under appeal, took from that vast set of scientific and technical evidence only the sentence according to which 9.2% of CTPHT could dissolve in water in order to invalidate the Commission’s assessment. However, according to the Commission, that factor is inherent in the summation method. By holding, in that paragraph 34, that the maximum solubility rate of CTPHT as a whole is 0.0014%, the General Court substituted its own assessment for that of the Commission. Furthermore, by doing so, the General Court distorted the evidence on the basis of which the regulation at issue had been adopted.</p>

According to the settled case-law on the scope of judicial review, recalled in paragraph 35 above, the General Court’s assessment, based on the data in the background document annexed to the RAC’s opinion, focused exclusively on the procedural question of determining whether the Commission, in classifying CTPHT, complied with its obligation to take into consideration all the relevant factors and circumstances.</p>
