Accordingly, it was entitled to entertain the same expectations as Beta-Trans as regards the new areas to be allocated, and the decision by which SEA awarded the area in question, which was originally intended to be used as a hangar, directly to Beta-Trans, without any tendering procedure, caused it to suffer loss.</p>

Moreover, according to SEA and Beta-Trans, Malpensa Logistica Europa already had at its disposal a storage area of approximately 18000 square metres, as well as two covered areas of 2700 and 3227 square metres, respectively, for the temporary storage of cargo where it could be protected in bad weather.</p>

Moreover, the activity pursued by SEA falls within the category of activities relating to the exploitation of a geographical area for the purpose of the provision of airports to air carriers, in accordance with Article 7 of Directive 2004/17. That court explains that, according to national case-law, the exploitation of airport areas (geographical areas), including, therefore, internal areas, in connection with the activities usually performed by air carriers falls within the material scope of the rules governing special sectors.</p>
