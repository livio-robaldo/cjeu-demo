According to the Commission, full communication of that information would permit the public, and in particular the undertakings concerned, to raise questions or make criticisms in respect of the information communicated by the Member States, which would be likely to interfere in the decision-making process.

In the circumstances, the priority interests were to ensure that decisions were taken without any external interference and to preserve the climate of trust between the Commission and the German authorities. Furthermore, the Commission noted that a substantial proportion of the requested information had already been made public by the German authorities and stated that the public therefore had access to the main elements of the proposed harmonised free allocation of emission allowances.</p>

That criticism serves precisely the objectives pursued by those rules, in particular better decision-making in environmental matters on the basis of information put to public scrutiny.

Next, in so far as the first ground of appeal could be construed as criticising the General Court for having disregarded the requirement to interpret the exception provided for in the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001 in the light of the concept of the expression ‘proceedings of public authorities’ set out in Article 4(4)(a) of the Aarhus Convention, it is based on an argument which was not put forward or debated before the General Court.

Firstly, the wording of both Article 4(4)(a) of the Aarhus Convention and Article 4(2)(a) of Directive 2003/4 refer not to ‘internal proceedings’ but simply ‘proceedings’ of public authorities. Moreover, given that, like the Union, all Member States are party to the Aarhus Convention, it may be presumed that the EU legislature did not intend that Directive 2003/4 should place substantively different obligations on Member States than those imposed on EU bodies by Regulations Nos 1049/2001 and 1367/2006.</p>

Consequently, even if a document does not divulge a public authority’s internal proceedings but only the factors that served as a basis for the adoption of its decision, access to that document could be refused under the latter provision.</p>

          As a preliminary observation, it should be noted that, in accordance with the first recital of Regulation No 1049/2001, that regulation reflects the intention expressed in the second paragraph of Article 1 of the EU Treaty — inserted by the Treaty of Amsterdam — of marking a new stage in the process of creating an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe, in which decisions are taken as openly as possible and as closely as possible to the citizen. As is stated in recital 2 in the preamble to Regulation No 1049/2001, the right of public access to documents of the institutions is related to the democratic nature of those institutions (judgment of 1 July 2008, Sweden and Turco v Council,

Thus, the mere reference to a risk of negative repercussions linked to access to internal documents and the possibility that interested parties may influence the procedure do not suffice to prove that disclosure of those documents would seriously undermine the decision-making process of the institution concerned.</p>

In those circumstances, it cannot therefore be held that such disclosure jeopardises compliance with time limits in administrative procedures conducted by the Commission.</p>

          Lastly, it should be borne in mind that, although the administrative activity of the Commission does not require as extensive an access to documents as that concerning the legislative activity of a Union institution, that does not in any way mean that such an activity falls outside the scope of Regulation No 1049/2001 which, as provided in Article 2(3) thereof, applies to all documents held by an institution, that is to say drawn up or received by it and in its possession, in all areas of Union activity (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 July 2011, Sweden v MyTravel and Commission,
