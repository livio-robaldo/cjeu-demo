          Fourth, it is also clear from the Court’s case-law that Directive 2003/88 treats the right to annual leave and to a payment on that account as being two aspects of a single right.

          It is true that Directive 2003/88 contains no provisions on judicial remedies available to the worker, in the case of a dispute with his employer, to enforce his right to paid annual leave under that directive. However, it is not disputed that the Member States must, in such a context, ensure compliance with the right to an effective remedy, as enshrined in Article 47 of the Charter (see, by analogy, judgment of 15 September 2016, Star Storage and Others,

Following the same logic, regulation 30(1) of those regulations recognises workers’ right to two separate judicial remedies, the worker being able to bring an action before a court either to contest the refusal by his employer to recognise his right to a period of annual leave under regulation 13, or to argue that his employer has not paid him for all or part of that leave pursuant to regulation 16.</p>

          Thus, in the specific circumstances in which a worker is unfit for work for several consecutive holiday years, the Court has held that, having regard not only to the protection of workers as pursued by Directive 2003/88, but also the protection of employers faced with the risk that a worker will accumulate periods of absence of too great a length and the difficulties in the organisation of work which such periods might entail, Article 7 of that directive must be interpreted as not precluding national provisions or practices limiting, by a carry-over period of 15 months at the end of which the right to paid annual leave is lost, the accumulation of entitlements to such leave by a worker who has been unfit for work for several consecutive holiday years (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 November 2011, KHS,

Thus, any derogation from the European Union system for the organisation of working time put in place by Directive 2003/88 must be interpreted in such a way that its scope is limited to what is strictly necessary in order to safeguard the interests which that derogation protects (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 October 2010, Union syndicale Solidaires Isère,

          ), the European Union system for the organisation of working time put in place by Directive 2003/88 may not be interpreted restrictively. Indeed, if it were to be accepted, in that context, that the worker’s acquired entitlement to paid annual leave could be extinguished, that would amount to validating conduct by which an employer was unjustly enriched to the detriment of the very purpose of that directive, which is that there should be due regard for workers’ health.
