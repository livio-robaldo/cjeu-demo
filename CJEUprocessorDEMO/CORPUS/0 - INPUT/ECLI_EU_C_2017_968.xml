          In that regard, it should be noted that, according to the Court’s settled case-law, it follows from Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union that the General Court has exclusive jurisdiction, first, to establish the facts, except where the substantive inaccuracy of its findings is apparent from the documents submitted to it, and, secondly, to assess those facts. When the General Court has established or assessed the facts, the Court of Justice has jurisdiction under Article 256 TFEU to review the legal characterisation of those facts by the General Court and the legal conclusions it has drawn from them. The Court of Justice thus has no jurisdiction to establish the facts or, in principle, to examine the evidence which the General Court accepted in support of those facts. Save where the clear sense of the evidence has been distorted, that appraisal does not therefore constitute a point of law which is subject as such to review by the Court of Justice (judgment of 10 July 2008, Bertelsmann and Sony Corporation of America v Impala,

Initially, the information required was the bare minimum necessary to enable those institutions to obtain a complete and accurate picture of the Giant group and of the related companies. The data provided by Giant was insufficient for the purpose of creating such a picture. Second, EBMA submits that the General Court erred in imposing an excessive burden on the Commission by asking it to demonstrate how the information it sought in connection with the related companies was necessary. Third, EBMA maintains that, in view of the broad discretion enjoyed by the Council and the Commission in anti-dumping proceedings, the General Court cannot take the place of the Council by finding that conclusions have been drawn from partial evidence.</p>

Furthermore, Article 5(11) of that regulation provides that the Commission is to advise, inter alia, the exporters, importers and representative associations of importers or exporters known to it to be concerned, of the initiation of the investigation. Moreover, it is apparent from Article 6(2) of the regulation that a questionnaire is prepared by the Commission’s staff for the purpose of obtaining the information necessary for the investigation. That questionnaire is sent to the interested parties, which, as a rule, have 30 days within which to reply.</p>

          In the third place, the definition of the term ‘necessary information’ must take account of the objective of Article 18 of the basic regulation.

However, no provision in the basic regulation confers on the Commission any power to compel the interested parties to participate in the investigation or to provide information. The Commission is therefore reliant on the voluntary cooperation of those parties in supplying the necessary information (see, by analogy, judgment of 4 September 2014, Simon, Evers &amp;amp; Co.,

          It must be observed in that regard that, according to the Court’s case-law, in the sphere of the common commercial policy and, most particularly, in the realm of measures to protect trade, the EU institutions enjoy broad discretion by reason of the complexity of the economic, political and legal situations which they have to examine. The judicial review of such discretion must therefore be limited to verifying whether the procedural rules have been complied with, whether the facts on which the contested choice is based have been accurately stated, and whether there has been a manifest error in the appraisal of those facts or a misuse of powers (judgment of 16 February 2012, Council and Commission v Interpipe Niko Tube and Interpipe NTRP,

          The Court of Justice has also held that the General Court’s review of the evidence on which the EU institutions based their findings does not constitute a new assessment of the facts replacing that of the institutions. That review does not encroach on the broad discretion of the institutions in the field of commercial policy, but is restricted to showing whether that evidence was able to support the conclusions reached by the institutions. The General Court must therefore not only establish whether the evidence put forward is factually accurate, reliable and consistent but also ascertain whether that evidence contained all the relevant information which had to be taken into account in order to assess a complex situation and whether it was capable of substantiating the conclusions reached (judgment of 26 January 2016, Maxcom v City Cycle Industries,

          Secondly, according to EBMA, where companies are related, such as the Giant and Jinshan groups, there is always a risk of circumvention if one related entity is granted a lower anti-dumping duty than another entity belonging to the same group. That is why the established practice of the European Union is to impose anti-dumping duty at group level, not at entity level. Therefore, paragraph 83 of the judgment under appeal, which refers to the theoretical risk of circumvention between unrelated entities, is fundamentally flawed and incorrect as a matter of law, as circumvention is more likely to occur and more difficult to detect between related companies. Furthermore, according to EBMA, paragraph 84 of the judgment under appeal misses the point. The Panel Report and the Appellate Body Report of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body cited in that paragraph concern whether Article 9(5) of the basic regulation is consistent with Article 9.2 of the Agreement on the implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 (
