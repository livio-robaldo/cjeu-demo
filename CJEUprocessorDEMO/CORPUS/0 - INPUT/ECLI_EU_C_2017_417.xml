          In that context, it must nevertheless be noted that the Court has held that, in addition to the customs debt, there may also be a requirement to pay VAT in the case where, on the basis of the particular unlawful conduct which gave rise to the customs debt, it can be presumed that the goods entered the economic network of the European Union and, consequently, that they may have undergone consumption, that is, the act on which VAT is levied (judgment of 2 June 2016, Eurogate Distribution and DHL Hub Leipzig,

          It must, however, be noted that, as is apparent from its wording, Article 204 of the Customs Code applies only in cases not covered by Article 203 of that code. Accordingly, in order to determine which of those two articles causes a customs debt to be incurred, it is necessary, as a matter of priority, to consider whether in the factual situation in question there was removal from customs supervision for the purposes of Article 203(1) of the Customs Code. Only if that question is answered in the negative is it possible that Article 204 of the Customs Code may apply (judgment of 12 February 2004, Hamann International,
