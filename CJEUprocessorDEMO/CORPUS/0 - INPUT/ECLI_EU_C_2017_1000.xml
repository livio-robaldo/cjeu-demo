Mantovani further stated that, in order to fully and effectively dissociate the company from Mr B.’s actions, the latter was immediately removed from his management role in the Mantovani group, the management bodies of the company had been reorganised, Mr B.’s shares had been bought back and an action for damages had been brought against him.</p>

The ANAC replied, in essence, that although, in the absence of a final judgment, Mantovani’s statement could not be classified as a ‘misrepresentation’, the lack of timely notification of criminal proceedings concerning one of the persons mentioned in Article 38(1)(c) of Legislative Decree No 163/2006 may constitute an infringement of the obligation of sincere cooperation with the contracting authority, and accordingly impede the full and effective dissociation from the person concerned.</p>

According to the minutes of that meeting, it was found that the general requirements laid down in Article 38 of Legislative Decree No 163/2006 were not met ‘because of the late and inadequate information provided by the company in order to prove that it had dissociated itself from the criminal conduct of the person having ceased to perform management functions’ and that the conviction ‘was handed down prior to the statement submitted in the tender procedure and could, as such, have been notified by Mantovani at the stage when its participation was being assessed’.</p>

        <p class="normal">However, as noted by the Advocate General in points 54 and 58 of his Opinion, EU law is based on the premiss that legal persons act through their representatives. Conduct contrary to the professional ethics of those representatives may thus constitute a relevant factor in assessing the professional conduct of an undertaking. It is thus perfectly permissible for Member States to retain, as part of the exercise of their powers to determine the requirements governing the application of the optional grounds for exclusion, among the relevant factors in assessing the integrity of the tendering company, the possibility that certain actions of directors of that company are contrary to professional ethics.</p>

There is therefore nothing to preclude Member States, when implementing the ground for exclusion laid down in Article 45(2)(c) of Directive 2004/18, from considering that acts of a director representing the tendering company are imputable to that company.</p>
