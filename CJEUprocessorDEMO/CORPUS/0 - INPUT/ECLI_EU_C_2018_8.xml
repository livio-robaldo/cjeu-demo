In response to a request for clarification from the Court, on 2 June 2017, the Korkein hallinto-oikeus (Supreme Administrative Court) stated that, with effect from 24 January 2016, the prison sentence imposed on E had been commuted to a suspended sentence, and that since then he had not been subject to any measures involving a deprivation of liberty. In those circumstances, on 8 June 2017, on the proposition of the Judge-Rapporteur, after hearing the Advocate General, the Fifth Chamber decided not to accede to the request of that court.</p>

Furthermore, if the second State considers that it is appropriate to maintain the residence permit it issued, that gives rise to an obligation which is also a clear, precise and unconditional on the first State to withdraw the alert for the purpose of refusing entry and, if necessary, to convert it into an alert on its national list.</p>
