In that regard, the referring court points out, in particular, that, in its view, the present case is distinguishable from those giving rise to the case-law of the Court relating to employees whose rights were affected immediately after the transfer of their post and not, more than one year after the transfer, following the expiry of a transitional protection period.</p>

          As the Court has consistently held, that directive is intended to safeguard the rights of employees in the event of a change of employer by allowing them to continue to work for the transferee employer on the same conditions as those agreed with the transferor (see, for example, judgment of 27 November 2008, Juuri,
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2008%3A656&amp;locale=en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch" hreflang="en" class="CourtLink">C‑396/07</a>

          and the case-law cited). The purpose of that directive is to ensure, as far as possible, that the contract of employment or employment relationship continues unchanged with the transferee, in order to prevent the workers concerned from being placed in a less favourable position solely as a result of the transfer (see judgment of 6 September 2011, Scattolon,

          With regard to Article 3 of Directive 2001/23, the Court has stated that the objective of that directive is also to ensure a fair balance between the interests of the employees, on the one hand, and those of the transferee, on the other. It follows from this, inter alia, that the transferee must be in a position to make the adjustments and changes necessary to carry on its operations (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 September 2014, Österreichischer Gewerkschaftsbund,

          More specifically, the Court has previously ruled on questions of the recognition of length of service in the case of a transfer of an undertaking for the purposes of calculating financial rights of transferred employees within the meaning of that directive (see judgments of 14 September 2000, Collino and Chiappero,

          In those judgments, the Court held that, while length of service with the transferors is not in itself a right that the transferred employees may assert against the transferee, the fact nonetheless remains that, in certain cases, it is used to determine certain financial rights of employees, and that those rights must then, in principle, continue to be observed by the transferee in the same way as they were observed by the transferor (see judgment of 6 September 2011, Scattolon,

          Thus, while recalling that the transferee may, on a ground other than the transfer of undertakings and in so far as national law so allows, alter the conditions of remuneration in a manner unfavourable to employees, the Court has held that the first subparagraph of Article 3(1) of Council Directive 77/187/EEC of 14 February 1977 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees’ rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of businesses (

          ), the wording of which is essentially identical to that of the first subparagraph of Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/23, must be interpreted as meaning that, in calculating rights of a financial nature, the transferee must take into account the entire length of service of the employees transferred, in so far as his obligation to do so derives from the employment relationship between those employees and the transferor, and in accordance with the terms agreed in that relationship (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 September 2000, Collino and Chiappero,
