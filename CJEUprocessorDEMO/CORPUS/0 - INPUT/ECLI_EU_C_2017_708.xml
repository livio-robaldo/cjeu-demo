Employees of A. Falkiewicz Specialist Hospital have the same legal status as employees of private establishments and are not covered by civil service law.

          That conclusion is all the more compelling since the purpose of the obligation to hold consultations, set out in Article 2 of that directive — namely, to avoid terminations of contracts of employment or to reduce their number and to mitigate the consequences (judgment of 10 September 2009, Akavan Erityisalojen Keskusliitto AEK and Others,

Where a decision involving the amendment of conditions of employment could help to avoid collective redundancies, the consultation procedure provided for in Article 2 of that directive must begin once the employer intends to make such amendments (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 September 2009, Akavan Erityisalojen Keskusliitto AEK and Others,
