The General Court held that, having regard, in particular, to the fact that the 2002 decision contained no reference to Article 3 or Article 15(2) of Regulation No 17, the decision was based on Article 65(4) and (5) CS alone … Since those provisions had expired on 23 July 2002, the Commission could no longer derive competence from those provisions, which were no longer in force when it adopted the 2002 decision, in order to establish an infringement of Article 65(1) CS and to impose fines on the undertakings which had allegedly participated in the infringement …

Since the undertakings concerned had the right to be heard, as the Commission’s letter of 30 June 2008 inviting them to submit their comments confirmed, the Commission should have implemented all the procedural steps provided for by Regulation No 773/2004 — namely, notification of a new statement of objections and the opportunity for the undertakings to exercise their right of access to the case file, as well as their right to an oral hearing upon request.</p>

The Commission contends that the change to the legal basis as regards its power to impose fines had no effect on Feralpi’s position, and that the latter had the opportunity, in response to the supplementary statement of objections, to make its views known both on the upper limit of the fine the Commission could impose and on the legal basis authorising the Commission to do so.</p>

It cannot be considered, however, that that letter served as the statement of objections in the strict sense. According to the Commission, the General Court correctly found that, since the annulment of the 2002 decision did not affect the validity of the statement of objections and supplementary statement of objections, on which the undertakings concerned had already had the opportunity to express their opinion, the Commission could simply inform them, in the aforementioned letter, of its intention to re-adopt that decision on a new legal basis.</p>

After expiry of the ECSC Treaty, on 12 August 2002 the Commission sent the undertakings the supplementary statement of objections based on Article 19(1) of Regulation No 17, in which it explained its position regarding the change in the legal framework and invited them to make known their own points of view on the supplementary statement of objections.

          Having regard to the fact that more than fourteen years elapsed between the verifications being carried out by the Commission during the year 2000 and the delivery of the judgment under appeal, Feralpi asks that, for the sake of judicial efficiency and despite the approach taken by the Court in the judgment of 26 November 2013, Gascogne Sack Deutschland v Commission (

          ), it be awarded a compensatory remedy by the Court at the judgment stage for the harm caused by the failure to observe the reasonable time requirement. In the alternative, Feralpi asks the Court to declare that the General Court misinterpreted the second paragraph of Article 47 of the Charter, which constituted a sufficiently serious breach of a rule of law intended to confer rights on individuals.

          In respect of Feralpi’s request to the Court to grant it a compensatory remedy for harm allegedly caused by a breach, on the part of the General Court, of the second paragraph of Article 47 of the Charter, or to declare such a breach, it should be recalled that a breach by a Court of the European Union of its obligation under that provision to adjudicate on the cases before it within a reasonable time must be sanctioned in an action for damages brought before the General Court, since such an action constitutes an effective remedy. Accordingly, a claim for compensation for the damage caused by the failure on the part of the General Court to adjudicate within a reasonable time may not be made directly to the Court of Justice in the context of an appeal, but must be brought before the General Court itself. The General Court, which has jurisdiction under Article 256(1) TFEU, hearing a claim for damages, is required to rule on such a claim sitting in a different composition from that which heard the dispute which gave rise to the procedure whose duration is criticised (judgment of 9 June 2016, Repsol Lubricantes y Especialidades and Others v Commission,
