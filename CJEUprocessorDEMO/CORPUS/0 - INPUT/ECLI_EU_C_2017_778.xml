The Minister therefore was of the opinion that the purchase and sale agreements concluded between companies G and K, as well as between companies K and F, as well as the contracts concluded between the related companies D, F and G, involved fictitious transactions. Consequently, the Minister took the view that the price invoiced to G by the original South American suppliers was to be the basis for the calculation of the cif import price and any additional duties due.</p>
