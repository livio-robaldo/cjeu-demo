Those changes will occur only if biofuels and bioliquids meeting those criteria command a price premium compared to those that do not. According to the mass balance method of verifying compliance, there is a physical link between the production of biofuels and bioliquids meeting the sustainability criteria and the consumption of biofuels and bioliquids in the Community, providing an appropriate balance between supply and demand and ensuring a price premium that is greater than in systems where there is no such link. To ensure that biofuels and bioliquids meeting the sustainability criteria can be sold at a higher price, the mass balance method should therefore be used to verify compliance. This should maintain the integrity of the system while at the same time avoiding the imposition of an unreasonable burden on industry. Other verification methods should, however, be reviewed.</p>

That sister company adds those consignments to the German gas distribution network at a clearly identified point.

          By the expression ‘measures for the approximation’ in that provision, the authors of the FEU Treaty intended to confer on the EU legislature a discretion, depending on the general context and the specific circumstances of the matter to be harmonised, as regards the method of approximation most appropriate for achieving the desired result, in particular in fields with complex technical features. It was thus open to the EU legislature, in the exercise of that discretion, to proceed towards harmonisation only in stages and to require only the gradual abolition of unilateral measures adopted by the Member States (see, inter alia, judgment of 4 May 2016, Philip Morris Brands and Others,

As has just been stated, the aim of that article is merely, by their harmonisation, to regulate the conditions relating to sustainability which must be fulfilled by biofuels in order for them to be taken into account by a Member State for the three specific purposes set out in Article 17(1) of that directive.

In accordance with those points, such a system must therefore, first, allow consignments of raw material or biofuel with differing sustainability characteristics to be mixed, secondly, require information about the sustainability characteristics and sizes of those consignments to remain assigned to the mixture and, thirdly, provide for the sum of all consignments withdrawn from the mixture to be described as having the same sustainability characteristics, in the same quantities, as the sum of all consignments added to the mixture.</p>

On the contrary, it follows from those points that the Member States retain a discretion and latitude when they are required to determine, more precisely, the specific conditions which the mass balance systems to be put into place by the economic operators must fulfil. Accordingly, nor is such a provision, viewed thusly, such as to lead, automatically, to a guarantee of free movement of sustainable biogas over a cross-border gas network once that biogas has lawfully been designated sustainable in the Member State of production.</p>

          Thus, when there are obstacles to trade, or it is likely that such obstacles will emerge in the future, because the Member States have taken, or are about to take, divergent measures with respect to a product or a class of products such as to bring about different levels of protection, Article 114 TFEU authorises the EU legislature to intervene by adopting appropriate measures, in compliance with Article 114(3) TFEU and with the legal principles referred to in the FEU Treaty or identified in the case-law, in particular the principle of proportionality (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 May 2016, Philip Morris Brands and Others,

          Moreover, with regard to judicial review of the conditions referred to in the previous paragraph, it must also be borne in mind that the EU legislature must be allowed a broad discretion when it is called upon to legislate in an area which entails political, economic and social choices on its part, and in which it is called upon to undertake complex assessments. The lawfulness of a measure adopted in that sphere can be affected only if the measure is manifestly inappropriate in relation to the objective which the competent institutions are seeking to pursue (see, to that effect, in the sphere of the protection of health, judgments of 14 December 2004, Swedish Match,

In accordance with that recital, such a physical link has been favoured as being able to create a balance between supply and demand and ensure a price premium for sustainable biofuel that is sufficiently greater to bring about, in the conduct of actors on the market, the necessary changes, and so to ensure the very usefulness of the sustainability criteria. In that recital 76, the EU legislature has, furthermore, also pointed out that the application of the mass balance system to verify compliance should maintain the integrity of the system while at the same time avoiding the imposition of an unreasonable burden on industry.</p>

Article 18(2) of Directive 2009/28 thus provides that the Commission is to report on the operation of the mass balance verification method and on the potential for allowing for other verification methods, particularly those in which information about characteristics need not remain physically assigned to particular consignments or mixtures, taking into account the need to maintain the integrity and effectiveness of the verification system while avoiding the imposition of an unreasonable burden on undertakings. In that regard, the Commission concluded that it was appropriate to maintain the mass balance method (see, in particular, Commission Staff Working Document: Report on the operation of the mass balance verification method for the biofuels and bioliquids sustainability scheme in accordance with Article 18(2) of Directive 2009/28/EC (SEC/2010/0129 final)).</p>

Paragraph 14 of the hållbarhetsförordningen, intended to provide such a transposition, reproduces, on the one hand, the three general criteria set out in Article 18(1)(a), (b) and (c) and provides, on the other, that the SE may adopt additional provisions as regards the verification system and the monitoring thereof.
