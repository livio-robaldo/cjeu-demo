In support of their claim, they pleaded that the short period between the vaccination and the appearance of the first symptoms of multiple sclerosis, in conjunction with the lack of any personal or family history of the disease, are such as to give rise to serious, specific and consistent presumptions as to the existence of a defect in the vaccine and as to there being a causal link between the injection of the vaccine and the occurrence of the multiple sclerosis.</p>

The cour d’appel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) observed, firstly, that there was no scientific consensus supporting a causal relationship between the vaccination against hepatitis B and multiple sclerosis and that all the national and international health authorities had rejected the association between a likelihood of being affected by central or peripheral demyelinating disease (characteristic of multiple sclerosis) and the vaccination against hepatitis B. It considered, secondly, that according to multiple medical studies the aetiology of multiple sclerosis is currently unknown. Thirdly, a recent medical publication concluded that, at the time when the first symptoms of multiple sclerosis appear, the pathophysiological process probably commenced many months, or many years earlier. Fourthly and lastly, that court noted that epidemiological studies show that 92 to 95% of persons with multiple sclerosis had no antecedent of the disease in their family. In the light of those various elements, the cour d’appel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) concluded that the criteria relating to temporal proximity between the vaccination and the first symptoms and the lack of personal and family antecedents relied on by W and Others could not, together or separately, establish serious, specific and consistent presumptions supporting the conclusion of there being a causal link between the vaccination and the disease in question.</p>

          As observed by the Advocate General in point 45 of his Opinion, such a high evidentiary standard, which amounts to excluding any method of proof other than certain proof based on medical research, could make it excessively difficult in many situations or, as in the present case, where it is common ground that medical research neither confirms nor rules out the existence of such a causal link, impossible to establish producer liability, thereby undermining the effectiveness of Article 1 of Directive 85/374 (see, by analogy, judgment of 9 November 1983, San Giorgio,

          Although, as shown by the discussion in paragraphs 28 to 32 of this judgment, national evidentiary rules such as those described in paragraph 28 above, which are ostensibly neutral as to the burden of proof referred to in Article 4 of Directive 85/374 and, in principle, capable of preserving the effectiveness of the system of liability provided for by that directive whilst ensuring compliance with the objectives pursued by it, the fact remains that the actual scope of such rules must be determined in the light of the interpretation and application given to them by national courts (see, by analogy, judgment of 9 December 2003, Commission v Italy,

          As observed by the Advocate General in points 54, 60 and 75 of his Opinion, that could arise firstly in a situation where national courts apply those evidentiary rules in an overly rigorous manner by accepting irrelevant or insufficient evidence (see, by analogy, judgment of 15 October 2015, Nike European Operations Netherlands,

          ). In such a situation, there would be disregard not only of the rule on burden of proof laid down in Article 4 of Directive 85/374 but also, more generally, the effectiveness of the system of liability introduced by Article 1 of that directive, since the issue whether two of the three conditions on which producer’s liability under that directive is contingent, namely the existence of a defect in the product and a causal link between that defect and the damage suffered by the victim, were met would not be sufficiently examined by the national court.

          Secondly, disregard of the burden of proof could also result if the national courts were to apply the evidentiary rules described in paragraph 28 of this judgment in such a way that, where one or more types of factual evidence were presented together, an immediate and automatic presumption would operate of there being a defect in the product and/or a causal link between that defect and the occurrence of the damage. In such circumstances, the producer could then find itself, even before the courts ruling on the merits of the case had the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the producer’s evidence and arguments, in the position of having to rebut that presumption in order to defend itself successfully against the claim (see, by analogy, judgments of 9 November 1983, San Giorgio,

          In the present case, evidence such as that relied on in the main proceedings relating to the temporal proximity between the administering of a vaccine and the occurrence of a disease and the lack of personal and familial history of that disease, together with the existence of a significant number of reported cases of the disease occurring following such vaccines being administered, appears on the face of it to constitute evidence which, taken together where applicable, may lead a national court to consider that a victim has discharged his burden of proof under Article 4 of Directive 85/374. That could be the case inter alia where that evidence leads the court to consider, first, that the administering of the vaccine is the most plausible explanation for the occurrence of the disease and, second, that the vaccine therefore does not offer the safety that one is entitled to expect, taking all circumstances into account, as provided for in Article 6 of that directive, because it causes abnormal and particularly serious damage to the patient who, in the light of the nature and function of the product, is entitled to expect a particularly high level of safety (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 March 2015, Boston Scientific Medizintechnik,

          It should be borne in mind in that regard that the safeguarding of rights enjoyed by individuals by virtue of the relevant Treaty provisions depends, to a large extent, on successive legal categorisations of facts. Similarly, it should be noted that when a court, like the referring court in the present case, is called upon to rule at final instance, it is responsible inter alia for ensuring, on a nationwide scale, uniform interpretation of the legal rules (see, to that effect, judgment of 13 June 2006, Traghetti del Mediterraneo,

          The fact remains, however, that the Court does not have jurisdiction to interpret national law and that only the national courts may determine the exact scope of national legislative, statutory or administrative provisions. This holds true inter alia for national provisions on proof (see, to that effect, judgment of 9 February 1999, Dilexport,

          As regards national provisions on proof, covered by the first question, it must nevertheless be emphasised that the national courts called on to apply them must take account of both the principles referred to in paragraphs 37 and 38 of this judgment and of the principle of legal certainty, the corollary of which is the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations, which requires, in particular, that the application of rules of law must be foreseeable by those subject to them (judgment of 2 December 2009, Aventis Pasteur,

        <p class="normal">In stating in its question that once certain pre-determined facts are established, the existence of such a causal link will ‘always be considered to be established’, the referring court seems to refer to an irrefutable presumption. However, such a presumption would have the consequence that, even where the pre-identified facts are not, hypothetically, capable of establishing with certainty the existence of such a causal link, the producer would, in such a case, be deprived of all opportunity to adduce facts or put forward arguments, such as scientific arguments, in order to rebut that presumption, and the court would thus not have any opportunity to assess the facts in the light of that evidence or those arguments. In being so automatic, such a situation would not only undermine the principle set out in Article 4 of Directive 85/374 by which the victim has the burden of proof of the defect and the causal link, but would also risk compromising the very effectiveness of the system of liability introduced by that directive. The presence of one of the three conditions for engaging the liability of the producer under that directive would then be imposed on the court, without its even having the possibility of examining whether the other facts submitted to it for assessment in the case before it might not lead to the opposite conclusion.</p>

As observed in paragraph 36 above, such a situation would lead to the burden of proof provided for in Article 4 of Directive 85/374 being disregarded.</p>
