          However, the European Parliament having, in its legislative resolution of 14 January 2003 on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation on the harmonisation of certain social legislation relating to road transport (

          ), removed the reference to the weekly rest periods from the text of that provision on the ground that, without that amendment, the new scheme would, inter alia, be inadequate regarding drivers’ hygiene and well-being, the Commission presented a compromise by proposing that only a reduced weekly rest period away from base may be taken in the vehicle (see Article 8(6) and paragraph 26 of the explanatory memorandum, COM(2003) 0490 final).

Article 19 of that regulation does not specify a penalty either, but, on the other hand, requires Member States to provide for penalties for infringement of that regulation and to take all necessary steps to ensure that those penalties are applied.</p>

          In that regard, it is apparent from settled case-law that where an EU regulation does not specifically provide for any penalty for its infringement or refers, in that regard, to national laws, regulations and administrative provisions, Article 4(3) TFEU requires the Member States to take all measures necessary to guarantee the application and effectiveness of EU law. For that purpose, while the choice of penalties remains within their discretion, they must ensure in particular that infringements of EU law are penalised under conditions, both procedural and substantive, which are analogous to those applicable to infringements of national law of a similar nature and importance and which, in any event, make the penalty effective, proportionate and dissuasive (see, inter alia, judgments of 10 July 1990, Hansen,

          It should be noted, in that context, that the Court has frequently interpreted secondary legislation which requires Member States to lay down penalties to ensure effective implementation of that legislation in the light of the principle that offences and penalties must have a proper basis in law. Thus, according to that case-law, a directive cannot, of itself and independently of a national law adopted by a Member State for its implementation, have the effect of determining or aggravating the liability in criminal law of persons who act in contravention of the provisions of that directive (see, inter alia, judgment of 7 January 2004, X,

          It is also clear from that case-law that the Court’s reasoning in respect of directives may be transposed to regulations, that is rules which, by their very nature, do not require any national implementing measures, where those regulations empower Member States to adopt penalties for infringements in respect of the behaviour prohibited by those regulations (see, to that effect, judgment of 7 January 2004, X,
