          at the request of DHL Paket. That advertisement presented five different products, which it was possible to purchase through that undertaking’s sales platform. A reader who was interested by one of those products was invited to visit that platform and enter the code corresponding to the product on it, that code being referred to in the advertisement. He was then transferred to the site of the product concerned where the identity of the commercial seller of that product was mentioned. Under the heading ‘Supplier information’, the reader could also find details of the trading name and geographical address of his contracting partner. Finally, it was stated in that advertisement that the platform in question enabled interested persons to have access to over 5 million products and more than 2500 traders.

        <p class="normal">According to the referring court, it appears to be immaterial in this connection whether the customer is able to purchase the advertised products exclusively via the advertiser’s website. Admittedly, the information provided at that stage still reaches the consumer prior to the moment when the transaction takes place or is accessible before that moment. However, that happens too late to enable him to make an informed decision as to whether he should look into the advertised products in more detail, and, to that end, visit that website. In addition, the fact that a consumer on a computer can order products in peace and unobserved by sales staff does not alter the fact that he does not have the material information regarding the geographical address and identity of the seller of the advertised products before he visits the advertiser’s website.</p>

          Secondly, it must be recalled that, under Article 7(4)(b) of Directive 2005/29, the geographical address and the identity of the trader, such as his trading name and, where applicable, the geographical address and the identity of the trader on whose behalf he is acting constitute material information. However, that provision must be read in conjunction with Article 7(1) of that directive, according to which the commercial practice at issue must be assessed having regard, inter alia, to its factual context and the limitations of the medium of communication used (judgment of 12 May 2011, Ving Sverige,
