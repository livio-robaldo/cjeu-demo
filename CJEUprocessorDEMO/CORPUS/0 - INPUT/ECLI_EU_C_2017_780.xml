Thus there is no need, in order for Directive 2001/23 to be applicable, for there to be any direct contractual relationship between the transferor and the transferee: the transfer may take place through the intermediary of a third party (see, inter alia, judgments of 7 March 1996, Merckx and Neuhuys,

          In order to determine whether that condition is met, it is necessary to consider all the facts characterising the transaction in question, including in particular the type of undertaking or business, whether or not its tangible assets, such as buildings and movable property, are transferred, the value of its intangible assets at the time of the transfer, whether or not the majority of its employees are taken over by the new employer, whether or not its customers are transferred, the degree of similarity between the activities carried on before and after the transfer, and the period, if any, for which those activities were suspended.

          It follows that the degree of importance to be attached to each criterion for determining whether or not there has been a transfer within the meaning of Directive 2001/23 will necessarily vary according to the activity carried on, or indeed the production or operating methods employed in the relevant undertaking, business or part of a business (judgment of 26 November 2015, Aira Pascual and Algeposa Terminales Ferroviarios,

          The Court has therefore held that, in a sector where the activity is based essentially on manpower, the identity of an economic entity cannot be retained if the majority of its employees are not taken on by the alleged transferee (judgment of 26 November 2015, Aira Pascual and Algeposa Terminales Ferroviarios,

          Where, however, the activity is based essentially on equipment, the fact that the former employees of an undertaking are not taken over by the new contractor to perform that activity, as in the case in the main proceedings, is not sufficient to preclude the existence of a transfer of an economic entity which retains its identity, within the meaning of Directive 2001/23.

          In that regard, the Court has already held that the mere loss of a service contract to a competitor cannot by itself indicate the existence of a transfer within the meaning of Directive 2001/23 (judgment of 11 March 1997, Süzen,

However, a provision of national law that generally excludes the loss of a customer by an operator following the award of a service contract to another operator from the scope of that concept does not allow all the facts characterising the transaction in question to be taken into consideration.
