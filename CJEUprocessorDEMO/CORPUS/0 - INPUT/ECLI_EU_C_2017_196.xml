Given that, under that provision, mutual recognition applies only to the certificate attesting the veracity of the signature of a private instrument that has been appended to that instrument by ‘a court, an administrative body or an Austrian notary’, extending the scope of its application to certificates appended by Czech lawyers would, it held, be contrary not only to Article 21(2) but to the intention of the contracting parties themselves.</p>

Whilst the former case is explicitly mentioned in the third paragraph of Article 57 TFEU, which permits the person providing the service to pursue his activity temporarily in the Member State where the service is provided under the same conditions as are imposed by that State on its own nationals, the latter case, which fulfils the objective of making all gainful activity not covered by the free movement of goods, persons and capital subject to the freedom to provide services, is the necessary corollary thereof (see, inter alia, judgment of 24 September 2013, Demirkan,

        <p class="normal">First, however, as the Austrian and German Governments, among others, have noted, it should be stated that the land register is of crucial importance especially in certain Member States which operate a system of civil-law notaries, particularly in property transactions. In particular, each entry in a land register — such as the Austrian land register — alters rights, in so far as the rights of the person who has requested that entry arise only after the corresponding entry has been made therein. Maintaining the land register thus constitutes an essential component of the preventive administration of justice in the sense that it seeks to ensure proper application of the law and legal certainty of documents concluded between individuals, which are matters coming within the scope of the tasks and responsibilities of the State.</p>

          In those conditions, national provisions which require verification, by recourse to sworn professionals — such as notaries — of the accuracy of entries made in a land register contribute to guaranteeing the legal certainty of property transactions and the proper functioning of the land register and relate, more generally, to the safeguarding of the sound administration of justice, which, in accordance with the case-law of the Court, constitutes an overriding reason in the public interest (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 December 1996, Reisebüro Broede,

          ), in relation to the freedom of establishment, that the fact that notarial activities pursue objectives in the public interest, in particular that of guaranteeing the legality and legal certainty of documents concluded between individuals, constitutes an overriding reason in the public interest capable of justifying restrictions of Article 49 TFEU resulting from the particular features of the activities of public notaries, such as the restrictions which derive from the procedures by which they are appointed, the limitation of their numbers and their territorial jurisdiction, or the rules governing their remuneration, independence, disqualification from other offices and protection against removal, provided that those restrictions make it possible for those objectives to be attained and are necessary for that purpose.
