In such a case and as long as such undertakings are in force, provisional duties imposed by the Commission in accordance with Article 7(1) or definitive duties imposed by the Council in accordance with Article 9(4) as the case may be shall not apply to the relevant imports of the product concerned manufactured by the companies referred to in the Commission decision accepting undertakings, as subsequently amended. Price increases under such undertakings shall not be higher than necessary to eliminate the margin of dumping and they should be less than the margin of dumping if such increases would be adequate to remove the injury to the Community industry.</p>

Whereas it is correct that an important increase in prices may lead to an important reduction of demand … it is very unlikely that price increases caused by the measures will be important, for the following reasons. … the economic effect of the undertaking that has been accepted by the Commission is that Chinese exporting producers will supply the product concerned at a minimum import price of less than 60 c/W, which is far below the price that has been observed during the IP, at a volume that corresponds roughly to their current market share. At this price level, demand is very unlikely to drop in a significant manner, as that price level ensures sufficient demand both under the current level of support provided by support schemes and under the current levels of grid parity. Furthermore, the price of electricity for final consumers is expected to increase, whereas the price of the product concerned is expected to decrease. Through an indexation formula, the undertaking ensures that further price decreases of the product concerned are taken into account for the minimum import price. … ’</p>

With regards, more specifically, to the MIP, Article 8 of the basic regulation allows the Council and the Commission to accept MIP undertakings from individual exporting producers if the prices offered eliminate the injurious effects of dumping. Those producers are then exempt from paying the ad valorem duty because they are subject to another form of measures, namely the MIP in the context of their undertaking. Accordingly, the objective of anti-dumping measures, regardless of their form, is characterised by their adequacy to remove the injury to EU producers of the same product, and, in that regard, should have a remedial effect.</p>

In the present case, Article 3(2)(b) of the regulation at issue refers specifically to Article 8(9) of the basic regulation and, since the adoption of the regulation at issue, the Commission has withdrawn the acceptance of the MIP undertaking in respect of several Chinese exporting producers, imposing ad valorem duties on them. Thus, there has never been a time, since the entry into force of the regulation at issue, when those exporting producers were not subject to anti-dumping measures.</p>

In that regard, SolarWorld indicates that such a declaration of invalidity would not necessarily have brought about a change of the scope of the measures, which is at the very core of the General Court’s reasoning in paragraph 55 of the order under appeal. The only legal consequence of such a declaration would have been that the Council and the Commission would either have had to accept new undertakings containing a new MIP, eliminating the injurious effects of the dumping, or decide to apply ad valorem duties to all the Chinese exporting producers.</p>

In addition, according to SolarWorld, the large number of Chinese exporting producers subject to the MIP does not alter the fact that the regulation at issue imposes anti-dumping measures and that the form of those measures is an issue which relates to neither the scope nor the subject matter of those measures.</p>

          It is clear from the settled case-law of the Court of Justice that the partial annulment of an EU act is possible only if the elements whose annulment is sought may be severed from the remainder of the act. In that regard, the Court of Justice has repeatedly held that the requirement of severability is not satisfied in the case where the partial annulment of an act would have the effect of altering its substance (judgment of 12 November 2015, United Kingdom v Parliament and Council,

Two findings result from an examination of that recital. First, such an undertaking will have a positive economic effect on the European market for those products, to the extent that the MIP, by providing a lower price than that observed during the investigation period, would allow for the maintenance of a sufficient demand for the products at issue in the European Union. That measure thus appears to have had a significant and separate effect from that of the imposition of an ad valorem duty.</p>

        <p class="normal">Second, it should be recalled that the trade defence measures laid down by the regulation at issue contain objective differences as regards their nature. As was correctly pointed out by the Commission in its statement of intervention, when an ad valorem duty is imposed within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the regulation at issue, Chinese exporting producers are free to set their selling price to the European Union, a duty being subsequently imposed on that price once the product at issue is imported into the European Union. The revenue accruing from that duty is paid into the EU budget. By contrast, when a MIP is applied, those exporting producers may no longer freely set their price, that price having to be increased to the level of the MIP for imports of the product at issue declared for the free circulation. The additional revenue from that price increase accrues to the exporting producers in question.</p>

        <p class="normal">Accordingly, the regulation at issue is based on the possibility of applying those two separate measures alternatively, which allows Chinese exporting producers to rely on the MIP undertaking accepted by the Commission, within the meaning of Article 3 of the regulation at issue, and thus to avoid an ad valorem anti-dumping duty, such as that laid down by Article 1 of that regulation, from being imposed on their products. The annulment of Article 3 of that regulation would remove such a possibility and eliminate the alternative which the EU legislature wished to offer to Chinese exporting producers when adopting the regulation at issue. Taking account of the differences in the economic consequences of those two types of trade defence measures, such an annulment would therefore affect the very substance of the regulation at issue.</p>

That undertaking therefore appears to be intended to apply primarily in the context of the imports from China concerned by the regulation at issue.
