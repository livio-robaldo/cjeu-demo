          As regards, first of all, the question, raised by the European Commission, of whether Mr Bordonaro may be classified as a ‘worker’ within the meaning of Article 45 TFEU, it must be recalled that according to consistent case-law of the Court, that concept has a specific independent meaning and must not be interpreted narrowly. So, any person who pursues real, genuine activities, to the exclusion of activities on such a small scale as to be regarded as purely marginal and ancillary, must be regarded as a ‘worker’. The essential feature of an employment relationship is, according to that case-law, that for a certain period of time a person performs services for and under the direction of another person in return for which he receives remuneration (judgments of 3 July 1986, Lawrie-Blum,

          The overall assessment of Mr Bordonaro’s employment relationship makes it necessary to take into account factors relating not only to the number of working hours and the level of remuneration but also to the right to paid leave, to the continued payment of wages in the event of sickness, to a contract of employment which is subject to the relevant collective agreement, to the payment of contributions and, as appropriate, the type of those contributions (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 February 2010, Genc,

As is clear from the file before the Court, he worked at night four to five times per week for the first months of his employment then, as from 2011, between three and four times per week. Furthermore, at the hearing before the Court, Mr Bordonaro stated that he was in the same situation as 400 other Abercrombie employees, whose contract was governed by collective agreements.</p>

While, in the case of workers aged 25 years or more and up to 45 years, an on-call employment contract may be concluded only with a view to the performance of services of a discontinuous or intermittent nature in accordance with the requirements specified in the collective agreements and for predetermined periods, the conclusion of such an on-call employment contract in the case of workers aged under 25 years or over 45 years is not subject to any of those conditions and may be used ‘in all circumstances’, with the stipulation, as the Italian Government stated at the hearing, that contracts concluded with workers aged under 25 years automatically come to an end when those workers reach the age of 25 years.</p>

That government pointed out that, on a labour market in difficulty such as the Italian market, the lack of professional experience is a factor which hampers young people.
