Since that criterion is, however, used to establish correctly the necessary distinction between categories C1/C and D1/D, that omission would result, in the Member State concerned, in the holder of a category C1 or C driving licence being authorised to drive a vehicle constructed for the carriage of up to eight passengers, irrespective of the fact that the vehicle was designed for the carriage of passengers or goods, whereas Directive 2006/126 requires a category D1 or D driving licence if the vehicle is designed and constructed for the carriage of passengers.</p>

        <p class="normal">Secondly, the Czech Republic argues that it drew up a definition, at national level, of vehicle categories C1, C, and D1, which is precise, understandable and, in practice, unlikely to give rise to dispute. Assuming that no car should fall within several categories, that Member State takes the view that this objective may be achieved in two ways, namely, either by establishing the definition of a category negatively compared to other categories, the solution adopted in Directive 2006/126, or by defining individual categories so that they do not overlap, which is the solution that the Czech legislature adopted by setting a lower limit for the number of passengers that category D1 vehicles may carry.</p>

As noted in paragraphs 29 to 32 of the present judgment, the existence of that additional condition leads to differences in how that directive is applied in the Czech Republic compared to other Member States when determining the category within which a vehicle falls, and, accordingly, the type of driving licence required for that vehicle.</p>

        <p class="normal">Thirdly, the Czech Republic argues that vehicles falling within category D1 are a subset of category D, as is apparent from the name given to category D1 and the legislative history of the definitions of the categories at EU level. It is an ‘abridged’ version of category D, and the category D1 vehicles thus cover a specific section of category D vehicles which, in the light of their characteristics, require only an abridged version of the category D driving licence. Since the lower limit relating to the number of persons who may be carried appears in the definition of category D, it should be reproduced in Category D1.</p>

The fact that, for example, category D1 includes vehicles not falling under category D, like the implications entailed by the categorisation of the different driving licences, is therefore a choice that the EU legislature made and whose usefulness may not be called into question in the context of the present action for failure to fulfil obligations.</p>
