That is the case only with regard to irregularities which have ended more than four years before ‘the programme is definitively terminated’— irregularities which, in the absence of an interruption of the limitation period on one of the grounds set out in the third subparagraph of Article 3(1) of Regulation No 2988/95, will be immediately time-barred once that termination has taken place.</p>
