          Secondly, as has already been pointed out in paragraph 39 of the present judgment, it should be recalled that the two-year period of liability of the seller from the time of delivery of the goods, as mentioned in the first sentence of Article 5(1) of Directive 1999/44, is a mandatory time limit from which the parties to the contract, as a rule, cannot derogate. Therefore, as noted by the Advocate General in points 74 and 75 of his Opinion, the second subparagraph of Article 7(1) of the directive, which allows Member States to provide that, in the case of second-hand goods, the parties may stipulate a shorter time period for the liability of the seller, of not less than one year, is an exception, which must be interpreted strictly (see, by analogy, judgment of 1 March 2012, González Alonso,

        <p class="normal">A national rule such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which would allow the limitation period afforded to consumers to be shortened as a consequence of the reduction of the period of liability of the seller to one year, would result in a lesser level of consumer protection and would undermine the guarantees afforded to consumers under Directive 1999/44. Indeed, as noted by the Advocate General in point 93 of his Opinion, the consumer would be entirely deprived of legal remedies before the end of a period of two years from the time of delivery of the goods, a period of time which he is guaranteed, however, under the second sentence of Article 5(1) of the directive.</p>
