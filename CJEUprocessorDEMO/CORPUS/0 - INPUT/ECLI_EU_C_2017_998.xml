The second plea alleged ‘infringement of the tender specifications’, in so far as EUIPO applied, to their detriment, a new award criterion and a new weighting of award sub-criteria not included in the tender specifications. In the third plea, European Dynamics Luxembourg and Others claimed that EUIPO had made a number of manifest errors of assessment.</p>

        <p class="normal">First of all, in connection with the second plea, the General Court held, in paragraph 48 of the judgment under appeal, that EUIPO’s negative comment on the bid submitted by European Dynamics Luxembourg that the bids obtaining a higher score than it obtained under the first award criterion ‘identified change management and communication as the two most essential tasks for the success of the project’ showed that EUIPO had applied a weighting to the various sub-criteria within the first award criterion. In paragraph 53 of that judgment, the General Court found that, since such weighting was not provided for by the tender specifications or communicated in advance to the tenderers, EUIPO had breached, to the detriment of European Dynamics Luxembourg and Others, the principles of equal opportunity and transparency. Accordingly, in paragraph 55 of that judgment, the General Court upheld the second plea in part.</p>

        <p class="normal">Next, in its examination of the third plea, the General Court considered that certain negative comments made by EUIPO concerning the assessment of the bid submitted by European Dynamics Luxembourg in respect of the first and second award criteria stemmed from a manifest error of assessment. First, it found, in paragraph 91 of the judgment under appeal, that, as the negative comment referred to in that paragraph was vitiated by a breach of the principles of equal opportunity and transparency, that conclusion itself also necessarily entailed a manifest error of assessment. Second, the General Court stated, in paragraph 102 of that judgment, that that negative comment, to the effect that European Dynamics Luxembourg had not provided any ‘examples of deliverables’, also stemmed from a manifest error of assessment as there was no support for it in the tender specifications. As a consequence, it upheld the third plea as regards the complaints directed against those negative comments and dismissed the plea as to the remainder.</p>

          EUIPO submits that the General Court erred in law by considering that the alleged introduction of new weighting factors in respect of the first award criterion led to a breach of the principles of equal opportunity and transparency. It argues that the General Court was incorrect to find that the decision at issue infringed those principles in that the evaluation of the bid submitted by European Dynamics Luxembourg was carried out, under the first award criterion, using factors for weighting sub-criteria within that award criterion which were not apparent from the tender specifications and were not disclosed to the tenderers. According to EUIPO, the assessment in paragraph 53 of the judgment under appeal, which establishes an ‘automatic causal link’ between the introduction of those weighting factors and the breach of those principles, is based on a misinterpretation of the Court’s case-law and, moreover, is not supported by sufficient reasoning. In particular, EUIPO refers in that regard to the judgment of 24 November 2005, ATI EAC and Viaggi di Maio and Others (

          Nevertheless, it is possible for a contracting authority to determine, after expiry of the time-limit for submitting tenders, weighting factors for sub-criteria which correspond in essence to the criteria previously brought to the tenderers’ attention. That subsequent determination must, however, satisfy three conditions, namely, it must not: (i) alter the criteria for the award of the contract set out in the contract documents or contract notice; (ii) contain elements which, if they had been known at the time the tenders were prepared, could have affected that preparation; and (iii) have been adopted on the basis of matters likely to give rise to discrimination against one of the tenderers (see, to that effect, judgments of 24 November 2005, ATI EAC and Viaggi di Maio and Others,

          As the conclusion in paragraph 53 of the judgment under appeal is vitiated by an error of law, it follows that it must be found, as the Advocate General observed in point 49 of his Opinion, that the judgment under appeal is also vitiated by another error in law, in that, by upholding the ninth complaint in the first part of the third plea in law at first instance, the General Court concluded there had been a manifest error of assessment in relation to the first award criterion in question. If it is not possible to rely on that conclusion, paragraphs 91 and 96 of that judgment are deprived of all reason.

It submits that it is apparent from the General Court’s own case-law that it is for the applicant to demonstrate that a manifest error of assessment has had an effect on the final outcome of the tender procedure, which is a matter the General Court should therefore have considered.

However, the contracting authority cannot be required to communicate to an unsuccessful tenderer, first, in addition to the reasons for rejecting its tender, a detailed summary of how each detail of its tender was taken into account when the tender was evaluated and, secondly, in the notification of the characteristics and relative advantages of the successful tender, a detailed comparative analysis of the successful tender and of the unsuccessful tender.

Nonetheless, even though the General Court’s findings in paragraphs 53, 91 and 96 of the judgment under appeal cannot serve as justification for the annulment of the decision at issue, the irregularities found by the General Court in paragraphs 86, 89, 95, 102 and 135 of the judgment provide sufficient justification, as the Advocate General observed in point 111 of his Opinion, for the General Court’s annulment of that decision.
