          Furthermore, it is common ground, according to the referring court, that the subject matter of the dispute at issue in the main proceedings concerns a commercial concession agreement for which compensation is sought for loss arising from the premature and sudden termination together with a good will indemnity for failing to observe the related requirement of semi-exclusivity. Therefore, it is important to verify, which is also a matter for the referring court, whether the jurisdiction clause at issue in the main proceedings concerns that legal relationship. In principle, a jurisdiction clause may produce effects only in the relations between the parties who have given their agreement to the conclusion of that contract (judgment of 7 February 2013, Refcomp,

          First of all, it should be pointed out that the connecting factors for determining the court with jurisdiction that are laid down in Article 7(1)(b) of Regulation No 1215/2012 are applicable only in so far as the national court hearing the dispute which has arisen between the parties that entered into a long-standing business relationship with each other comes to the conclusion that that relationship is founded on a ‘contract for the sale of goods’ or a ‘contract for the provision of services’, for the purposes of that provision. Such a classification would exclude the application of the rule of jurisdiction laid down in Article 7(1)(a) thereof. In view of the hierarchy which Article 5(1)(c) establishes between Article 5(1)(a) and (b), the rule of jurisdiction laid down in Article 5(1)(a) is intended to apply only in the alternative and if the rules of jurisdiction in Article 5(1)(b) do not apply (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 July 2016, Granarolo,

          As to whether a contract may be classified as a ‘contract for the supply of services’, within the meaning of Article 7(1)(b), second indent, of Regulation No 1215/2012, it must be recalled that the concept of ‘services’ implies, at the least, that the party who provides the service carries out a particular activity in return for remuneration (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 June 2017, Kareda,

          As regards the criterion relating to the existence of an activity, it is clear from the case-law of the Court that it requires the performance of positive acts, rather than mere omissions. That criterion corresponds, in the case of a concession agreement, to the characteristic service provided by the concessionaire which, by distributing the products of the grantor of the concession, is involved in increasing their distribution. As a result of the supply guarantee it enjoys under the concession agreement and, as the case may be, its involvement in the grantor’s commercial planning, in particular with respect to marketing operations, factors in respect of which the national court has jurisdiction to make a ruling, the concessionaire is able to offer clients services and benefits that a mere reseller cannot and thereby acquire, for the benefit of the grantor’s products, a larger share of the local market (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 December 2013, Corman-Collins,

          As to the criterion of the remuneration provided as consideration for an activity, it must be pointed out that it cannot be understood in the strict sense of the payment of a sum of money. Account must be taken, first, of the competitive advantage conferred on the concessionaire by the benefit, by virtue of the contract concluded between the parties, of an exclusive or semi-exclusive right to sell the grantor’s products in a particular territory and, second, assistance provided to the concessionaire regarding access to advertising, communicating know-how by means of training or yet even payment facilities, all of which represent an economic value for the concessionaire that may be regarded as constituting remuneration (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 December 2013, Corman-Collins,
