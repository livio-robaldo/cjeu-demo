Consequently, when the Court has to interpret a harmonised standard, it can take account, as one factor among others, of the existence of a European assessment document or a European technical assessment as an indication that the products covered by it, and similar products, are not covered by any harmonised standard, but without such a factor being determinative or preventing the Court, if appropriate, from arriving at an interpretation of the harmonised standard in question that differs from that adopted by the author of the document or assessment.</p>
