          As regards, in particular, a procedure conducted by a notary for the enforcement of a mortgage, it should be noted that adequate and effective means to stop the use of unfair terms in consumer contracts must include provisions enabling consumers to be guaranteed effective judicial protection by making it possible for them to contest the contract at issue in legal proceedings, including in the enforcement phase, and under reasonable procedural conditions, so that the exercise of their rights is not subject to conditions, in particular time limits or costs, which make it excessively difficult or in practice impossible to exercise the rights guaranteed by Directive 93/13 (judgment of 1 October 2015, ERSTE Bank Hungary,
