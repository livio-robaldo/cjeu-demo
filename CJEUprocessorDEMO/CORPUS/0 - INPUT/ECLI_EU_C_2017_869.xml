          The Court of Justice has consistently held that the need for a uniform application of EU law and the principle of equality require that the terms of a provision of EU law which makes no express reference to the law of the Member States for the purpose of determining its meaning and scope must normally be given an autonomous and uniform interpretation, which must take into account the context of that provision and the purpose of the legislation in question (see, to that effect, judgment of 13 October 2016, Mikołajczyk,

          It should also be observed at the outset that, according to settled case-law of the Court, the terms used to describe the exemptions envisaged by Article 135(1) of the VAT Directive are to be interpreted strictly since these constitute exceptions to the general principle that VAT is to be levied on all services supplied for consideration by a taxable person (see judgment of 19 November 2009, Don Bosco Onroerend Goed,

          Nevertheless, the interpretation of those terms must be consistent with the objectives pursued by those exemptions and comply with the requirements of the principle of fiscal neutrality inherent in the common system of VAT. Accordingly, that requirement of strict interpretation does not mean that the terms used to specify the exemptions referred to in that article must be construed in such a way as to deprive the exemptions of their intended effects (judgment of 19 November 2009, Don Bosco Onroerend Goed,

          As is clear from, first of all, the preparatory documents for the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes — Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment (

          ), which remain relevant for the interpretation of the VAT Directive in the context of the exemptions laid down in Article 135(1)(j) thereof, the criterion of the ‘first occupation’ of a building must be understood as corresponding to the first use of the property by its owner or tenant. The preparatory documents state that that criterion was included as determining the point in time when the product was likely to leave the production process and enter into the consumption sector. It does not follow from that historical analysis that the use of the building by its owner must take place in the context of a taxable transaction.

          Finally, the VAT exemptions are intended to enable a comparable collection of the European Union’s own resources in all the Member States. It follows that, even if Article 135(1)(j) of the VAT Directive, read in conjunction with Article 12 thereof (to which it refers), refers to the conditions for exemption fixed by the Member States, the exemptions laid down by that provision correspond to autonomous concepts of EU law so that the basis for assessing VAT may be determined in a uniform manner and according to common rules (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 October 2001, Goed Wonen,

Even though such a percentage suggests a priori that the modifications made could have, as a result of their quantity, contributed to altering considerably the conditions of occupation of the building, it is for the national court, however, to assess on the basis of the evidence available to it, the extent to which the ‘upgrade’ at issue in the main proceedings led to a substantial modification of that building, in the sense set out in paragraph 52 of this judgment.</p>

        <p class="normal">In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the question referred is that Article 12(1) and (2) and Article 135(1)(j) of the VAT Directive must be interpreted as precluding a national law, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which makes the VAT exemption on the supply of buildings subject to the condition that the first occupation thereof arises in the context of a taxable transaction. The same provisions must be interpreted as not precluding such a national law from making that exemption subject to the condition, in the case of the ‘upgrade’ of an existing building, that the costs incurred have not exceeded 30% of the initial value thereof, provided that that concept of‘upgrade’ is interpreted in the same way as that of ‘conversion’ in Article 12(2) of the VAT Directive, namely as meaning that the building concerned must have been subject to substantial modifications intended to modify the use or alter considerably the conditions of occupation.</p>
