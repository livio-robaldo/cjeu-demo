Such a bid shall be addressed at the earliest opportunity to all the holders of those securities for all their holdings at the equitable price as defined in paragraph 4.</p>

If, after the bid has been made public and before the offer closes for acceptance, the offeror or any person acting in concert with him/her purchases securities at a price higher than the offer price, the offeror shall increase his/her offer so that it is not less than the highest price paid for the securities so acquired.</p>

To that end, they may draw up a list of circumstances in which the highest price may be adjusted either upwards or downwards, for example where the highest price was set by agreement between the purchaser and a seller, where the market prices of the securities in question have been manipulated, where market prices in general or certain market prices in particular have been affected by exceptional occurrences, or in order to enable a firm in difficulty to be rescued. They may also determine the criteria to be applied in such cases, for example the average market value over a particular period, the break-up value of the company or other objective valuation criteria generally used in financial analysis.</p>

In its global analysis of the interests of the various operators involved, it held that the agreement with MCI was an objective pursued by all the signatories to the Pirelli agreement who brought about the transaction to acquire Camfin, but also for all the other signatories to the agreement, who were persons objectively interested in the conclusion of a global agreement between MTP and MCI.</p>

          The referring court recalls, first of all, the objectives of the provisions on the determination of the mandatory takeover bid price and sets out the principal findings in the first instance judgments. Next, it sets out the essential arguments made by the appellants in the main proceedings, that the lack of obligation of finding that there was an element of intention on the part of all those participating in the collusion conferred on the supervisory authority an unlimited degree of discretion in assessing the conduct of the offeror, the seller and third party operators on the market. According to them, that degree of discretion is incompatible with the requirement that there is certainty in the
          <span class="italic">ex ante</span>
          identification of the conduct relevant for the purposes of increasing the price of the takeover bid.

If that notion were applied, such as it is, to the field of law at issue in the main proceedings, the grounds of appeal would have to be upheld, since the companies which transferred their holdings in Pirelli to MCI were not parties to any clandestine or fraudulent agreement.</p>

        <p class="normal">However, the referring court observes that, within the specific field of law at issue in the main proceedings, Consob’s power to make adjustments is regulatory in nature rather than penal, which precludes the simple transposition, into that field of law, of the definition of the notion of ‘collusion’ such as it exists in other fields of Italian law. It emphasises moreover that, in competition law and regulation of the markets, the notion of a ‘prohibited agreement’ may also be deduced from apparently independent actions by operators in cases where those actions objectively produce an effect prohibited by the law. It follows from the foregoing that, as the Tribunale amministrativo regionale per il Lazio (Lazio Regional Administrative Court) held, for the purposes of establishing collusion, it is not necessary that the authority proves that the action of the parties was intended to circumvent the law relating to takeover bids.</p>

It notes that the operators on the market of a listed company could not carry out a prior evaluation of the actions to take before a takeover bid, which would have the consequence that neutral and lawful actions on the basis of an ex ante evaluation could be regarded, ex post, on the basis of a reclassification that turned exclusively on the objective effects of a more complex situation, unknown to the operators and persons involved, of collusive conduct justifying the increase of a takeover bid price.</p>
