          In the present case, the dispute in the main proceedings concerns a measure penalising a relevant person for failing to comply with a decision directing it to provide the requested authority with information to enable that authority to respond to a request made by the requesting authority on the basis, in particular, of Directive 2011/16. Since that penalty was based on a national provision which, as is evident from the answer to the first question, implements EU law within the meaning of Article 51(1) of the Charter, it follows that the provisions of the Charter, in particular Article 47 thereof, are applicable to the facts of the dispute in the main proceedings (see, to that effect, judgment of 26 September 2013, Texdata Software,

          ). The latter case concerned requests for information sent by the tax administration of one Member State to the tax administration of another Member State and, in particular, the right for the taxpayer who was the subject of a tax investigation in the requesting Member State to participate in the procedure relating to those requests. No request for information had, however, been sent to the relevant person, unlike in the case of Berlioz in the main proceedings. Thus, in the case that led to that judgment, the Court was called upon to determine whether the taxpayer who was the subject of requests for information as between national tax administrations had a right to be heard in that process, and not, as in the present case, whether a relevant person in the requested Member State has a right to a remedy against a penalty imposed on him for failure to comply with an information order issued to him by the requested authority following a request for information sent to that authority by the requesting authority.

          In the context of judicial proceedings, it should be borne in mind that the principle of equality of arms, which is a corollary of the very concept of a fair hearing, implies that each party must be afforded a reasonable opportunity to present his case, including his evidence, under conditions that do not place him at a substantial disadvantage vis-à-vis his opponent (judgment of 6 November 2012, Otis and Others,
