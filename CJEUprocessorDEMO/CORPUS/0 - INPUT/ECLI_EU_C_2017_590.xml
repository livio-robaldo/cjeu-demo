On that basis, the Minister for Immigration and Integration took the view that Mr Ouhrami represented a threat to public policy and, accordingly, declared him undesirable. As a result, Mr Ouhrami was under the obligation (i) to leave the Netherlands, failing which he could be removed, and (ii) to remain outside the Netherlands for 10 consecutive years since he had been declared undesirable, inter alia as a result of drug-related crimes.

Following the expiry of that deadline, such a declaration of undesirability must in principle comply with the maximum duration of five years laid down in Article 11(2) of that directive.

          In that regard, it must be noted that it is settled case-law that Directive 2008/115 precludes legislation of a Member State laying down criminal penalties for initial illegal stays, in so far as that legislation permits the imprisonment of a third-country national who, though staying illegally on the territory of that Member State and not being willing to leave that territory voluntarily, has not been subject to the coercive measures referred to in Article 8 of the directive. However, the Court has pointed out that Directive 2008/115 does not preclude national legislation which permits the imprisonment of a third-country national to whom the return procedure established by the directive has been applied and who is staying illegally on the territory of the Member State without a justified ground for non-return (see, to that effect, judgments of 6 December 2011, Achughbabian,
