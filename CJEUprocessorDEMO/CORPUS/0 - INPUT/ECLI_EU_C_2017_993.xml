          According to Article 64(1) of the Lugano II Convention, the latter does not prejudice the application by the Member States of Regulation No 44/2001, as well as any amendments thereof.

          Finally, as far as concerns the conditions laid down in Article 27(1) of the Lugano II Convention, relating to the identity of the parties and the cause of action brought before the courts of different States, it must be observed that, as is clear from the case-law of the Court relating to the interpretation of Article 27 of Regulation No 44/2001, which is transposable to the interpretation of Article 27 of the Lugano II Convention, that an action seeking to have the defendant held liable for causing loss has the same cause of action as an action brought by that defendant seeking a declaration that he is not liable for that loss (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 December 2013, NIPPONKOA Insurance,

          It is clear from the CCP that, under Swiss law, a case is brought by lodging an application for conciliation, an action or, joint application for divorce. The conciliation procedure is laid down by law, is subject to the principle of
          <span class="italic">audi alteram partem</span>
          and is, in principle, obligatory. Failure to observe that obligation leads to the inadmissibility of any subsequent legal proceedings. That procedure may give rise either to a binding judgment, for disputes the value of which does not exceed CHF 2000 (approximately EUR 1740), a draft judgment which may become final in the absence of challenge for disputes whose value does not exceed CHF 5000 (approximately EUR 4350), the signing of a conciliation agreement, or the issue of an authorisation to institute proceedings. In the latter case, the plaintiff is entitled to bring an action before the courts within three months of authorisation to proceed being granted. Article 9(2) of the Swiss Federal Code on Private International Law states that, in order to determine when a court in Switzerland is seised, the date of the first act necessary to institute the action is to be decisive and that the initiation of conciliation proceedings is to suffice.
