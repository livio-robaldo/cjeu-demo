Accordingly, the concept of a ‘global marketing authorisation’ within the meaning of that provision should be given a functional interpretation and may encompass, formally, a number of separate MAs. Thus, it is irrelevant whether an additional strength, pharmaceutical form, administration route or presentation of an original medicinal product or a variation or extension gave rise to an amendment of the initial MA or a separate MA under a different name.

          In addition, in paragraphs 54 to 60 of each of the judgments under appeal, the General Court noted that the EU legislation on medicinal products applicable when the MA application was made for Aclasta did not govern the issue whether a development of that medicinal product must be authorised by a variation of the terms of the initial MA or whether it could be authorised by the grant of a separate MA. It was only after the entry into force of Regulation No 726/2004 that a restriction on the grant of several MAs was introduced. Accordingly, when it filed its MA application for Aclasta, Novartis had the choice of either submitting an application for the variation of the terms and extension of the MA for Zometa, or submitting a separate MA for a medicinal product bearing a different name, which it did for commercial reasons, as is clear from the contents of its letter of 26 February 2001 to the EMA, and from the Public Assessment Report on Aclasta. According to the General Court, the market strategy of an undertaking cannot affect the data protection period for a given active substance. It referred, in that respect, to point 57 in the Opinion of Advocate General Jacobs in Novartis Pharmaceuticals (

          ), whenever a subsequently authorised variant of a reference product had been given a new designation would elevate form over substance, and would create an easy route for applicants to gain additional data protection in circumvention of that case-law. According to the General Court, if an independent data protection period automatically started to run as a result of the authorisation of a variation consisting in the improvement of a reference medicinal product by the grant of a separate MA, the holder of the MA of a reference medicinal product would be able to extend the date protection period in relation to that medicinal product indefinitely.

It would also be at odds with the concept of a ‘global marketing authorisation’, within the meaning of the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) of Directive 2001/83, the objective of which is to save the time and expense needed to gather the results of the preclinical and clinical trials, and to avoid the repetition of tests on humans or animals. Moreover, it is ineffective to invoke the necessity of protecting the investments that may be required in order to improve or develop the original medicinal product, since the EU legislature expressly dealt with that question in the fourth subparagraph of Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83 and Article 14(11) of Regulation No 726/2004, by providing for an additional year of protection in the event that an authorisation is granted for a significant innovation during the first 8-year period after the grant of the initial MA. The General Court notes, in passing, that that additional protection would be pointless if, by obtaining a separate MA for new therapeutic indications and a new strength, applicants were able to obtain automatically a new regulatory 10-year data protection period with effect from the date on which that separate MA was granted.</p>

According to Novartis, that provision must be interpreted as meaning that the MA relating to the development of that medicinal product may be regarded as forming part of a ‘global marketing authorisation’ only where it was granted following an application expressly seeking the amendment of the initial MA, and not where that development was the subject of a separate MA, granted in the context of a centralised procedure, for a medicinal product bearing a new name.</p>

Thus, the concept of a ‘global marketing authorisation’, within the meaning of the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) of Directive 2001/83, would encompass any development which could be authorised as a variation or extension of the MA for the original medicinal product, irrespective of whether such a development has in fact given rise to the grant of a new MA as a new medicinal product with a new name.</p>

That provision refers, as authorisations that must be included in the ‘global marketing authorisation’, only to those which were actually granted for a change of strength, pharmaceutical form, route of administration or presentation of a medicinal product covered by an initial MA, as well as any variation or extension, and not, in a much broader manner, to authorisations which could have been included in that global authorisation, on the basis of that provision. Such a broad interpretation of the second subparagraph of Article 6(1) of Directive 2001/83 is also not in accordance with the EU legislature’s intention, since, although it indicates, in general, that an authorisation in relation to ‘any variations and extensions’ of a medicinal product covered by an initial MA belongs to the same global marketing authorisation as that initial MA, that provision specifies that this also applies as regards an authorisation in relation to any ‘additional strengths, pharmaceutical forms, administration routes [and] presentations’ of such a medicinal product. According to Novartis, if the EU legislature had intended to provide that, in general, all changes that ‘could have’ been authorised as variations or extensions of a medicinal product covered by the initial MA should be regarded as forming part of the global marketing authorisation, it would not have also referred to those specific changes, since they would have been covered by ‘any variations and extensions’.</p>

In the present case, in order to obtain a new MA under a new name, Novartis had to submit a full new application dossier for evaluation under the centralised procedure, on the basis of the criteria established by the legislation in force. According to Novartis, that was the case only because the development represented by Aclasta is a significant therapeutic, scientific or technical innovation. The centralised procedure, whether governed by Regulation No 2309/93 or Regulation No 726/2004, applicable to the present cases, allows the grant of a separate MA as a new medicinal product, with a new name, for certain innovations which could theoretically be authorised as a variation to or an extension of an existing MA. The General Court’s assertion that EU legislation does not determine the issue of when the development of a medicinal product must by authorised through the variation of the existing MA or through a separate MA is therefore incorrect or, in any event, not understandable without further explanation.</p>

The Court held, in paragraph 42 of that judgment, that having the same therapeutic indications is not one of the criteria which must be satisfied in order that two medicinal products may be regarded as essentially similar. That definition led the Court to conclude, in paragraph 43 of that judgment, that an applicant in the abridged procedure may use not only the data provided for the initial medicinal product but also more recent data related to subsequently developed therapeutic indications of that initial product. It follows from that case-law that data submitted in respect of new therapeutic indications do not trigger an independent data protection period.
