Among those provisions, it states that Article 296(2) provides for the possibility of excluding not particular farmers, but categories of farmers and farmers for whom application of the normal VAT arrangements is not likely to give rise to administrative difficulties. Finally, it states that Article 299 of the VAT Directive is concerned only with the setting of the flat-rate compensation percentages to ensure that the flat-rate scheme is fiscally neutral overall and that that article does not allow a particular farmer to be excluded from the scheme.</p>

In the present instance, the Commissioners have failed to identify any group of farmers with sufficient certainty. To accept as a category of farmers within the meaning of Article 296(2) of the VAT Directive the category proposed by the Commissioners would grant the latter a discretion since such a category would result from words which are imprecise or which leave the Commissioners quite free to take their decision by reference to subjective factors.</p>

        <p class="normal">Nevertheless, in the light of the principle of legal certainty, categories of farmers, as referred to in Article 296(2) of the VAT Directive, must be laid down on the basis of objective, clear and precise criteria, by national legislation or, as the case may be, by the executive empowered in that regard by the national legislature. In addition, as the Advocate General has observed in point 36 of his Opinion, those criteria must be laid down in advance, in the sense that the category subject to exclusion must be defined beforehand and in an abstract way, so that any farmer faced with a potential decision about entering the scheme is in a position to assess whether he belongs to the category that is subject to exclusion and whether he will still belong to that category in the future.</p>

Conversely, if the requirements of clarity and certainty in legal situations are not to be disregarded, a category of farmers, within the meaning of Article 296(2) of the VAT Directive, cannot be defined by reference to a criterion which would not permit the persons concerned to conduct an individual analysis of that kind.</p>
