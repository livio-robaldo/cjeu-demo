          By the decision at issue, the Commission found there to have been an infringement of Article 101(1) TFEU and Article 53 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area of 2 May 1992 (
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:1994:001:TOC" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab">OJ 1994 L 1, p. 3</a>
          ) in the bathroom fittings and fixtures sector. That infringement, in which 17 undertakings had allegedly participated, was said to have taken place over various periods between 16 October 1992 and 9 November 2004 and to have taken the form of anticompetitive agreements or concerted practices covering Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria.

The Commission also found that price setting in the bathroom fittings and fixtures industry followed an annual cycle.

The first, known as ‘Euroitalia’, was made up of undertakings, including the appellant, which met two to three times a year during the period between July 1992 and October 2004. Within that group, which had been formed when German manufacturers entered the Italian market, the exchange of information related not only to taps and fittings but also to ceramics. The second informal group of undertakings, known as ‘Michelangelo’, also included the appellant and met on several occasions between the end of 1995 or the start of 1996 and 25 July 2003.

          By its first ground of appeal, concerning paragraphs 118, 120 to 124, 127 and 128 of the judgment under appeal, the appellant submits that the General Court infringed EU law when reviewing the calculation of the fine imposed on it, first, by assessing the gravity of the infringement in question incorrectly, and, secondly, by disregarding the
          <span class="italic">inter partes</span>
          nature of the proceedings and infringing the obligation to state reasons. In particular, the appellant claims that the General Court infringed Article 23(2) and (3) of Regulation No 1/2003 and the principles of personal responsibility, proportionality and equal treatment in the application of penalties relating to action against cartels.

Likewise, the General Court correctly recalled the scope of the principle of proportionality and that of the principle of equal treatment, in paragraphs 120, 127 and 128 of the judgment under appeal. Based on those statements, the General Court should, in the context of its unlimited jurisdiction, have reduced the fine imposed in order to take into account the fact that the appellant’s participation in the alleged infringement was of lesser gravity. The General Court, having noted, in paragraph 119 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had made two errors of assessment in examining the multipliers for the ‘gravity of the infringement’ and the ‘additional amount’, confirmed the amount of the fine, which, in the appellant’s view, is wholly illogical and at variance with the grounds of that judgment.</p>

That part is however the only relevant part for the purposes of the present appeal. Thus, the appellant has referred only to the paragraphs of that judgment which concern the review of legality alone. Moreover, the error of law that the General Court is alleged to have made in the exercise of its unlimited jurisdiction remains obscure. The appellant relies on the principles of proportionality, equal treatment and the principle that the penalty must be specific to the offender in a general and abstract way. In order to be admissible, the appeal should indicate precisely the legal arguments relied upon in support of the application to have the earlier judgment set aside. Furthermore, it follows from the case-law that it is not for the Court of Justice to take the place of the General Court and to rule, in the exercise of its unlimited jurisdiction, on the amount of the fine, unless that amount is not only inappropriate but also excessive to the point of being disproportionate.</p>

In that regard, it adds however, in essence, that, contrary to the view which the General Court seems to have taken, the gravity of such an infringement is not necessarily different if the cartel relates two or three types of products or concerns six Member States rather than one, since it is a serious infringement in the light of the objective of Article 101 TFEU, which is also intended to protect competition as such. Furthermore, the Commission submits that the differences to which the General Court refers, in paragraph 114 of the judgment under appeal, between, first, the appellant, which participated in the infringement only in Italy and in respect of two of the three product subgroups, and, secondly, the other members of the cartel, which participated in that infringement in six Member States in respect of those three product subgroups, were already reflected in the different values relating to turnover, which constitute the basis of the calculation of the fines. Moreover, the appellant’s role was not secondary. In that regard, its participation in the infringement in question went on for 12 years and factors such as Italy’s population and gross domestic product (GDP) were duly taken into consideration in calculating the fine. Accordingly, the principle of equal treatment was not infringed.</p>

          As regards the substance of the first ground of appeal, which alleges that the General Court infringed the principles of personal responsibility, proportionality and equal treatment in calculating the fine, it should be noted, first, that the principle of equal treatment is a general principle of EU law, enshrined in Articles 20 and 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. According to settled case-law, that principle requires that comparable situations must not be treated differently and different situations must not be treated in the same way unless such treatment is objectively justified. Secondly, it is also settled case-law that, when the amount of the fine is determined, there cannot, by the application of different methods of calculation, be any discrimination between the undertakings which have participated in an agreement or a concerted practice contrary to Article 101(1) TFEU. Thirdly, the Court has repeatedly held that the Commission’s practice in previous decisions does not itself serve as a legal framework for the fines imposed in competition matters and that decisions in other cases can give only an indication for the purpose of determining whether there is discrimination (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 July 2013, Ziegler v Commission,

          Next, it is settled case-law that, in the first place, the supervisory task conferred on the Commission by Article 105(1) and Article 106 TFEU not only includes the duty to investigate and punish individual infringements but also encompasses the duty to pursue a general policy designed to apply, in competition matters, the principles laid down by the Treaties and to guide the conduct of undertakings in the light of those principles. That competition policy is characterised by a wide discretion on the part of the Commission, in particular as regards the determination of the amount of fines (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 June 2005, Dansk Rørindustri and Others v Commission,

          In the fourth place, in order to determine the gravity of an infringement, regard must be had to a large number of factors, the nature and importance of which vary according to the type of infringement in question and the particular circumstances of the case. Those factors may, depending on the circumstances, include the conduct of each of the undertakings, the role played by each of them in the establishment of the cartel, the volume and value of the goods in respect of which the infringement was committed and the size and economic power of the undertaking and, consequently, the influence which the undertaking was able to exert on the market (see, to that effect, judgments of 7 June 1983, Musique Diffusion française and Others v Commission,

          Finally, only inasmuch as the Court of Justice considers that the level of the penalty is not merely inappropriate, but also excessive to the point of being disproportionate, would it have to find that the General Court erred in law, due to the inappropriateness of the amount of a fine (judgment of 22 November 2012, E.ON Energie v Commission,

Next, it recalled, in paragraph 146 of that judgment, that the multipliers applicable to the type of infringement in question are consistent with the principle of proportionality, on a scale of 0 to 30% in the case of the multiplier for the ‘gravity of the infringement’ and 15 to 25% in the case of the multiplier for the ‘additional amount’. Finally, the General Court held, in paragraph 147 of the judgment under appeal, which reproduces in essence the findings of paragraphs 118 and 128 of that judgment, that an infringement covering three product subgroups in six Member States is more serious, on account of its geographic scope and the number of product subgroups, than the infringement in which the appellant participated.</p>

The General Court therefore held, in paragraph 149 of that judgment, that the multipliers for the ‘gravity of the infringement’ and the ‘additional amount’ of 15% are appropriate in the light of the findings set out in paragraph 148 of that judgment and the 2006 Guidelines.</p>

          Although, in order to assess the gravity of an infringement and, subsequently, set the fine to be imposed, account may be taken, inter alia, of the geographic extent of that infringement and the number of products it covers, the mere fact that the geographic scope of one infringement is more extensive and that the infringement covers a greater number of products than that of another does not, in itself, necessarily mean that the first infringement, considered as a whole, and in particular in the light of its nature, must be classified as more serious than the second and as therefore justifying the setting of higher multipliers for the ‘gravity of the infringement’ and for the ‘additional amount’ than those used in calculating the fine for the second infringement (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 July 2014, Telefónica and Telefónica de España v Commission,

          Moreover, it follows from the Court’s case-law that the differentiation in the amounts of the fine, which the principle of equal treatment between undertakings requires, need not necessarily be undertaken in the context of setting the multipliers for the ‘gravity of the infringement’ and the ‘additional amount’, in view of the broad discretion enjoyed by the Commission in calculating the fine. The differences and circumstances particular to the undertakings concerned may, if need be, be taken into account at another stage in calculating the fine, such as in the context of adjusting the basic amount in the light of aggravating and mitigating circumstances under points 28 and 29 of the 2006 Guidelines (see, to that effect, judgments of 11 July 2013, Gosselin Group v Commission,

          As the Court has already held, that point pursues the objective of adopting as the starting point for the setting of the fine imposed on an undertaking, an amount which reflects the economic significance of the infringement and the size of the undertaking’s contribution to it (see judgment of 11 July 2013, Team Relocations and Others v Commission,

Moreover, such circumstances are not taken into account automatically and the appellant did not adduce the evidence to make out its case that it played a passive or ‘follow-my-leader’ role in the cartel in question. In any event, it cannot be claimed that the appellant’s role was passive, given that it participated in the anticompetitive practices continuously and very assiduously and that, as established by the General Court in paragraph 52 et seq. of the judgment under appeal, the appellant benefited from information received by other participants in the cartel.</p>

          In that regard, it suffices to recall that, under the second subparagraph of Article 256(1) TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal lies on points of law only. The General Court, consequently, has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence submitted to it. The appraisal of the facts and the assessment of the evidence do not therefore, save where the facts and evidence are distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (see, inter alia, order of 11 June 2015, Faci v Commission,
