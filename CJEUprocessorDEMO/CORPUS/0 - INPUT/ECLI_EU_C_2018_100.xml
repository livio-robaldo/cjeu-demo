          As a preliminary point, it should be noted that Directive 2003/87 has the purpose of establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere to a level that prevents dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system, with the ultimate objective of protection of the environment (see, inter alia, judgment of 8 March 2017, ArcelorMittal Rodange et Schifflange,

          As regards the principle of effectiveness, it should be recalled that, according to settled case-law, every case in which the question arises as to whether a national procedural provision makes the application of EU law impossible or excessively difficult must be analysed by reference to the role of that provision in the procedure, its conduct and its special features, viewed as a whole, before the various national bodies. In that context, it is necessary, inter alia, to take into consideration, where relevant, the protection of the rights of the defence, the principle of legal certainty and the proper conduct of the procedure (see, inter alia, judgment of 20 October 2016, Danqua,

          As regards, more particularly, time limits, the Court has held that, in respect of national rules which come within the scope of EU law, it is for the Member States to establish those time limits in the light of, inter alia, the significance for the parties concerned of the decisions to be taken, the complexities of the procedures and of the legislation to be applied, the number of persons who may be affected and any other public or private interests which must be taken into consideration (see, inter alia, judgment of 20 October 2016, Danqua,

          In that regard, it is clear from the case-law that the setting of time limits must, in principle, satisfy the requirement of effectiveness since it constitutes an application of the fundamental principle of legal certainty which protects both the person and the administration concerned.

It follows that the effective application of that decision in no way obliges the competent national authorities to set aside a procedural rule, such as the mandatory time limit at issue in the main proceedings, in order to enable an operator to correct inaccurate data provided by itself within that time limit.</p>

          ). It is true that, in paragraph 97 of that judgment, the Court held that it was for the Commission to ask the Member States to make the ‘necessary corrections’ to the emission data provided. However, in that case, the error resulted, as is apparent from paragraphs 94 and 95 of that judgment, from the Commission taking into account data sent by the Member States concerning emissions for a period not covered by Article 10a(5)(b) of Directive 2003/87. It is solely because of the seriousness of that error, which substantially affected the uniform cross-sectoral correction factor and, ultimately, the number of allowances to be freely allocated, that the principle of legal certainty did not preclude calling that factor into question
