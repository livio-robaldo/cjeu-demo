        <p class="normal">Immo Chiaradia subsequently appealed against that judgment before the cour d’appel de Mons (Court of Appeal of Mons, Belgium) on 30 June 2014. By its action, it seeks an order for the annulment of the contested tax charge on the ground that no legislative provision prescribes an accounting method or sets up a specific tax regime in respect of the share option at issue. It maintains that it recognised the transaction in accordance with Opinion 167/1 of the [Belgian] Commission des Normes Comptables (Commission for Accounting Standards (CNC)) by opting to consider that the price received by the issuer of an option amounts to remuneration for the liability it incurs during the whole term of the option and that it is only once that option has expired that the purchase price is financially relevant and must be recognised in the profit and loss account.</p>

According to the first approach, the price of the option is recorded immediately in the profit and loss account. According to the second approach, the price is treated as ‘deferred income’ until the date when the option falls due and, therefore, must be recognised as such. The referring court took the view that the second approach was justified and also noted that that approach was preferred by the CNC in accordance with the principle of prudence.</p>

          As is apparent from the Court’s case-law, compliance with the principle that a true and fair view must be given is the primary objective of Directive 78/660. According to that principle, contained in Article 2(3) of that directive, annual accounts must give a true and fair view of the assets and liabilities, financial position and the profit and loss of the company (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 October 2013, GIMLE,

          The Court has interpreted that principle broadly, by considering that it requires, first, that the accounts reflect the activities and transactions which they are supposed to describe and, second, that the accounting information be given in the form judged to be the soundest and most appropriate for satisfying third parties’ needs for information, without harming the interests of the company concerned (judgment of 14 September 1999, DE + ES Bauunternehmung,

          The Court has previously had occasion to rule that the application of the principle that a true and fair view must be given must, as far as possible, be guided by the general principles contained in Article 31 of Directive 78/660, within which the principle of making valuations on a prudent basis set out in Article 31(1)(c) is of particular importance (judgment of 3 October 2013, GIMLE,

The liability arising from a potential increase in the value of the shares underlying the options may, in fact, be mitigated by the amount of the grant date price of the option, which amounts to remuneration for that liability.
