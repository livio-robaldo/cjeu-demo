          As regards the notary’s role when accepting the depositing of payment, the egyes közjegyzői nemperes eljárásokról szóló 2008. évi XLV. törvény (Law No XLV of 2008 relating to non-contentious notarial procedures) (
          <span class="italic">Magyar Közlöny</span>
          2008/94, ‘the Law on non-contentious notarial procedures’) provides that the settlement of a debt through the depositing of payment with a notary has the same effect as a payment into court. According to the relevant provisions of that law, if the notary accepts the payment, he endorses the request with the acceptance formula. The notary is to reject the request or to refuse acceptance thereof if the legal requirements are not fulfilled. He then takes a formal decision. The notary also takes a formal decision in respect of the allocation of the payment. The payment may be handed over only after that decision has become binding.

The fact that, under Hungarian law, an estate which is the subject of a dispute may be transferred by a notary only with provisional title demonstrates that notaries are not empowered to settle a dispute during the procedure on inheritance matters. Nor does the transfer of the estate with full title by a notary entail the exercise of decision-making powers or powers of enforcement, since that transfer presupposes prior consent or agreement between the parties.</p>

In practice, only a small percentage of the orders for payment issued by notaries were challenged.

          Fifth, Hungary argues that the notarial activity consisting in the drafting of authentic instruments is strictly regulated. The official nature of the authentic instrument drawn up by the notary is further attested by the authority to enforce affixed to that instrument when the legal conditions are met. Since that authority makes it possible to enforce a claim by resorting to public measures of enforcement under the same conditions and in accordance with the same procedure as those applicable to the enforcement of a decision by the courts, notaries fulfil the same role as the courts in the context of the settlement and the prevention of disputes. The judgment of 17 June 1999, Unibank (

          ), confirms that only acts relating to the exercise of official authority may be deemed enforceable. Moreover, Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2001:012:TOC" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab">OJ 2001 L 12, p. 1</a>
          ) and Regulation (EC) No 805/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 creating a European Enforcement Order for uncontested claims (

          As far as, in particular, the probative value of notarial instruments is concerned, it must be pointed out that that value derives from the rules on evidence laid down by the Code of Civil Procedure. The probative force conferred by law on a particular document thus has no direct effect on whether the activity which includes the drawing up of the document is in itself directly and specifically connected with the exercise of official authority, as required by the case-law (judgment of 1 December 2011, Commission v Netherlands,

          It cannot therefore be argued that a notarial instrument, because of its probative value, unconditionally binds a court exercising its power of assessment, since, as is not disputed, the judge decides in accordance with his own firm conviction in the light of all the facts and evidence gathered in the course of the judicial proceedings. The principle that the court is unfettered in its assessment of the evidence is, moreover, enshrined in Article 206 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see, by analogy, judgment of 1 December 2011, Commission v Netherlands,

          Nor does the enforceability of an authentic instrument reflect powers held by the notary which are directly and specifically connected with the exercise of official authority. While the notary’s endorsement of the authentic instrument with the authority to enforce does give it enforceable status, that status is based on the intention of the parties to enter into an act or agreement, after its compliance with the law has been checked by the notary, and to make it enforceable (judgment of 24 May 2011, Commission v Belgium,

          ), it must be held that the case which gave rise to that judgment did not relate to the interpretation of the first paragraph of Article 51 TFEU but to the interpretation of Article 50 of the Convention of 27 September 1968 on jurisdiction and the enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters (

          ). Further, the Court held, in paragraphs 15 and 21 of that judgment, that, in order to endow an act with the character of an ‘authentic’ instrument within the meaning of Article 50 of that convention, the involvement of a public authority or any other authority empowered for that purpose by the State of origin is needed.
