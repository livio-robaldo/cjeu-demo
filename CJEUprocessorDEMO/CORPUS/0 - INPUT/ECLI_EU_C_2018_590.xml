Article 23(2) of that regulation refers to infringements which must already have been found and that provision has no bearing on the circumstances in which an infringement may be found under Article 7 of that regulation. That interpretation is supported by the fact that the Commission’s power to find an infringement is not subject to any limitation period and is conferred on the Commission by a part of Regulation No 1/2003 which is separate from the part of that regulation which grants the Commission the power to impose fines. It is also not clear from the case-law that the impossibility of imposing a fine is a precondition for the requirement to demonstrate a legitimate interest.</p>

Second, such a finding, even where no fine is imposed, may harm that undertaking due to its suspensive effect on the limitation periods applicable to actions for damages, laid down in Article 10(4) of Directive 2014/104. Those elements justify the Commission being required, in all decisions finding a past infringement which has been voluntarily terminated by an undertaking, to set out the reasons establishing its legitimate interest in pursuing such an infringement.</p>

The argument put forward by Orange in response, that the first ground in reality refers to paragraphs 74 to 80 of the judgment under appeal or, at the very least, to paragraphs 74 to 76 and 80 of that judgment, is inadmissible, pursuant to Article 169(2) of the Rules of Procedure, since those paragraphs have not been identified in the appeal.</p>

          Those considerations, inasmuch as they refer, in essence, to the Commission’s implied power to find an infringement, stemming from its explicit power to impose fines, were furthermore sufficient to reject the plea put forward before the General Court. Pursuant to Article 23(2)(a) of Regulation No 1/2003, the Commission may by decision impose fines on undertakings and associations of undertakings where, either intentionally or negligently, they infringe Article 101 or 102 TFEU. As recalled in paragraph 49 above, the Court of Justice has already held that the Commission’s power to impose fines where there is an infringement and to take decisions to that effect necessarily implies a power to make a finding that the infringement in question exists (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 March 1983, GVL v Commission,

The Commission’s use of its power to order the infringement to be brought to an end in accordance with that provision, a power which the Commission moreover exercised in Article 3 of the decision at issue in so far as that cessation had not already taken place, and which Orange does not contest, therefore necessarily implies a power to make a finding of that infringement and, accordingly, also does not require the Commission to establish a legitimate interest in doing so (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 March 1983, GVL v Commission,

However, in paragraph 169 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court stated that that recital could only be read as referring, in a general and abstract manner, to the nature of the infringement, misunderstanding the clear meaning of the terms used in that recital, which specifically refers to the effects on competition that had occurred as a result of Orange’s actual behaviour on the market, which is confirmed by the use of a verb conjugated in the past tense. In paragraph 182 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court moreover referred to actual past events, and made reference in particular to recital 902.</p>

In recital 902 of the decision at issue, the Commission at the very least took account of such effects in calculating the fine, which it also admitted in its pleadings before the General Court. The General Court nevertheless incorrectly found that the fact of taking account of the nature of the infringement did not involve taking its likely effects into consideration. However, the likely effects, just like the actual effects, of the conduct in question are essential indicators of the nature of the infringement and, consequently, of its gravity, which cannot be assessed in the abstract. Hence, the General Court was required to examine whether the finding of those likely effects was justified.</p>

Those arguments, concerning the penetration of broadband services in Poland, the Commission’s use of flawed assumptions and methodologies, the impact of mobile telephones on the penetration of broadband services in Poland, the delayed introduction of a reference offer by the Polish NRA, and the pace of broadband service development, were thus not taken into account by the General Court.</p>

          ), that, if, in a decision finding abuse of a dominant position, the Commission carries out an analysis of the capacity of the conduct in question to foreclose, or its potential to distort competition or harm consumers, the General Court is required to examine all of the applicant’s arguments and evidence seeking to call into question the merits of that analysis. That guidance as to the assessment of the potential of a given conduct to restrict competition must be applied by analogy to the assessment of the nature and gravity of an infringement for the purposes of calculating the fine, since the nature and gravity of an infringement largely depends on the capacity of that conduct to foreclose.

Also, as indicated in [recital] 892 [of the decision at issue], [Orange] was aware of the fact that its conduct infringes the law.

Thirdly, the elements set out in those recitals could undoubtedly provide a basis for its reading of the last sentence of that recital set out in paragraph 169, that being even more so because it was also not disputed, as is apparent from paragraphs 124 to 136 and 146 of the judgment under appeal, that the infringement in question had been implemented by Orange; that, in accordance with point 22 of the 2006 Guidelines, the implementation of that infringement was, like the nature of that infringement, the market share of the parties in question and its geographical scope, a relevant element for the purposes of assessing gravity; and, as the General Court noted in paragraph 166 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission had specifically indicated, in recital 906 of the decision at issue, that, in the present case, it had taken into account, in determining the gravity of the infringement in question, the fact that the infringement had been implemented, which Orange does not indeed dispute.</p>

It thus rejected the reasoning given by the Commission in recital 915 of the decision at issue. However, in paragraphs 192 to 209 of that judgment, the General Court departed from the reasoning adopted in that decision for not treating those investments as mitigating circumstances and substituted its own reasoning, even though it had indicated that it was confining itself to reviewing the legality of the decision at issue and did not intend to exercise its unlimited jurisdiction. In so doing, it infringed the rule that, in the context of the review of legality referred to in Article 263 TFEU, it may not substitute its own reasoning for that of the author of the contested act.</p>

          Second, the General Court erred in law and/or committed a manifest error of assessment in determining that the investments in question could not be regarded as compensatory measures. On the one hand, contrary to what was held in paragraphs 199 to 201 of the judgment under appeal, it can be inferred from the judgment of 30 April 2009, Nintendo and Nintendo of Europe v Commission (
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AT%3A2009%3A131&amp;locale=en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch" hreflang="en" class="CourtLink">T‑13/03</a>

          ), and from the decisions of national competition authorities, that the concept of compensation may include benefits in kind rather than money, even if they are indirect. Article 18(3) of Directive 2014/104 confirms this and even encourages such measures to be taken into account in the calculation of fines. On the other hand, it was impossible in the present case to quantify and allocate direct compensation accurately or effectively. Thus, if Orange had not unilaterally made the investments in question, the importance and benefits of which were recognised by the UKE and the alternative operators, few people would have obtained any redress. In that regard, in paragraphs 204 to 206 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court wrongly regarded the beneficial effects referred to therein as deriving from the agreement with the UKE and not from those investments.

No argument concerning the reasons that led Orange to conclude the agreement with the UKE appears in the pleadings or in the decision at issue and the General Court could not, in the context of the review of the legality of the decision at issue, substitute its own reasoning for that of the Commission without effecting an unlawful substitution of grounds and a breach of the principle of fairness and of the rights of the defence.

That statement contradicts the finding made in paragraph 202 of that judgment, since the same investments could not simultaneously be due to the threat of regulatory intervention and also an incident of normal business life. Paragraph 204 of that judgment also distorts the evidence because, in focusing upon events which had taken place during the infringement period, it gave the impression that, since regulatory measures had not had the intended results, no benefits flowed from subsequent investments. In any event, those investments were not made with a view to a return, some of them not being economically viable, but in order to remedy the harm suffered by those adversely affected by the conduct found to constitute an infringement.</p>

          In the first place, in so far as, by the third ground, Orange submits that the General Court erred in law by substituting its own reasoning for that of the Commission in the decision at issue in rejecting the classification of the investments in question as a mitigating circumstance, within the meaning of point 29 of the 2006 Guidelines, thus infringing the limits imposed upon it as regards its review of legality, it should be recalled that the system of judicial review of Commission decisions relating to proceedings under Articles 101 and 102 TFEU consists in a review of the legality of the acts of the institutions for which provision is made in Article 263 TFEU, which may be supplemented, pursuant to Article 261 TFEU and at the request of applicants, by the General Court’s exercise of unlimited jurisdiction with regard to the penalties imposed in that regard by the Commission (judgment of 21 January 2016, Galp Energía España and Others v Commission,

          By contrast, when they exercise their unlimited jurisdiction laid down in Article 261 TFEU and Article 31 of Regulation No 1/2003, the EU Courts are empowered, in addition to merely reviewing the legality of the penalty, to substitute their own assessment in relation to the determination of the amount of that penalty for that of the Commission, the author of the act in which that amount was initially fixed. Consequently, the EU Courts may vary the contested act, even without annulling it, in order to cancel, reduce or increase the amount of the fine imposed, that jurisdiction being exercised by taking into account all the factual circumstances (see, to that effect, judgments of 15 October 2002, Limburgse Vinyl Maatschappij and Others v Commission,

          In those paragraphs, the General Court quoted certain sections of the agreement with the UKE and inferred from them that the investments made by Orange could not be regarded as compensatory measures comparable to those which had been accepted by the Commission in the case giving rise to the judgment of the General Court of 30 April 2009, Nintendo and Nintendo of Europe v Commission, (

          ), or to those which had been favourably assessed by the competition authority of the United Kingdom. The General Court also noted that the commitments defined in the agreement with the UKE were motivated by Orange’s desire to avoid functional separation and it found that those investments were a normal part of business life, given that they benefited, above all, Orange itself. The General Court furthermore rejected the PIIT’s arguments, noting that the documents it submitted established that some of the beneficial effects for the alternative operators and end-users stemming from the agreement with the UKE and from the investments it planned had to be attributed to that agreement in itself and not to the investments in question in particular, and it noted that the Commission had indeed taken account of the improvement of the situation on the relevant market resulting from the change in Orange’s conduct that followed the signature of that agreement, given that the Commission had taken the date of that signature as the date on which the infringement had ended.

          Moreover, inasmuch as, by their heads of claim, Orange and the PIIT ask the Court, in the alternative, to reduce the fine imposed by the decision at issue to the extent which the Court considers appropriate, it is sufficient to note that those claims are necessarily based on the same grounds as their main claims and must, consequently, also be rejected for the reasons set out in the present judgment (see, by analogy, judgment of 1 June 1978, Mulcahy v Commission,

          Finally, inasmuch as, by their heads of claim in the further alternative, Orange and the PIIT ask the Court to remit the decision relating to the fine to the Commission and to order the Commission to adopt a new decision relating to the fine, it is sufficient to note that, in the context of an appeal, the Court has no power to issue directions to the institutions (see, to that effect, judgments of 8 July 1999, DSM v Commission,
