However, it is unclear whether the situation at issue in the main proceedings involves a conflict of laws. That situation concerns a ship charter contract, concluded in Italy between two companies under Italian law whose registered offices are located in that Member State, for the transport of chemical substances by vessels flying the Italian flag. On the other hand, that contract is drafted in English and contains a clause stating that English law is the chosen law and a clause choosing the jurisdiction of the London Maritime Arbitrators Association.</p>

          As regards, more specifically, the objective pursued by Article 13 of Regulation No 1346/2000, it is clear from the case-law that the aim of that article is to protect the legitimate expectations of a person who has benefited from an act detrimental to all the creditors by providing that the act will continue to be governed, even after insolvency proceedings have been opened, by the law that was applicable at the date on which it was concluded, namely the

          In those circumstances, it must be stated that neither the wording of, nor the aims pursued by Article 13 of Regulation No 1346/2000 lead to the conclusion that the form and the time-limit in which a party must rely on that article in court proceedings are determined by the
          <span class="italic">lex causae</span>
          . Regulation No 1346/2000 and, in particular, Article 13 do not aim to protect the litigant against the usual risk of having to defend himself in such proceedings, whether that be before the courts of the Member State on whose territory the person concerned resides or before the courts of another Member State, nor therefore, against the procedural law applied by the competent jurisdiction.

          Accordingly, the answer to the first question is that Article 13 of Regulation No 1346/2000 must be interpreted to the effect that the form and the time-limit in which a person benefiting from an act that is detrimental to all the creditors must raise an objection under that article, in order to challenge an action to have that act set aside in accordance with the
          <span class="italic">lex fori concursus</span>
          , and the question whether that article may also be applied by the competent court of its own motion, if necessary, after the time-limit allowed to the party concerned has expired, fall within the procedural law of the Member State on whose territory the dispute is pending. That law must not, however, be less favourable than the law governing similar domestic situations (principle of equivalence) and must not make it excessively difficult or impossible in practice to exercise the rights conferred by EU law (principle of effectiveness), that being a matter for the referring court to determine.

          By its second question, the referring court asks whether Article 13 of Regulation No 1346/2000 must be interpreted to the effect that the party bearing the burden of proof must show that, in the specific circumstances of the case, the
          <span class="italic">lex causae</span>
          does not provide, in general or in the abstract, any means to challenge an act which was considered detrimental, or to the effect that that party must show that, where the
          <span class="italic">lex causae</span>
          allows an act of that type to be challenged, the conditions to be met in order for that challenge to be upheld, and which differ from those of the

        <p class="normal">
          In that regard, the Court has held, first of all, that it is clear from the objective pursued by Article 13 of Regulation No 1346/2000, as recalled in paragraph 30 above, that the application of that article requires that all the circumstances of the case be taken into account. There cannot be legitimate expectations where, after insolvency proceedings have been opened, the validity of an act is to be assessed without regard being had to those circumstances whereas, where such proceedings are not opened, such circumstances would need to be taken into account (judgment of 15 October 2015, Nike European Operations Netherlands,

          Next, the Court held that the obligation to interpret strictly the exception laid down in Article 13 of Regulation No 1346/2000 precludes a broad interpretation of the scope of that article which would allow a person who has benefited from an act detrimental to all the creditors to avoid the application of the
          <span class="italic">lex fori concursus</span>
          by relying solely, in a purely abstract manner, on the unchallengeable character of the act at issue on the basis of a provision of the

          Finally, the Court also held that, for the purposes of the application of Article 13 of Regulation No 1346/2000 and in the event that the defendant in an action relating to the voidness, voidability or unenforceability of an act relies on a provision of the
          <span class="italic">lex causae</span>
          under which that act can be challenged only in the circumstances provided for in that provision, it is for that defendant to plead that those circumstances do not exist and to bear the burden of proof in that regard (judgment of 15 October 2015, Nike European Operations Netherlands,

          Accordingly, the Court implicitly excluded an interpretation whereby that defendant would have to show that the
          <span class="italic">lex causae</span>
          does not provide, in general or in the abstract, any means to challenge the act in question, an interpretation which would, moreover, be excessively narrow, given the fact that such means of challenging the act almost always exist, at least in the abstract, and which would therefore deprive Article 13 of Regulation No 1346/2000 of its effectiveness.

          In that context, it is apparent from well-established case-law that a finding of abuse requires a combination of objective and subjective elements. First, with regard to the objective element, that finding requires that it must be apparent from a combination of objective circumstances that, despite formal observance of the conditions laid down by Community rules, the purpose of those rules has not been achieved. Second, such a finding requires a subjective element, namely that it must be apparent from a number of objective factors that the essential aim of the transactions concerned is to obtain an undue advantage. The prohibition of abuse is not relevant where the economic activity carried out may have some explanation other than the mere attainment of an advantage (judgment of 28 July 2016, Kratzer,

          Thus, as regards the application of Article 13 of Regulation No 1346/2000 in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, that application may be disregarded only in a situation where it would appear objectively that the objective pursued by that application, in this context, of ensuring the legitimate expectation of the parties in the applicability of specific legislation, has not been achieved, and that the contract was made subject to the law of a specific Member State artificially, that is to say, with the primary aim, not of actually making that contract subject to the legislation of the chosen Member State, but of relying on the law of that Member State in order to exempt the contract, or the acts which took place in the performance of the contract, from the application of the

                  Article 13 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on insolvency proceedings must be interpreted to the effect that the form and the time-limit in which a person benefiting from an act that is detrimental to all the creditors must raise an objection under that article, in order to challenge an action to have that act set aside in accordance with the

That law must not, however, be less favourable than the law governing similar domestic situations (principle of equivalence) and must not make it excessively difficult or impossible in practice to exercise the rights conferred by EU law (principle of effectiveness), that being a matter for the referring court to determine.
