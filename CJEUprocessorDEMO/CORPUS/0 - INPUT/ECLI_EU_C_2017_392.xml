        <p class="normal">On 10 March 2011, the Customs office of destination found a loss of cargo of 2488 kg due to the fact that the lower unloading device of one of the wagon tanks in question had not been correctly closed or had been damaged. As the documents relating to the presentation of missing cargo and to completion of the transit procedure without irregularity had not been presented to the customs office and in the absence of evidence that the cargo deficit resulted from an act by the sender, the VID adopted a decision by which it calculated the LDz’s customs debt in the sum of Latvian Lats (LVL) 63.26 (about EUR 90.01) and its VAT debt in the sum of LVL 228.02 (about EUR 324.44). The LDz challenged that decision. The Director-General upheld that decision by a decision of 16 September 2011.</p>

Furthermore, the LDz submitted that the VID had not taken into account the fact that the cargo deficit found had resulted from the total destruction or irretrievable loss of the goods concerned as a result of the actual nature of the goods or unforeseeable circumstances or

That court states in that regard that, on the one hand, the VID considers that paragraph 2.2 of the ‘Transit manual’ of the Commission’s Directorate-General ‘Taxation and Customs Union’ (Working Document Taxud/2033/2008-LV Rev. 4) of 15 September 2009 applies in all cases where a deficit in goods is found by the customs office of destination, whilst, on the other hand, the LDz emphasises the findings establishing, in the present case, that there was a leak of solvent from the tank concerned for a technical reason and refers to the measures taken to repair that damage.</p>

          Having regard to the foregoing considerations, the answer to the second question is that Article 204(1)(a) of the Customs Code must be interpreted as meaning that where the total volume of goods placed under the external Community transit procedure has not been produced at the customs office of destination provided for in that procedure owing to the total destruction or irretrievable loss of some of the goods, proven to a satisfactory standard, that situation, which constitutes non-fulfilment of one of the obligations under that procedure, namely, to produce goods intact at the customs office of destination, gives rise, in principle, to a customs debt on importation for the part of the goods which was not produced at that customs office. It is for the national court to determine whether a circumstance such as damage to an unloading device meets, in the present case, the criteria of ‘
          <span class="italic">force majeure</span>
          ’ or an ‘unforeseeable circumstance’, within the meaning of Article 206(1) of the Customs Code, namely, whether it is an abnormal circumstance for a trader in the business of the transportation of liquid substances and extraneous to that trader, and whether the consequences could not have been avoided even if all due care had been exercised. In the context of that determination, that court must, in particular, take into account compliance, by operators such as the principal and the carrier, with the rules and obligations in force regarding the technical condition of tanks and the safety of transportation of liquid substances such as a solvent.

          Under Article 2(1)(d) of the VAT Directive, the importation of goods is subject to VAT. Article 70 of the VAT Directive lays down the principle that the chargeable event occurs and the tax becomes chargeable at the moment when the goods are imported. Thus, Article 71(1) of the VAT Directive provides, in its first subparagraph, that, where, on entry into the European Union, goods are placed under the external Community transit procedure, the chargeable event occurs and the tax becomes chargeable only when the goods cease to be covered by that procedure (see, to that effect, the judgment of 11 July 2013, Harry Winston,

          In that regard, the Court has previously held that Article 204 of the code is intended to ensure that the customs legislation is correctly applied. Under Articles 96(1) and 204(1) of that code, the principal — in his capacity as holder in the external Community transit procedure — is the debtor of the customs debt incurred due to the failure to observe the provisions governing that procedure. The liability thus imposed upon the principal is intended to ensure the diligent and uniform application of the provisions relating to that procedure and the proper functioning of transit operations in order to protect the financial interests of the European Union and its Member States (judgment of 15 July 2010, DSV Road,
