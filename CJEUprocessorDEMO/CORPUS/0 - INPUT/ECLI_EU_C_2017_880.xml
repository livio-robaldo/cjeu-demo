          In the second place, it follows from Article 8(1) of the TIR Convention that, under the guarantee contract, guaranteeing associations undertake to pay the customs duties due from the persons directly liable and are, in that regard, jointly and severally liable with those persons for the payment of such sums, even though, under Article 8(7) of that convention, the competent authorities must so far as possible, require payment from the person directly liable before making a claim against the guaranteeing association (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 October 2006, Commission v Belgium,

          As the Advocate General observes, in essence, in point 44 of his Opinion, the existence of such liability means that the guaranteeing association is itself a debtor, together with the persons directly liable, in respect of the sums in question. It follows, furthermore, from the very nature of joint and several liability that each debtor is liable for the full amount of the debt and the creditor is, in principle, free to claim payment of that debt from one or more of the debtors as he chooses (see, to that effect, judgment of 18 May 2017, Latvijas dzelzceļš,
