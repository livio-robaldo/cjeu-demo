The judgment adds that, ‘also, it is on account of that objective that that law provides that ownership of land cannot be acquired for the purposes of investment for the future, that is to say, in order to obtain a capital gain that would result from the increase of the price of land,’ and that, ‘as is apparent from the preamble to that law, other objectives of legal policy which led to the drafting of that law were, inter alia, that the sale of agricultural and forestry land and the creation of mortgages over such land for the purpose of securing loans effectively facilitate the working thereof by newly set up undertakings, that properties be created of a size that enables viable and competitive agricultural production, that the organisation of agriculture based on ownership not be threatened by the harmful effects of the fragmentation of land, and that every farmer be able to pursue peacefully his agricultural production activity’.</p>

That judgment explains that, ‘in its operation, the new regime cannot, so far as concerns ownership, usufruct and the use of productive land, fail to incorporate the requirement that the situations specified in the property register must reflect legal relationships that are consistent with the Fundamental Law’. Consequently, according to the judgment, ‘it was necessary to adopt measures preventing the application of legal arrangements known, in everyday language, as “pocket contracts” and, therefore, to provide that it is not possible to continue to apply rights or obligations, or any legal remedies, on the basis of existing legal relationships, so as to escape the previous prohibitions and restrictions concerning the acquisition of ownership’.</p>

The Hungarian legislature thus prescribed, by legislative measures, the effects of the alleged invalidity of those contracts, without however showing that that legislation was in the public interest; it also denied the persons concerned the possibility of proving that their contracts were valid in an administrative procedure and compromised their right, laid down in Article 47 of the Charter, to a fair hearing.</p>

          It should be recalled that, according to settled case-law, national courts have the widest discretion to refer to the Court of Justice questions of interpretation of relevant provisions of EU law and that a rule of national law cannot prevent a national court from using that discretion. Such a discretion is an inherent part of the system of cooperation between the national courts and the Court established in Article 267 TFEU and of the functions of the court responsible for the application of EU law which are entrusted by that provision to the national courts (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 April 2016, PFE,

The Court has thus held in particular that the existence of a rule of national law whereby courts against whose decisions there is a judicial remedy are bound on points of law by the rulings of a court superior to them cannot, on the basis of that fact alone, deprive the lower courts of that discretion (judgment of 22 June 2010, Melki and Abdeli,

          The existence of any such disadvantage must be assessed by comparing the group formed by nationals of Member States other than Hungary directly or indirectly holding rights of usufruct over agricultural land and the group formed by Hungarian nationals directly or indirectly holding such rights of usufruct and by determining the proportion of each of those groups affected by the measure extinguishing rights that was enacted. In the light of the matters referred to in paragraphs 68 to 70 above, it appears likely that that measure affected a markedly higher proportion of the members of the first of those groups than of the second (see, to that effect, judgment of 9 February 1999, Seymour-Smith and Perez,

          As is apparent from the Court’s case-law, measures such as those at issue in the main proceedings, which restrict the free movement of capital while giving rise in all likelihood to indirect discrimination, are permissible only if they are justified, on the basis of objective considerations independent of the origin of the capital concerned, by overriding reasons in the public interest and if they observe the principle of proportionality, a condition which requires them to be appropriate for ensuring the attainment of the objective legitimately pursued and not to go beyond what is necessary in order for it to be attained (see, to that effect, judgments of 25 October 2007, Geurts and Vogten,

Thus, that legislation seeks to limit the ownership of productive land to the persons who work it and to prevent its acquisition for purely speculative purposes, and also to enable it to be farmed by new undertakings, to facilitate the creation of properties of a size that enables viable and competitive agricultural production, and to prevent a fragmentation of agricultural land as well as migration from rural areas and depopulation of the countryside.</p>

          As to those submissions, the Court has accepted that national legislation may restrict the free movement of capital on the ground of objectives such as those of preserving the farming of agricultural land by means of owner-occupancy and ensuring that agricultural property is lived on and farmed predominantly by the owners, as well as of preserving a permanent population in rural areas as a town and country planning measure and of encouraging a reasonable use of the available land by resisting pressure on land. These objectives are indeed consistent with those of the common agricultural policy which, under Article 39(1)(b) TFEU, aims ‘to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community’ and in the working-out of which, according to Article 39(2)(a) TFEU, account must be taken of ‘the particular nature of agricultural activity, which results from the social structure of agriculture and from structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions’ (see, to that effect, judgment of 25 January 2007, Festersen,

Thus, if a Member State wishes to rely on an objective that is capable of justifying an obstacle to the free movement of capital arising from a national restrictive measure, it is under a duty to supply the court called upon to rule on that question with all the evidence capable of enabling that court to be satisfied that that measure does indeed fulfil the requirements arising from the principle of proportionality (see, by analogy, judgment of 8 September 2010, Stoß and Others,

However, and in any event, such reference to the general rules of civil law places on those usufructuaries the burden of having to pursue the recovery, by means of procedures that may prove lengthy and expensive, of any compensation which might be payable to them by the landowner. Indeed, those rules of civil law, which are moreover not mentioned by the legislation at issue in the main proceedings, do not make it easy to determine whether compensation will in fact be obtainable at the end of such procedures or disclose the nature of the compensation. Nor do the usufructuaries have the assurance that they will be able to obtain full compensation for the loss that they have sustained, in particular in the event of insolvency of the owner of the land to which the usufruct relates.</p>

        <p class="normal">According to the Hungarian Government, the continuance of situations of that kind was contrary to public policy and it was therefore incumbent upon the State to remedy them. It states that the Hungarian legislature, instead of having recourse to the most classical approach, consisting in declaring, following a judicial examination on a case-by-case basis, that the contracts at issue were void, decided to remedy by force of law the deficiencies of the legal rule previously laid down or, indeed, the absence of any relevant rule of law. The Hungarian Government adds that that approach was favoured, in particular for budgetary reasons and reasons relating to the economising of judicial resources, in the light both of the large number of cases that potentially were to give rise to such an examination and of the need to amend the legislation relating to the acquisition of agricultural land before 1 May 2014, the date on which the transitional regime resulting from the 2003 Act of Accession was to expire.</p>

To that end, it is incumbent upon the Court solely to determine whether or not the legislation at issue in the main proceedings is capable of being justified by a desire to combat practices which were allegedly designed to circumvent national law and, consequently, as the Hungarian Government contends, of being justified on grounds of public policy within the meaning of Article 65 TFEU.</p>

          Accordingly, the view cannot be taken that such legislation pursues the specific aim of combating conduct that consisted in the creation of artificial arrangements aimed at circumventing national legislation relating to acquisition of agricultural land. It should, moreover, be noted that such legislation seeks, generally, to cancel by operation of law all rights of usufruct held by legal persons, or by natural persons in so far as they cannot demonstrate a close family tie with the owner of the agricultural land, without in any way linking those cancellations to the reasons which led the persons concerned to make such acquisitions (see, by analogy, judgment of 12 December 2002, Lankhorst-Hohorst,
