        <p class="normal">By decision of 9 December 2013, the SPEE granted Ms Espadas Recio 420 days’ unemployment benefit. In deciding on that period of 420 days, the SPEE relied on the fact that, in accordance with the combined provisions of Article 210 of the LGSS and Article 3(4) of RD 625/1985, in the case of part-time work, although the duration of the unemployment benefit is based on the number of days for which contributions were paid in the preceding six years, account was to be taken only of the days actually worked, in this case 1387, and not the six years of contributions in their totality.</p>

        <p class="normal">Ms Espadas Recio’s claim concerns the duration of employment benefits granted to her by the SPEE. She claims that, because she worked for six consecutive years, during which contributions were paid for 30 or 31 days per month (for a total of 2160 days), she is entitled to unemployment benefit for a duration of 720 days rather than the 420 days she was granted, that is to say, three fifths of the maximum duration. In her view, excluding the days not worked for the purpose of calculating her unemployment benefit establishes a difference in treatment to the detriment of ‘vertical’ part-time workers. Part-time work is called ‘vertical’ when the person performing it concentrates his working hours on certain working days of the week, and ‘horizontal’ when the person performing it works on every working day of the week. In the present case, Ms Espadas Recio’s hours of work were concentrated mainly on three days per week.</p>

The same court nevertheless notes that, in the case of a ‘vertical’ part-time worker such as the applicant, the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings permit only the days worked to be taken into account, and not the entire six-year contribution period. Thus, the mandatory contribution days would not be taken into account in full for the purpose of determining the duration of the unemployment benefit.</p>

          As regards the question whether legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings constitutes indirect discrimination against women, as the referring court suggests, it is apparent from the settled case-law of the Court that indirect discrimination arises when a national measure, although neutrally formulated, works to the disadvantage of far more women than men (judgments of 20 October 2011, Brachner,

          ), in which the Court held that the legislation at issue, concerning the determination of the basis for the calculation of a pension for total permanent invalidity, did not involve discrimination within the meaning of Article 4(1) of Directive 79/7. In that judgment, the Court considered, on the one hand, that it did not have irrefutable statistical information regarding the number of part-time workers who had had a gap in their contributions or showing that that group of workers was principally made up of women (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 April 2015, Cachaldora Fernández,

It can be deduced from that information that a much greater proportion of women than of men are adversely affected by the national measure at issue in the main proceedings.</p>

          A measure of such a nature is contrary to Article 4(1) of Directive 79/7, unless it is justified by objective factors unrelated to any discrimination on grounds of sex.

Thus, since the right to unemployment benefits and the duration of that benefit are based solely on the period during which an employee has worked or was registered in the social security system, it is necessary, in order to observe the principle of proportionality, for account to be taken only of the days actually worked.</p>
