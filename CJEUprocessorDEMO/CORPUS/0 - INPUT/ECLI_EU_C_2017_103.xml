It states, first, that the starch content of the product at issue exceeds 5% of its total weight and, secondly, that the starch is not added because of its nutritional properties but serves simply as a processing aid in order to improve the suitability of calcium carbonate for use in calcium tablets.

In accordance with the Explanatory Notes to the HS on Chapter 38, the mere presence of foodstuffs or other substances with nutritive value, such as the modified starch in the present case, in a mixture would not suffice to exclude the mixture from the scope of Chapter 38 of the CN, given that, according to those Explanatory Notes, a substance having a nutritive value that incidental to its function as a processing aid is not regarded as a substance with nutritive value.

          First of all, it must be pointed out that, when the Court is requested to give a preliminary ruling on a matter of tariff classification, its task is to provide the national court with guidance on the criteria which will enable the latter to classify the products at issue correctly in the CN, rather than to effect that classification itself, a fortiori since the Court does not necessarily have available to it all the information which is essential in that regard. In any event the national court is in a better position to do so (judgment of 17 September 2015, Kyowa Hakko Europe,

          Next, it should be noted that, according to the Court’s settled case-law, in the interests of legal certainty and ease of verification, the decisive criterion for the classification of goods for customs purposes is in general to be sought in their objective characteristics and properties as defined in the wording of the relevant heading of the CN and in the section or chapter notes (judgment of 17 February 2016, Salutas Pharma,

          Thus, the chapter notes to the CN constitute important means for ensuring the uniform application of the common customs tariff and provide, as such, useful information for its interpretation.

          In the present case, the product at issue in the main proceedings is a mixture composed of a chemical product, calcium carbonate, and a substance with nutritive value, modified starch. In this connection, the Court has held that that the term ‘substances with nutritive value’ may apply to chemical products (judgment of 30 January 1992, SuCrest,
