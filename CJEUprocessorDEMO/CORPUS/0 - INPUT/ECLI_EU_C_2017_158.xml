In accordance with that contract, TNT entrusted to Mr Pérez Retamero the task of delivering goods on the territory of Catalonia (Spain), processing documents for customs clearance (in accordance with precise instructions), loading, stowing, unloading, and offloading the goods carried and, finally, arranging for the collection of amounts payable for dispatches. That contract provided furthermore that TNT could change, wholly or partly, and unilaterally, the principles and rules applicable to transport services. A mobile phone equipped with a card supplied by Vodafone was provided to Mr Pérez Retamero so that he could perform his work. Also in accordance with that contract, Mr Pérez Retamero had to take out a transport insurance policy and, in any event, assume responsibility for loss or destruction of the goods and for delivery delays. The initial term of the contract was fixed at six months. However, that contract could be extended for successive periods of six months. The remuneration for services provided by the interested party consisted of a lump sum amount payable for each day covered and paid monthly. The contract at issue stipulated that the vehicle used had to display the colours and advertising chosen by TNT. Mr Pérez Retamero also declared that he was licenced to carry on a transport activity. Annex I to that contract provided that the carrier would have a supervisor.</p>

          According to settled case-law, the procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU is a means of cooperation between the Court of Justice and national courts. It follows that it is for the national courts alone which are seised of the case and are responsible for the judgment to be delivered to determine, in view of the special features of each case, both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable them to give their judgment and the relevance of the questions which they put to the Court (see, inter alia, judgments of 17 July 1997, Leur-Bloem,

          Nevertheless, the Court may refuse to rule on a question referred for a preliminary ruling by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of European Union law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to enable it to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (see, inter alia, judgments of 11 July 2006, Chacón Navas,
