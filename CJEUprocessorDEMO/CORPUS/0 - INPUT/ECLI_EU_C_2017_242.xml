          )] establishes the legislative framework for the handling of waste in the Community. It defines key concepts such as waste, recovery and disposal and puts in place the essential requirements for the management of waste, notably an obligation for an establishment or undertaking carrying out waste management operations to have a permit or to be registered and an obligation for the Member States to draw up waste management plans. It also establishes major principles such as an obligation to handle waste in a way that does not have a negative impact on the environment or human health, an encouragement to apply the waste hierarchy and, in accordance with the polluter-pays principle, a requirement that the costs of disposing of waste must be borne by the holder of waste, by previous holders or by the producers of the product from which the waste came.’

Furthermore, the recovery of waste and the use of recovered materials should be encouraged in order to conserve natural resources.

          So far as concerns the financing of the cost of management and disposal of urban waste, inasmuch as a service provided on a collective basis to a body of ‘holders’ is involved, the Member States are obliged, under Article 15 of Directive 2008/98, to ensure that, in principle, all the users of that service, in their capacity as ‘holders’ within the meaning of Article 3 of that directive, collectively bear the overall cost of disposing of the waste (see, by analogy, judgment of 16 July 2009, Futura Immobiliare and Others,

          As EU law currently stands, there is no legislation adopted on the basis of Article 192 TFEU imposing a specific method upon the Member States for financing the cost of the disposal of urban waste, with the result that the cost may, in accordance with the choice of the Member State concerned, equally well be financed by means of a tax or of a fee or in any other manner. Accordingly, recourse to criteria of invoicing based on the volume of the container provided for users, calculated on the basis of, inter alia, the surface area of the property which they occupy and of its use, may provide a means of calculating the costs of disposing of that waste and allocating those costs among the various holders, in so far as this parameter is such as to have a direct impact on the amount of those costs (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 July 2009, Futura Immobiliare and Others,

          Although, as the relevant EU law currently stands, the competent national authorities have a wide discretion with regard to determining how prices are calculated, such as for waste management costs and the additional levy at issue in the main proceedings, it is nonetheless incumbent on the referring court, on the basis of the facts and points of law placed before it, to determine whether the price charged and that additional levy do not result in the imposition on certain ‘holders’ of costs that are manifestly disproportionate to the volume or to the type of waste that they are liable to produce (see, by analogy, judgment of 16 July 2009, Futura Immobiliare and Others,

It is, however, incumbent on the referring court to verify, on the basis of the matters of fact and law placed before it, whether this results in the imposition on certain ‘holders’ of costs which are manifestly disproportionate to the volumes or nature of the waste that they are liable to produce.
