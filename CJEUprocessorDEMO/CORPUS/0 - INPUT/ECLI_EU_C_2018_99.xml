          Having regard to the objectives pursued by Directive 92/85 and, more specifically, to those pursued by Article 10 of that directive, the protection granted by that provision to workers who are pregnant and who have recently given birth or who are breastfeeding precludes both the taking of a decision to dismiss as well as the steps of preparing for the dismissal, such as searching for and finding a permanent replacement for the relevant employee on the grounds of the pregnancy and/or the birth of a child (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 October 2007, Paquay,
