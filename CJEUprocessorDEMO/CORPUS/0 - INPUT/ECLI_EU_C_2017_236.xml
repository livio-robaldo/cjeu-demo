          In support of that request, Rosneft argues, first, that the analysis carried out in this case by the Advocate General, in his Opinion of 31 May 2016, is in error with respect to the obligation incumbent on the Council to state reasons for the adoption of the restrictive measures at issue. That analysis also reveals a misunderstanding of the differences that exist between those restrictive measures and those adopted by the European Union in relation to the Iranian nuclear programme and it is therefore necessary that the Court seek further information on that subject. Further, the Advocate General’s analysis of the concept of ‘legislative acts’, within the meaning of Article 31 TEU, differs in its approach from that recommended in the Opinion of Advocate General Wahl in the case that gave rise to the judgment of 19 July 2016, H v Council and Commission (

          ), delivered after the date of the oral hearing in the present case. Last, the oral procedure should be re-opened since both the jurisdiction of the Court and the enforceability of its judgments are likely to change rapidly following the result of the referendum which took place on 23 June 2016 in the United Kingdom on that State’s membership of the European Union.

          In that regard, it must be borne in mind that when a question on the validity of a measure adopted by the institutions of the European Union is raised before a national court or tribunal, it is for that court or tribunal to decide whether a preliminary ruling on the matter is necessary to enable it to give judgment and consequently whether it should ask the Court to rule on that question.

          ), it must however be recalled that the Treaties explicitly establish two exceptions to that rule. First, both the last sentence of the second subparagraph of Article 24(1) TEU and the second paragraph of Article 275 TFEU provide that the Court has jurisdiction to monitor compliance with Article 40 TEU. Second, the last sentence of the second subparagraph of Article 24(1) TEU confers on the Court jurisdiction to review the legality of certain decisions referred to in the second paragraph of Article 275 TFEU. The latter provision confers on the Court jurisdiction to give rulings on actions, brought subject to the conditions laid down in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, concerning the review of the legality of Council decisions, adopted on the basis of provisions relating to the CFSP, which provide for restrictive measures against natural or legal persons.

Second, the aim of the question is to ascertain whether the Court has jurisdiction to review the legality of restrictive measures against natural or legal persons, the adoption of those measures being prescribed by that decision, not only where those persons bring an action for the annulment of those measures before the Courts of the European Union, under Articles 256 and 263 TFEU, but also in circumstances where the Court is seised, under the preliminary ruling procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU, of a request by a national court or tribunal which has doubts as to the validity of such measures.</p>

In establishing this general jurisdiction, Article 19(3)(b) TEU states, further, that the Court is to give preliminary rulings, at the request of national courts or tribunals, on, inter alia, the validity of acts adopted by the institutions of the European Union.</p>

In that regard, the last sentence of the second subparagraph of Article 24(1) TEU refers to the second paragraph of Article 275 TFEU in order to determine not the type of procedure under which the Court may review the legality of certain decisions, but rather the type of decisions whose legality may be reviewed by the Court, within any procedure that has as its aim such a review of legality.</p>

          That conclusion is confirmed by the essential objective of Article 267 TFEU, which is to ensure that EU law is applied uniformly by the national courts and tribunals, that objective being equally vital both for the review of legality of decisions prescribing the adoption of restrictive measures against natural or legal persons and for other European Union acts. With respect to such decisions, differences between courts or tribunals of the Member States as to the validity of a European Union act would be liable to jeopardise the very unity of the European Union legal order and to undermine the fundamental requirement of legal certainty (see, by analogy, judgments of 22 February 1990, Busseni,

Rosneft’s fourth ground is that there was a breach of the principle of equal treatment.

Article 289(3) TFEU provides that legal acts adopted by legislative procedure constitute legislative acts. The exclusion of the right to adopt legislative acts in the area of the CFSP reflects the intention that that policy should be subject to specific rules and procedures, as is clear from Article 24 TEU. Since those rules and procedures, defined by, inter alia, the provisions relating to the CFSP within Title V, Chapter 2, of the EU Treaty, establish a specific division of tasks among the institutions of the Union in that field, it follows that the adoption of legislative acts, within the meaning of Article 289(3) TFEU, is, in that context, necessarily excluded.</p>

          That said, while the statement of reasons required by Article 296 TFEU must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning followed by the institution which adopted the measure in such a way as to enable the person concerned to ascertain the reasons for the measures and to enable the court having jurisdiction to exercise its power of review, that statement of reasons must, however, be adapted to the nature of the act at issue and to the context in which it was adopted. In that regard, it is not necessary for the reasoning to go into all the relevant facts and points of law, since the question whether the statement of reasons is sufficient must be assessed with regard not only to its wording but also to its context and to all the legal rules governing the matter in question and, in particular, in the light of the interest which the addressees of the measure may have in obtaining explanations. Consequently, the reasons given for a measure adversely affecting a person are sufficient if that measure was adopted in a context which was known to that person and which enables him to understand the scope of the measure concerning him (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 November 2012, Council v Bamba,

In accordance with the objective of increasing the costs of the actions of the Russian Federation vis‑à‑vis Ukraine, Article 1(2)(b) of Decision 2014/512 establishes restrictions against certain oil sector entities controlled by the Russian State on the basis of, inter alia, their total assets, with an estimated value of 1000 billion Russian Roubles. Since both the political background at the time of the adoption of those measures and the importance of the oil sector for the Russian economy were also well known, the fact that the Council chose to adopt restrictive measures against the players in that industry can be readily understood in the light of the declared objective of those acts.</p>

          In addition, Rosneft has argued before the referring court that there was an infringement of its right of access to the file and of its rights of defence and right to effective judicial protection. In that regard, it is clear from the written observations lodged with the Court that Rosneft submitted, to the Council, requests for access to documents, seeking, in particular, access to the file in order to be able to state its case in the action before the General Court for annulment of the restrictive measures at issue in the main proceedings. According to Rosneft, the Council was under an obligation to grant it access to all non‑confidential official documents concerning those measures on the basis of, inter alia, Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents (

          ), since legislation must be of general application, its wording cannot be absolutely precise. It follows that, while the use of the legislative technique of referring to general categories, rather than to exhaustive lists, often leaves grey areas at the fringes of a definition, those doubts in relation to borderline cases are not sufficient, in themselves, to make a provision incompatible with Article 7 of that convention, provided that the provision proves to be sufficiently clear in the large majority of cases (see, to that effect, inter alia, ECtHR, 15 November 1996,
          <span class="italic">Cantoni v</span>

          Since those considerations are equally valid, under Article 52(3) of the Charter, with respect to Article 49 of the Charter, the Court must hold that the choice made by the European Union legislature to use, in the provisions referred to by Rosneft, expressions or terms such as ‘financial assistance’, ‘waters deeper than 150 metres’, ‘shale’, or ‘transferable securities’, cannot, in itself, constitute a breach of the principle of

          , ECLI:CE:ECHR:2014:0318JUD002406903, § 174 and the case‑law cited). In this case, the Court must hold that the terms which are claimed by Rosneft to be lacking in precision, while they are not absolutely precise, are not such that it is impossible for an individual to know for which acts and omissions he may be criminally liable.

          Rosneft and the German Government consider that, in using that expression, Regulation No 833/2014 refers not to acts which involve the mere processing of payments, but to acts of financing which provide active and substantive support. In that regard, the German Government argues, in particular, that payment services are services supplied to carry out payments on behalf of third party payers, as is apparent from the definition given in Article 4(3) of Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 13 November 2007 on payment services in the internal market, amending Directives 97/7/EC, 2002/65/EC, 2005/60/EC and 2006/48/EC and repealing Directive 97/5/EC (

          ), read together with the annex to that directive. By contrast, services the supply of which requires authorisation under Article 4(3) of Regulation No 833/2014, such as the provision of grants, loans and export credit insurance, are services which the bank concerned provides using its own funds to the benefit of a third party.
