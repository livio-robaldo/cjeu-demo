That tax liability is sufficient for eligibility for exemption from advance tax on investment income pursuant to Article 266 of the ITC 1992, Article 106(5) of the RD/ITC 1992 and Article 5 of Directive 90/435.

          Those requirements concerning the content of a request for a preliminary ruling are expressly set out in Article 94 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court, of which the national court should, in the context of the cooperation instituted by Article 267 TFEU, be aware and which it is bound to observe scrupulously (judgment of 10 November 2016, Private Equity Insurance Group,

          Thus, the court making the reference must set out the tenor of any national provisions applicable in the case and the precise reasons that led it to raise the question of the interpretation of certain provisions of EU law and to consider it necessary to refer questions to the Court for a preliminary ruling. The Court has previously held that it is essential that the national court should give, at the very least, some explanation of the reasons for the choice of the EU law provisions which it seeks to have interpreted and of the link it establishes between those provisions and the national legislation applicable to the proceedings pending before it (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 March 2016, Safe Interenvíos,
