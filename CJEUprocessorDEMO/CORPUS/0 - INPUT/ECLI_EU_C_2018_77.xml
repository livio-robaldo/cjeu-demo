          In the context of a ‘customs suspensive arrangement’, the customs authorities are responsible for monitoring tax warehouses and the departure of products from the duty suspension arrangement. They also see to it that export formalities are met, including the simplified export declaration, for the purposes of Articles 282 and 286 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code (

Thus the ‘simplified export procedure’ at issue does not affect the harmonisation measures provided for in that directive.

          Fourthly and finally, Article 17(1)(a)(iii) and Article 25 of Directive 2008/118 do not apply, since the petroleum products concerned in the present case leave the customs territory of the Union directly, and are not moved under a duty suspension arrangement. In accordance with Article 269(1) of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code (

          ), the supply of petroleum products is to take place under the export procedure provided for in that article. It is clear from that provision that ‘Union goods to be taken out of the customs territory of the Union shall be placed under the export procedure’.

          That distance would be easily accounted for by the remaining fuel in the fuel tanks of the vehicles before re-fuelling and it would thus be disproportionate to charge excise duty. In addition, as is apparent from paragraphs 25 to 33 of the judgment of 14 November 1985, Neumann (

          ), in the present case the application of the rules of Directive 2008/118 would be disproportionate by virtue of their general nature and if the Union legislator had legislated for this specific case, it would have done so on the basis of fairness.
