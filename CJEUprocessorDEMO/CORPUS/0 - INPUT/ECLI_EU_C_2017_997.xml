          As a preliminary point, it must be noted that, in accordance with Article 168(7) TFEU, as interpreted in the case-law of the Court, EU law does not detract from the power of the Member States to adopt provisions aimed at organising their health services. In exercising that power, however, the Member States must comply with EU law, in particular the provisions of TFEU on the freedom of establishment, which prohibit the Member States from introducing or maintaining unjustified restrictions of the exercise of that freedom in the health care sector (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 September 2017, Malta Dental Technologists Association and Reynaud,

          According to the settled case-law of the Court, all the provisions of the Treaty on freedom of movement for persons are intended to facilitate the pursuit by Union nationals of occupational activities of all kinds throughout the EU, and preclude measures that might place Union nationals at a disadvantage when they wish to pursue an activity in the territory of a Member State other than their Member State of origin. In that context, nationals of the Member States have in particular the right, which they derive directly from the Treaty, to leave their Member State of origin to enter the territory of another Member State and reside there in order to pursue an activity there. As a result, Article 45 TFEU precludes any national measure which is capable of hindering or rendering less attractive the exercise by Union nationals of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by that article (see, to that effect, judgment of 18 July 2017, Erzberger,

          It must be held that a Member State’s legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which makes the disbursement of a bursary intended to fund specialist doctor training given in another Member State conditional upon the recipient doctor practising in the Member State of training for a specific period after completion of his specialisation, is liable to deter that doctor from exercising his right to free movement or freedom of establishment, laid down in Articles 45 and 49 TFEU. Indeed, that doctor will be deterred from leaving his Member State of origin to work or establish himself in another Member State, if that leads him to repay up to 70% of the amount of the bursary received, together with interest (see, by analogy, judgment of 8 November 2012, Radziejewski,

          In that connection, it must be recalled that human health and life rank foremost among the assets and interests protected by the Treaty. Furthermore, not only may the risk of seriously compromising the financial equilibrium of a social security system constitute, per se, an overriding reason relating to the general interest capable of justifying an obstacle to the fundamental freedoms laid down by TFEU, but in addition the objective of maintaining, on grounds of public health, a balanced medical and hospital service open to all may also fall within one of the derogations on grounds of public health, in so far as it contributes to the attainment of a high level of health protection. This thus applies to measures that, on the one hand, meet the objective of guaranteeing in the territory of the Member State concerned sufficient and permanent access to a balanced range of high-quality medical treatment and, on the other, are intended to ensure cost efficiency and prevention, as far as possible, of any wastage of financial, technical and human resources (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 January 2016, CASTA and Others,

        <p class="normal">Secondly, as regards whether those provisions are appropriate, the referring court will have to take into account the fact that, as noted by the Advocate General in points 87 and 88 of his Opinion, the obligation, for specialist doctors having received funding for their training, to work in the Autonomous Province of Bolzano is restricted to 5 years within the first 10 years following qualification as a specialist, and arises, in accordance with the legislation at issue in the main proceedings, only in the situation in which a specialist doctor position is available in that province for the doctor in question and that position is offered to him at the right moment.</p>

Furthermore, Ms Simma Federspiel, by signing the declaration, had expressed her agreement to the obligation to repay the bursary received in the event of total failure to honour that undertaking.</p>
