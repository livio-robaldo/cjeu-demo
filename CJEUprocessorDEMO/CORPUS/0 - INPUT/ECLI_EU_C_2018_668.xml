          Therefore, unlike restrictive measures of individual application, it cannot be maintained that the restrictive measures of general application in question are likely to cause, as regards an individual operator, clear non-material harm resulting in damage to its reputation, comparable to that caused by the opprobrium and suspicion that accompany the public designation of the persons covered as being associated with, for example, a terrorist organisation (see, to that effect, judgment of 8 May 2013, Abdulrahim v Council and Commission,

          Moreover, as regards the effect that the restrictive measures set out in the regime at issue are likely to have on certain rights and freedoms which the banks and financial institutions concerned may enjoy, in so far as those measures may, inter alia, have had the effect of hindering the conclusion of a number of financial transactions, it should be noted, as the Court has held several times, that restrictive measures, by definition, have consequences which affect, inter alia, the right to property and the freedom to pursue a trade or business, thereby causing harm to persons who are in no way responsible for the situation which led to the adoption of the sanctions (see, to that effect, judgments of 30 July 1996, Bosphorus,

          Although it cannot definitively be excluded that, in the future, restrictive measures may be adopted again against the Islamic Republic of Iran, as Bank Mellat maintained, in such a case it would be a new situation giving rise, where appropriate, to restrictive measures taking the form either of measures comparable to those imposed by the regime at issue, or of measures of a different nature. However, even assuming the unlawfulness of the regime at issue, which has not been determined by the Court, the mere assumption of the repetition of such alleged unlawfulness by the adoption, in the future, of restrictive measures comparable to that regime is not sufficient to demonstrate, in view, inter alia, of the Council’s broad discretion in defining the subject of the restrictive measures (judgment of 28 March 2017, Rosneft,
