          ’ (central rate), establishing a trading exchange, setting a ‘

          In those proceedings, the Commission submitted observations before the Cour de Cassation (Court of Cassation) pursuant to Article 15(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules of competition laid down in Articles [101 and 102 TFEU] (
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=OJ:L:2003:001:TOC" hreflang="en" target="CourtTab">OJ 2003 L 1, p. 1</a>
          ). It explains that there are not only general derogations, adopted on the basis of Article 2 of Regulations Nos 26 and 1184/2006 and Article 176 of Regulation No 1234/2007, from the applicability of EU competition rules to the agricultural sector, but also, under Article 175 of Regulation No 1234/2007, specific derogations laid down in the various regulations on the common organisation of the markets, which impose on organisations active in the production of, and trade in, fruit and vegetables certain specific tasks which would normally be liable to be caught by the prohibitions laid down in the rules on competition. In the present case, according to the Commission, those are, for the period up to the end of 2007, Regulation No 2200/96 and, for the period from 1 January 2008, Regulation No 1182/2007, incorporated into Regulation No 1234/2007. The Commission considers, however, that the main conduct at issue in the main proceedings, namely the minimum price mechanisms agreed by the main APOs, does not form part of the specific tasks provided for by the common organisation of the market concerned and cannot be considered to be covered by those specific derogations.

        <p class="normal">As regards the objectives mentioned in paragraphs 42 and 61 above, it should be observed that the objectives of ensuring that production is planned and adjusted to demand, of concentrating supply and placing on the market the products produced by members, and of stabilising producer prices, necessarily entail the exchange of strategic information between individual producers that are members of the PO or APO concerned, the purpose of which is, inter alia, to acquire knowledge of the characteristics of the products produced by the members. Therefore, exchanges of strategic information between producers within the same PO or APO are liable to be proportionate if they are in fact made for the purposes of one or more of the objectives assigned to that PO or APO and are limited only to the information that is strictly necessary for those purposes.</p>

        <p class="normal">In addition, the objective of concentrating supply to strengthen the position of producers in the face of ever greater concentration of demand may also justify a certain form of coordination of the pricing policy of individual agricultural producers within a PO or an APO. That applies in particular where the PO or APO concerned has been assigned by its members the responsibility for marketing all their products, as required, save in special cases, by Article 125a(1)(c) of Regulation No 1234/2007, read in conjunction with Article 125c thereof.</p>
