          Since the defendants in the main proceedings have raised a plea of
          <span class="italic">lis pendens</span>
          based on Article 27 of Regulation No 44/2001, the referring court is uncertain whether, having regard to the provisions of Article 30 of that regulation, as not being the court first seised, it is required to stay its proceedings until such time as the international jurisdiction of the Tribunal de commerce de Toulon (Commercial Court, Toulon), which is the court first seised, has been established or whether it may proceed to examine the substance of the action in the main proceedings as the court first seised. In that regard, it considers that its decision depends on whether the act which commenced the proceedings for the taking of evidence before the Tribunal de commerce de Marseille (Commercial Court, Marseilles) constitutes a ‘document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document’ within the meaning of point 1 of Article 30 of Regulation No 44/2001, or whether that classification belongs to the document by which the action before the Tribunal de commerce de Toulon (Commercial Court, Toulon) was brought.

In consequence, the request for a preliminary ruling, which concerns legal proceedings brought by HanseYachts on 21 November 2014, must be examined in the light of Regulation No 44/2001.

          Having regard to that independence and the very clear distinction between the proceedings for the taking of evidence, on the one hand, and any substantive procedure, on the other, the concept of an ‘equivalent document’ to a document instituting legal proceedings, set out in Article 30 of Regulation No 44/2001, must be interpreted as meaning that a document instituting proceedings for the taking of evidence cannot be regarded, for the purposes of assessing a situation of
          <span class="italic">lis pendens</span>
          and of determining which court is the court first seised within the meaning of Article 27(1) of that regulation, as also being the document instituting the substantive proceedings. Moreover, such an interpretation would be incompatible with the objective pursued by point 1 of Article 30 thereof, which, as set out in Paragraph 30 of this judgment, seeks to permit the simple and uniform identification of the time at which a court is seised.

          In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the question referred is that Article 27(1) and point 1 of Article 30 of Regulation No 44/2001 must be interpreted as meaning, in cases of
          <span class="italic">lis pendens</span>
          , that the date on which a procedure for a measure of inquiry prior to any legal proceedings was commenced cannot constitute the date on which, within the meaning of point 1 of Article 30 of that regulation, a court called upon to rule on a substantive application which was brought in the same Member State following the result of that measure was ‘deemed to be seised’.
