It also pointed out that the information featuring on the Carrefour website did not make it clear to consumers that the comparison was being made between shops of different sizes.</p>

          Furthermore, according to settled case-law of the Court, since comparative advertising contributes to demonstrating, in an objective manner, the advantages of various comparable goods and thus to stimulating competition between suppliers of goods and services to the consumer’s advantage, the conditions to be met for such advertising must be interpreted in the sense most favourable to that advertising, while ensuring at the same time that comparative advertising is not used anticompetitively and unfairly or in a manner which affects adversely the interests of consumers (see, to that effect, judgments of 25 October 2001, Toshiba Europe,

Consequently, that information, in the context of such advertising comparing the prices charged in shops forming part of retail chains each possessing a range of shops of different sizes and formats, is necessary to enable the consumer to take an informed decision to buy the products concerned in the advertiser’s shops rather than in competitors’ shops and not to take a decision to purchase which he would not otherwise have taken.
