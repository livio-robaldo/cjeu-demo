        <p class="normal">… passing from one Member State to another while in possession of a weapon should, in principle, be prohibited; … a derogation therefrom is acceptable only if a procedure is adopted that enables Member States to be notified that a firearm is to be brought into their territory;</p>

By virtue of Article 29 of the 1972 Act of Accession, read in conjunction with point 4 of Section I of Annex I thereto, Gibraltar is excluded from the customs territory of the European Union and the Court has already stated in this connection that the application of directives which have Article 114 or Article 115 TFEU as their legal basis and the free movement of goods as their principal objective is excluded on the territory of Gibraltar.</p>

That is so in the case of the provisions of Directive 91/477 relating to the pass which are intended to benefit hunters and sports target shooters, as such a document is issued for the exclusive purpose of travel to and from Member States, in order to enable those persons to participate in sporting events. Issue of the pass is unrelated to commercial transactions in respect of the goods that it concerns, namely firearms.</p>

On that ground, those provisions are applicable on the territory of Gibraltar, which means that the competent authorities are obliged to transpose them in a national legal measure applicable on that territory. The failure to transpose them results in discrimination against hunters and sports target shooters resident in Gibraltar, who have to incur extra expenditure and administrative delays when travelling in the European Union with their firearms in order to take part in hunting or target shooting events and competitions, which amounts to an infringement of Article 56 TFEU. The firearms used in such a context cannot be viewed as goods involved in trade, but must be regarded as sporting equipment necessary for the purpose of such events or competitions.</p>

        <p class="normal">Finally, Mr Buhagiar and Others contend that the provisions of Directive 91/477 relating to the pass concern the free movement of persons, as its seventh recital confirms. To that extent, Directive 91/477, since it was adopted on the basis of Article 100a(1) of the EEC Treaty, is founded on an incorrect legal basis. In accordance with Article 100a(2) of the EEC Treaty, the content of which corresponds, in essence, to that of Article 95(2) EC and that of Article 114(2) TFEU, the legislative procedure referred to in paragraph 1 of each of those articles cannot be followed for the adoption of EU acts relating to the free movement of persons.

          The Court has explained in that regard that it is true that failure to apply such directives on the territory of Gibraltar is liable to endanger the coherence of other EU policies when those directives also pursue, albeit as an ancillary aim, objectives connected with those other policies, such as environmental protection policy. Nevertheless, the existence of such a risk cannot lead to the extension of the territorial scope of those directives — which pursue, as their main aim, objectives connected with the free movement of goods — beyond the limits imposed by the Treaties and by the 1972 Act of Accession (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 September 2003, Commission v United Kingdom,

          As regards, in the second place, the question whether Article 12(2) of Directive 91/477, read in conjunction with Article 1(4) thereof and Annex II thereto, is applicable to Gibraltar on the ground that, although it concerns the free movement of goods, it relates neither to trade nor to commercial transactions concerning firearms, the referring court certainly agrees with the premiss that the exclusion of Gibraltar laid down in Article 29 of the 1972 Act of Accession, read in conjunction with point 4 of Section I of Annex I thereto, implies, in principle, that EU acts whose main aim is to ensure, as regards the free movement of goods, approximation of the provisions of the Member States do not apply on the territory of Gibraltar, in accordance with the case-law resulting from the judgment of 23 September 2003, Commission v United Kingdom (

          Nevertheless, in the case which gave rise to that judgment the Court was not called upon to rule on the status of EU acts falling within the free movement of goods in the light of that exception, in contrast to the case which gave rise to the judgment of 23 September 2003, Commission v United Kingdom (

          In that respect, it is to be noted that, under Article 28(1) TFEU, which is in Title II, relating to the free movement of goods, of Part Three of the FEU Treaty, the customs union is to cover all trade in goods.

          The Court has consistently held that ‘goods’ for the purposes of that provision means goods which can be valued in money and which are capable, as such, of forming the subject of commercial transactions. However, the provisions of the FEU Treaty on the free movement of goods apply, in principle, irrespective of whether the goods concerned are being transported across borders for the purposes of sale or resale, or rather for personal use or consumption (see, to that effect, judgments of 7 March 1989, Schumacher,
