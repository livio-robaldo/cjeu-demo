According to the Commission, those considerations in themselves are sufficient to reject the argument that the General Court should have criticised the Commission for having adopted the decision at issue without having sent a new statement of objections to the undertakings.</p>

The General Court was therefore correct to take the view, in paragraphs 133 and 134 of the judgments under appeal, that where, following the annulment of a decision, the Commission chooses to rectify the illegalities found in the latter and to adopt an identical decision which is not vitiated by those illegalities, that decision relates to the same objections as those in respect of which the undertakings had already submitted observations, such that the Commission was not obligated to give the undertakings in question the opportunity to be heard in respect of the legal basis used to impose on them the fines adopted by the decision at issue.</p>

Similarly, the presence of those representatives during the hearing of 30 September 2002, following the notification of the supplementary statement of objections, was consistent with the procedural rules of the EC Treaty, which had become applicable.</p>

Therefore, given that, as is clear from paragraph 36 of the present judgment, the statement of objections and the supplementary statement of objections were not affected by the annulment of the 2002 decision, it is necessary to assess whether the Commission gave the parties the opportunity to develop their arguments at an oral hearing conducted in accordance with the procedural requirements of Regulations No 1/2003 and 773/2004, in particular those referred to in Article 14 of the latter regulation, as it was required to do.</p>

This is clear, first, from that statement, which expressly invited its addressees to make known their point of view on those supplementary objections. Second, the Commission stated, in paragraph 382 of the decision at issue, that it did not consider it necessary to repeat the oral hearing of 13 June 2002, in application of the provisions of Regulations No 17 and 1/2003, since that hearing, in which the Member State representatives did not participate, had been conducted in conformity with the rules of the ECSC Treaty, which was applicable at the time.

The appellants also ask the Court to declare a breach of the second paragraph of Article 47 of the Charter, and that it constitutes a sufficiently serious breach of a rule of law intended to confer rights on individuals.

          The Commission’s plea of inadmissibility must be rejected. As the Court has already had occasion to note, as regards a failure by the General Court to adjudicate within a reasonable time, an appellant which considers that such a failure before the General Court prejudices its interests is not required to assert that prejudice immediately. Where appropriate, it may wait until the end of proceedings in order to ascertain the total duration of the prejudice and therefore to have all the information necessary to identify that which it has, in its view, sustained (judgment of 26 November 2013, Gascogne Sack Deutschland v Commission,

          ). It follows that the claims made by the appellants during the proceedings before the General Court concerning the duration of those proceedings cannot prevent them from raising the unreasonableness of that duration at the end of those proceedings.

          In respect of the appellants’ request to the Court to set aside the judgments under appeal, to reduce the fine on account of the allegedly excessive duration of that procedure, or to declare a breach of the second paragraph of Article 47 of the Charter, it should be recalled that a breach, by a Court of the European Union, of its obligation under that provision to adjudicate on the cases before it within a reasonable time must be sanctioned in an action for damages brought before the General Court, since such an action constitutes an effective remedy. Accordingly, a claim for compensation for the damage caused by the failure on the part of the General Court to adjudicate within a reasonable time may not be made directly to the Court of Justice in the context of an appeal, but must be brought before the General Court itself. The General Court, which has jurisdiction under Article 256(1) TFEU, hearing a claim for damages, is required to rule on such a claim sitting in a different composition from that which heard the dispute which gave rise to the procedure whose duration is criticised (judgment of 9 June 2016, Repsol Lubricantes y Especialidades and Others v Commission,
