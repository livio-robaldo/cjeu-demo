In its view, such transfer did not therefore correspond to the objective fixed by Regulation No 1257/1999. The Council of Ministers contends that one of the aims pursued by Decree No 187 is to prevent Latvian law from being incompatible with the conditions stemming from Regulation No 1257/1999 and with the principle of the useful and efficient employment of the finances of the European Union and the Member States.</p>

That provision may not therefore be interpreted as giving rise to an unrestricted right to the payment of early retirement support for a period of 15 years. It not only emphasises the temporary nature of that support, but also implies a fortiori that the death of the transferor of a farm brings its payment to an end.</p>

          Next, the Court has concluded from the existence of those various objectives that the EU legislature intended to encourage early retirement in the farming sector in order to improve the viability of agricultural holdings and to create an economic incentive to older farmers to cease their activities early, and in circumstances in which they would not ordinarily do so, the supplement to the retirement pension or additional income being only one of the consequences of the application of Regulation No 1257/1999 (see, to that effect, judgment of 7 July 2016, Poland v Commission,
