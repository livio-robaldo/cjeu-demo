On the other hand, the activity carried out by NTN was not an activity pertaining to public authorities, but rather an economic activity, that company merely contributing to the performance of municipal tasks rather than carrying them out directly. In that context, the Office also noted that it was relevant that NTN supplied services not only to the Municipality of Nagyszénás, but also to other persons, and that NTN had exercised its right to deduct VAT in that regard.</p>

          In that regard, it should be noted that the possibility of classifying a supply of services as a ‘transaction for consideration’, which, as a general rule, is subject to VAT under Article 2(1)(c) of Directive 2006/112, requires only that there be a direct link between that supply and the consideration actually received by the taxable person. Such a direct link is established if there is a legal relationship between the provider of the service and the recipient pursuant to which there is reciprocal performance, the payment received by the provider of the service constituting the value actually given in return for the service supplied to the recipient (judgments of 29 October 2015, Saudaçor,

          Furthermore, in determining whether the activity at issue in the main proceedings is effected ‘for consideration’, the fact that performance of the public tasks constitutes a legal obligation imposed on the Municipality of Nagyszénás is not capable of calling into question the classification of such an activity as a ‘supply of services’ or the direct link between the service provided and the consideration given in exchange (see, by analogy, judgment of 2 June 2016, Lajvér,

          The fact that the activity at issue consists in the performance of duties conferred and regulated by law in the public interest is irrelevant for the purposes of determining whether that activity can be classified as a supply of services effected for consideration. In that context, the Court has held that, even when the object of the activity in question is to fulfil a constitutional obligation exclusively and directly incumbent upon the Member State concerned, the direct link between the supply of services and the consideration received cannot be called into question by that fact alone (see, inter alia, judgment of 2 June 2016, Lajvér,

          Moreover, although the public interest objective of certain services provided by, in particular, bodies governed by public law is taken into account in the common system of VAT, in so far as certain services are exempt from VAT under Article 132(1) of Directive 2006/112, it is common ground that the activity for which NTN is responsible under the contract at issue does not fall within any of those exceptions (see, by analogy, judgment of 29 October 2015, Saudaçor,

          According to the settled case-law of the Court, it is clear from analysis of Article 13(1) of Directive 2006/112 made in the light of the aims of the directive that two conditions must be fulfilled cumulatively for the rule of treatment as a non-taxable person laid down by that provision to apply: the activities must be carried out by a body governed by public law and they must be carried out by that body acting as a public authority (judgment of 29 October 2015, Saudaçor,

          As regards the first of those two conditions, namely, the condition that the body be governed by public law, the Court has held that, if the fact that, under the applicable national law, the body in question has powers conferred by public law is not decisive for the purposes of that classification, it does constitute, in so far as it is an essential characteristic specific to any public authority, a factor of definite importance in determining that the body must be classified as a ‘body governed by public law’ (judgment of 29 October 2015, Saudaçor,
