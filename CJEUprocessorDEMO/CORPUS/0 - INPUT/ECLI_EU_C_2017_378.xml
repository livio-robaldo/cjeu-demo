          Secondly, that court states that, having regard to the fact that the taxable event in relation to the additional contribution is the payment of dividends, that its basis of assessment comprises the amount of the dividends paid, that the taxpayer is the company which distributes the dividends and that there is no tax credit in favour of the shareholder, that additional contribution does not appear, in the light of the criteria set out by the Court in its judgment of 26 June 2008, Burda (
