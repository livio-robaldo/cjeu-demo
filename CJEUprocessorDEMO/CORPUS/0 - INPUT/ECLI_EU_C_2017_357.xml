          It must be borne in mind that, in an appeal, the Court of Justice has no jurisdiction to establish the facts or, in principle, to examine the evidence which the General Court accepted in support of those facts. Provided that the evidence has been properly obtained and the general principles of law and the rules of procedure in relation to the burden of proof and the taking of evidence have been observed, it is for the General Court alone to assess the value which should be attached to the evidence produced to it. Save where the evidence adduced before the General Court has been distorted, that assessment therefore does not constitute a point of law which is subject to review by the Court of Justice (judgment of 18 January 2017, Toshiba v Commission,

More particularly, the General Court could not state that for a method of measurement to be reproducible ‘circular’ tests had to be performed, without explaining why the contrary arguments put forward by Dyson in its pleadings were not capable of disproving that statement. While the Commission did indeed contest the reproducibility of the Cenelec method before the General Court, it is clear that Dyson argued to the contrary in its pleadings, so that it was for the General Court to rule on the point. By failing to reply to the arguments thus put forward by Dyson, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons under the first paragraph of Article 53 of the Statute of the Court of Justice and Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court.</p>

          So, while, as the General Court correctly observed in paragraph 38 of the judgment under appeal, in the exercise of the powers conferred on them the EU authorities have broad discretion in particular where they are called on to undertake complex assessments and evaluations, it must first be determined whether they are indeed acting within the limits of the powers given to them and, more particularly, in a case such as the present one concerning a delegated power under Article 290 TFEU, it must be ascertained whether the EU authorities have exceeded the powers conferred on them by the enabling act, bearing in mind in particular that such a delegated power must in any event comply with the essential elements of the enabling act and come within the regulatory framework as defined by the basic legislative act (see, to that effect, judgment of 17 March 2016, Parliament v Commission,

Similarly, Article 1(1) of the directive provides that its aim is to harmonise national measures on information for end users on energy consumption ‘during use’, so that they can choose ‘more efficient’ products. Information for consumers on the energy efficiency of products during use is therefore the essential objective of the directive, and reflects a political choice falling within the responsibilities of the EU legislature.</p>
