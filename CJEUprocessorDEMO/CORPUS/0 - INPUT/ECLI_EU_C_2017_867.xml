          The Court has held, in that regard, that holding an invoice showing the details referred to in Article 226 of the VAT Directive is a formal condition of the right to deduct VAT. The deduction of input VAT must be allowed if the substantive requirements are satisfied, even if the taxable persons have failed to comply with certain formal conditions (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 September 2016, Senatex,

The identification of the issuer of the invoice allows the tax authorities to check whether the amount of VAT giving rise to the deduction has been declared and paid.

Even though the national court had found that the building designated in the commercial register as being the trader’s seat was in a dilapidated state, the Court held that the fact that no economic activity could be carried out at that company’s seat does not mean that that activity could not be conducted in places other than the company’s seat (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 October 2015, PPUH Stehcemp,
