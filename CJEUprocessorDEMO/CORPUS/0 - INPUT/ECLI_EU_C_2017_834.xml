          According to that court, procedural reasons also justify the concomitant application of Paragraph 315 of the BGB and the German railway legislation. A claim under that Paragraph for a fair charge to be set by a court can be made by a rail transport undertaking without any particular conditions. Such an action would necessarily entail a review of the charge set by the infrastructure manager and, if necessary, a reduction in its amount after an assessment of its fairness, with

It follows from that provision that the decisions of the regulatory body, if necessary subject to review by the courts, have legal effects for all parties involved in the railway sector, whether they are transport undertakings or infrastructure managers. It would run counter to that principle for judgments delivered by the civil courts, if necessary on the basis of criteria set by the legislation concerning the calculation of charges, to have effects only on the parties to the disputes brought before those courts.</p>

The civil court seised, unlike the regulatory body, is unable to extend the dispute to other contracts for use of the infrastructure or to deliver a judgment which would apply to the entire sector concerned.</p>

The reasoning on which the application of Paragraph 315 of the BGB rests, according to which it has ‘autonomous scope’ parallel to the scope of the legislation concerning the access to the railway infrastructure, should lead to the conclusion that the specific objectives referred to in the provisions of that legislation are not taken into consideration.</p>
