In the referring court’s view, the contract is made up of a number of operations which constitute a sequence of commercial transactions. It is true that the Law of 8 March 2013 limits commercial transactions to contracts. However, uncertainty remains as to whether the EU legislature protects a legal act such as a contract or whether it also safeguards a commercial operation carried out by an economic operator, such as a payment made in return for the provision of goods or services.</p>

Thus, several commercial transactions could be carried out under a single framework contract. In addition, the creditor’s right to obtain prompt payment in a commercial transaction pleads in favour of that protection not being limited to contracts, but extended to commercial operations.</p>

          It must be observed that, according to settled case-law, the need for a uniform application of EU law and the principle of equality require that the terms of a provision of EU law which makes no express reference to the law of the Member States for the purpose of determining its meaning and scope must normally be given an independent and uniform interpretation throughout the European Union (judgment of 18 October 2016, Nikiforidis,

          As Article 12(4) of Directive 2011/7 makes no express reference to the law of the Member States, it should therefore be interpreted autonomously and uniformly.
