          It that regard, it must be recalled that, in accordance with Article 120(c) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice and the case-law relating to that provision, an application initiating proceedings in respect of direct actions must state the subject matter of the proceedings and set out a summary of the pleas in law on which the application is based; that statement must be sufficiently clear and precise to enable the defendant to prepare his defence and the Court to rule on the application. It follows that the essential points of law and of fact on which such an action is based must be indicated coherently and intelligibly in the application itself (judgment of 2 June 2016, Commission v Netherlands,

Article 6(1) of Regulation No 1370/2007 read in conjunction with point 5 of the annex to that regulation requires, for its part, an accounting separation between the public transport activities between contracts that give rise to the payment of compensation for public service obligations and those that do not.</p>
