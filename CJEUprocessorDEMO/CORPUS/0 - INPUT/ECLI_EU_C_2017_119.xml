          X brought proceedings against those additional assessments before the Rechtbank te Breda (District Court, Breda, the Netherlands). By decision of 12 September 2012, that court found that the additional assessments covering the years up to and including 2004, imposed pursuant to the extended recovery period under Article 16(4) of the AWR, had not been effected with the diligence required by the judgment of 11 June 2009, X and Passenheim-van Schoot (

          ). Nevertheless, that court held, on the basis of the standstill clause in Article 64(1) TFEU, that the free movement of capital, and accordingly the case-law resulting from that judgment, was not applicable to the additional assessment in so far as the recovery related to the Swiss bank account. On those grounds, it upheld the additional assessments for the years up to and including 2003 — apart from a correction in relation to the distribution of income between X and his spouse — and reduced the additional assessment for 2004 by the amount of tax relating to the Luxembourg bank account.

Meanwhile, X lodged a cross-appeal against that decision before the Gerechtshof te ’s‑Hertogenbosch (Regional Court of Appeal, ’s‑Hertogenbosch) in so far as the decision related to the additional assessments for all of the years in dispute before the Rechtbank te Breda (District Court, Breda) and, in that context, challenged the contention that the standstill clause in Article 64(1) TFEU implied that the free movement of capital was not applicable in as much as the recovery related to his Swiss bank account.</p>

          The Gerechtshof te ’s‑Hertogenbosch (Regional Court of Appeal, ’s‑Hertogenbosch) dismissed the main appeal lodged by the tax inspector as unfounded. As regards the cross-appeal brought by X, that court deemed it to be inadmissible in so far as it concerned the additional assessments for the years up to and including 2003 as well as for the years 2005 and 2006, but held that it was well founded in so far as it related to the additional assessment for 2004. In that regard, that court took the view that the recovery in respect of the Swiss bank account came fully within the scope of the case-law resulting from the judgment of 11 June 2009, X and Passenheim-van Schoot (

          ). It took the view that Article 64(1) TFEU was not applicable to the main proceedings since the measure referred to in Article 16(4) of the AWR is a general measure that can be applied in situations that have nothing to do with direct investment, the provision of financial services or the admission of securities to capital markets, which are the categories expressly mentioned in Article 64(1) TFEU.

          The Hoge Raad der Nederlanden (Supreme Court of the Netherlands) expresses doubt, in the first place, as to whether the scope
          <span class="italic">ratione materiae</span>
          of Article 64(1) TFEU is delineated by the purpose of the corresponding national legislation or by the transaction restricted by that national legislation. In that regard, it notes, on the one hand, that the reference to the ‘application’ of restrictions set out in Article 64(1) TFEU appears to be an argument in favour of the latter interpretation. In addition, it takes the view that the first interpretation could have the consequence of divesting that provision of much of its practical effect. On the other hand, it observes that an argument in favour of the former interpretation might be found in the judgment of 14 December 1995, Sanz de Lera and Others (
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1995%3A451&amp;locale=en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch" hreflang="en" class="CourtLink">C‑163/94, C‑165/94 and C‑250/94</a>

          ). It states that, in that judgment, the Court held that Article 73c(1) of the EC Treaty (now Article 64(1) TFEU) does not cover rules that apply generally to all exports of coins, banknotes or bearer cheques, including those which do not involve, in third countries, direct investment, establishment, the provision of financial services or the admission of securities to capital markets.

          In the second place, the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden (Supreme Court of the Netherlands) expresses doubt as to whether Article 64(1) TFEU must be interpreted as covering only national law which applies to financial service providers and determines the conditions or mechanisms of the provision of services. In that regard, it notes, on the one hand, that, in the case which was pending on the date of the order for reference and subsequently gave rise to the judgment of 21 May 2015, Wagner-Raith (
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2015%3A347&amp;locale=en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch" hreflang="en" class="CourtLink">C‑560/13</a>

          ), the referring court and the Commission had both advocated such an interpretation. On the other hand, it observes that it could be argued that the wording of Article 64(1) TFEU contains nothing to support that interpretation and that the actual meaning of Article 64(1) TFEU would thereby be greatly restricted.

          In the third place, and lastly, the Hoge Raad der Nederlanden (Supreme Court of the Netherlands) expresses doubt as to whether the phrase ‘restrictions … in respect of the movement of capital to or from third countries involving … the provision of financial services’ in Article 64(1) TFEU covers the application of Article 16(4) of the AWR in connection with the bank account held by X with a bank in Switzerland. In that regard, it observes that, although it may be possible to categorise the holding of a securities account as a financial service in the light of the judgment of 11 June 2009, X and Passenheim-van Schoot (
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2009%3A368&amp;locale=en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch" hreflang="en" class="CourtLink">C‑155/08 and C‑157/08</a>

          ), that judgment concerns the interpretation of Article 49 EC and Article 56 EC (now Article 56 TFEU and Article 63 TFEU) and it is doubtful whether Article 64(1) TFEU has to be interpreted in the same way.

Thus, the applicability of Article 64(1) TFEU depends, not on the purpose of the national legislation containing such restrictions, but on its effect. That provision applies to the extent to which that national legislation imposes a restriction on movements of capital involving direct investment, establishment, the provision of financial services or the admission of securities to capital markets.

          Secondly, that interpretation is confirmed by the Court’s case-law. According to that case-law, a restriction on capital movements, such as a less favourable tax treatment of foreign-sourced dividends, comes within the scope of Article 64(1) TFEU, inasmuch as it relates to holdings acquired with a view to establishing or maintaining lasting and direct economic links between the shareholder and the company concerned and which allow the shareholder to participate effectively in the management of the company or in its control (judgment of 24 November 2016, SECIL,

          and the case-law cited). Similarly, according to the Court, a restriction is covered by Article 64(1) TFEU as being a restriction on the movement of capital involving direct investment in so far as it relates to investments of any kind undertaken by natural or legal persons and which serve to establish or maintain lasting and direct links between the persons providing the capital and the undertakings to which that capital is made available in order to carry out an economic activity (see, to that effect, judgment of 20 May 2008, Orange European Smallcap Fund,
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A2008%3A289&amp;locale=en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch" hreflang="en" class="CourtLink">C‑194/06</a>

          ). It is clear from those judgments, and, in particular, from their use of the phrases ‘inasmuch as’ and ‘in so far as’, that the scope of Article 64(1) TFEU does not depend on the specific purpose of a national restriction, but on its effect on the movements of capital referred to in that provision.

          That interpretation of Article 64(1) TFEU is not called into question by the judgment of 14 December 1995, Sanz de Lera and Others (

          ), cited by the referring court. It is true that, having stated, in paragraph 33 of that judgment, that the physical export of means of payment cannot itself be regarded as a capital movement, the Court held in paragraphs 35 and 36 of that judgment that national legislation which applies generally to all exports of coins, banknotes or bearer cheques, including those which do not involve, in non-member countries, direct investment (including in real estate), establishment, the provision of financial services or the admission of securities to capital markets do not come within the scope of Article 73c(1) of the EC Treaty (now Article 64(1) TFEU). However, in paragraph 37 of that judgment, the Court held that Member States are entitled to verify the nature and reality of the transactions and transfers in question, with a view to satisfying themselves that such transfers will not be used for the purposes of the capital movements which are specifically covered by the restrictions authorised by Article 73c(1) of the EC Treaty. It follows from the judgment of 14 December 1995, Sanz de Lera and Others (
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1995%3A451&amp;locale=en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch" hreflang="en" class="CourtLink">C‑163/94, C‑165/94 and C‑250/94</a>

          ), that Member States can rely on Article 64(1) TFEU in so far as the national rules apply to the movements of capital referred to in that provision.

          In that regard, it should first be pointed out that, in the absence of a definition of ‘movement of capital’ in the TFEU, the Court has recognised the nomenclature that constitutes Annex I to Directive 88/361 as having indicative value, it being understood that, as pointed out in the introduction to that annex, the list which it contains is not exhaustive (judgment of 21 May 2015, Wagner-Raith,

          and the case-law cited). Nevertheless, as the Commission observed in its observations submitted to the Court, that annex makes reference, under Heading VI, to ‘operations in current and deposit accounts with financial institutions’, which include ‘operations carried out by residents with foreign financial institutions’. Accordingly, the opening of a securities account with a banking institution, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, comes within the concept of ‘movement of capital’.

          Consequently, the fact that a national measure concerns first and foremost the investor and not the provider of a financial service cannot preclude that measure from coming within the scope of Article 64(1) TFEU (judgment of 21 May 2015, Wagner-Raith,
