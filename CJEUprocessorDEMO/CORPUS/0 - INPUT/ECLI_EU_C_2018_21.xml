Under that administrative practice, a vehicle in respect of which an application to pay the proportionate registration tax has been made may not be used in Denmark while that application is being processed by the tax authorities, unless the full amount of registration tax has been paid beforehand, in which case the surplus paid by the taxpayer, plus interest, will be repaid to the taxpayer if and when those authorities authorise the payment of the proportionate registration tax.</p>

          ), that the obligation imposed on persons resident or established in a Member State who rent or lease a vehicle in another Member State, even for a limited period that is known in advance, to pay an amount of tax identical to that applicable where the vehicle is imported permanently is liable to render the rental or leasing of vehicles from a company established in another Member State more onerous than when the rental or leasing contract is entered into with a company established in the first Member State, in the light, in particular, of the discriminatory nature of such an obligation with respect to amortisation of the tax, to the detriment of rental or leasing undertakings established in another Member State. In the case that gave rise to that judgment, the national legislation requiring payment of the full amount of registration tax applied equally to residents of the Member State who rented or leased a vehicle from a company established in its territory.

          Making immediate use of a vehicle leased by the residents of one Member State from a leasing company established in another Member State subject to advance payment of the full amount of registration tax is, therefore, liable to deter both residents of the first Member State from calling on vehicle leasing services offered by service providers established in other Member States and those service providers from offering vehicle rental or leasing services to those residents.

          As regards, more specifically, vehicle registration taxes, it is settled case-law of the Court that a Member State may levy a registration tax on a vehicle made available to a person residing in that State by a company established in another Member State when that vehicle is intended to be used essentially in the first Member State on a permanent basis or is in fact used in that way (judgment of 19 September 2017, Commission v Ireland (

          The Danish Government submits in that regard that Paragraph 3b of the Law on Registration Tax for Motor Vehicles on the proportionate registration tax departs from the general rules which require, as part of that Member State’s powers of taxation in this area, payment of the full amount of registration tax before a vehicle is used in Danish territory. The purpose of the prior approval scheme is to enable the tax authorities to ensure, before the vehicle is used, that the conditions for payment of the proportionate registration tax are met and, therefore, to ensure compliance with the Danish State’s powers of taxation. The system is also aimed at preventing residents from concluding artificial leasing contracts for vehicles that are actually intended for long-term use in Denmark and/or actually are theirs, thereby avoiding payment of the full amount of registration tax. The Danish Government observes in that regard that the verification of duration of use and actual leasing arrangement, which are points covered in the examination procedure for prior approval, is inherent in the principle of payment of a tax, such as the proportionate registration tax, the amount of which is calculated proportionately to that duration (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 March 2002, Cura Anlagen,

The Danish Government states that the objective pursued by the authorisation scheme, as set out in the preceding paragraph, would be undermined if the leased vehicle could be used in Denmark simply upon payment of the proportionate registration tax, before the outcome of the procedure aimed at ascertaining compliance with the conditions laid down in the national legislation for payment of that tax, and payment of the full amount of registration tax on that vehicle would thus be avoided.</p>

          It should be noted that a prior approval scheme, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, may be held to be suitable for ensuring attainment of the objective referred to in the preceding paragraph. In the present case, in the course of the administrative procedure leading, where successful, to prior approval, the tax authorities verify whether the conditions of application of the proportionate tax are met, including the duration of the leasing contract and the identity of the actual owner of the vehicle in question. That check enables the amount of the tax to be calculated according to the duration of the lease in question and, therefore, the planned period of use of the vehicle in Danish territory. In that regard, the Court’s case-law is to the effect that, in order to be consistent with the principle of proportionality, the national legislation laying down the detailed rules for calculating such a tax must take into account the period of use of a vehicle leased from a company established in another Member State in the territory of the Member State in question (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 September 2017, Commission v Ireland (

As part of such a measure, the Member State in question may also limit the validity of the registration to the duration of the leasing contract. Such measures comprising, where necessary, in proven cases of circumvention of the tax rules or abuse, an obligation for the resident of Denmark, alone or, as the case may be, jointly and severally with the relevant leasing company, to pay the difference between the proportionate registration tax registration and the full amount of the registration tax, and also appropriate criminal sanctions, give the Member State in question the means to prevent and combat the risk referred to in paragraph 46 of this judgment.</p>
