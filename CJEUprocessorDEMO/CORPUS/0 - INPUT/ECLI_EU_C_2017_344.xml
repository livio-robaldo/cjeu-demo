          Article 132 of Directive 2006/112 provides for exemptions which, as indicated by the title of the chapter in which that provision is contained, are intended to encourage certain activities in the public interest. However, those exemptions do not cover every activity performed in the public interest, but only those listed in that provision and described in great detail (judgment of 25 February 2016, Commission v Netherlands,

          The terms used to specify those exemptions are to be interpreted strictly, since they constitute exceptions to the general principle, arising from Article 2 of Directive 2006/112, that VAT is to be levied on all services supplied for consideration by a taxable person. However, that requirement of strict interpretation does not mean that the terms used to specify the exemptions referred to in Article 132 should be construed in such a way as to deprive them of their intended effect (judgment of 25 February 2016, Commission v Netherlands,

          The term ‘closely related’, contained in Article 132(1)(i) of Directive 2006/112, is not defined therein. Nevertheless, it is clear from the wording of that provision that it relates to the supply of services which are closely linked to ‘children’s or young people’s education, school or university education, vocational training or retraining’. Thus, a supply of services can be regarded as ‘closely related’ to those latter services only where they are actually supplied as services ancillary to the education provided by the relevant establishment, which constitutes the principal supply (see, to that effect, judgments of 14 June 2007, Horizon College,
