On that basis, the European Union has sole competence to negotiate and conclude international agreements concerning intellectual property where it is established, having regard to their aim and content, that they display a specific link with international trade, for example, by facilitating international trade by means of the uniformisation of rules. Consequently, that exclusive competence, far from being restricted to agreements relating to the harmonisation of the protection of intellectual property rights which are negotiated in the context of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), extends, in particular, to other agreements which, when assessed individually, clearly have the principal objective of facilitating, on a reciprocal basis, trade in goods or services with third countries by affording such goods or services a similar degree of protection to that which they already enjoy within the internal market.</p>

        <p class="normal">Next, the Commission and the Parliament contend that, in the present case, the draft revised agreement, like the Lisbon Agreement, displays a specific link with international trade. It is true that the draft has no preamble expressly stating its aim. However, it is clear from an analysis of its provisions and its context that it has the aim and effect of providing, for the appellations of origin and geographical indications of each contracting party, a system of international registration which ensures their legal protection, on the territory of all the contracting parties, against the risk that they might be used in such a way as to undermine their integrity or their reputation and thus that the marketing abroad of the corresponding products might be prejudiced. In so doing, the draft revised agreement improves the protection of exports of those products from the European Union to third countries, protection which would otherwise depend on country-by-country registration and thus on variable legal guarantees. Consequently, a draft of that nature falls within the exclusive competence of the European Union in the field of the common commercial policy, even if the system of protection which it proposes to introduce is intended to be implemented by the authorities of the Member States, in accordance with Article 291(1) TFEU. Furthermore, the European Union has already concluded by itself, on the basis of Article 207 TFEU, a number of international agreements relating to the protection of appellations of origin and geographical indications, and the Council, which has not disputed the existence of that practice, has given no reasons to explain its departure from it in the present case.</p>

          draft revised agreement fell within the approximation of laws in the field of the internal market, for the purposes of Article 114 TFEU, and, therefore, within a competence shared between the European Union and its Member States. In this respect, the Council has wrongly drawn a parallel between the external and internal competences of the European Union. The European Union’s competence to negotiate the draft revised agreement may arise from the common commercial policy even though the common rules of the European Union for the protection of appellations of origin and geographical indications are, for their part, based on the common agricultural policy and on the approximation of the laws of the Member States and even though the relevant competences of the European Union have to date been exercised only in relation to appellations of origin and geographical indications for agricultural products, rather than non-agricultural products.

          In that regard, they submit, in essence, that, in order for an international agreement which is intended to be negotiated in a context other than that of the WTO and which relates to intellectual property matters other than those covered by the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights — which constitutes Annex 1C to the Agreement establishing the WTO signed in Marrakesh on 15 April 1994 and approved by Council Decision 94/800/EC of 22 December 1994 concerning the conclusion on behalf of the European Community, as regards matters within its competence, of the agreements reached in the Uruguay Round multilateral negotiations (1986-1994) (

        <p class="normal">However, in the present case, the context of the draft revised agreement does not support the conclusion that it displays such a specific link. First of all, it is administered by WIPO, and it is apparent from the convention establishing that organisation that the first objective of the latter is to promote the development of measures designed to facilitate the efficient protection of intellectual property and to harmonise national legislation in that field. Next, the objective of the draft revised agreement itself is not to facilitate trade by extending the reach of EU rules to third countries, but, as is the case with the common rules concerning appellations of origin and geographical indications adopted by the European Union on the basis of Article 114 TFEU, to establish a mechanism for protecting traditional products and providing information to consumers that applies to all contracting parties, including the European Union should it accede to the agreement. Finally, analysis of the content of the draft revised agreement confirms that the latter falls within the area of competence covered by Article 114 TFEU since its purpose is to establish a uniform procedural framework for the protection of appellations of origin and geographical indications, and that it is only secondarily and indirectly that the establishment of that procedural framework is capable of affecting trade in goods that benefit from such appellations and indications.</p>

          That assessment of the effects of the draft revised agreement is supported by the analysis which led the Court to hold that, in the light of the key role that the protection of intellectual property rights plays in trade in goods and services in general, and in combatting unlawful trade in particular, a draft international agreement providing for the establishment of a registration mechanism for geographical indications of the contracting parties and of a system of reciprocal protection of those indications against acts of unfair competition, which were analogous to those at issue in the present case, was such as to have direct and immediate effects on international trade (Opinion
