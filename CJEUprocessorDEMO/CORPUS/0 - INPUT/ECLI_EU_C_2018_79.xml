That, it is submitted, is shown by the formal presentation of the recommendation based on Article 292 TFEU and by its non-binding and conditional wording.

          The Kingdom of Belgium considered the action to be admissible. In essence, relying in particular on the judgments of 31 March 1971, Commission v Council, AETR (

          ) and on the principle of effective judicial protection, it claimed that the contested recommendation must be amenable to judicial review. First, it asserted that the recommendation produces ‘negative legal effects’ because, as was shown by the first, third and fourth pleas in law raised in its application, it infringes fundamental principles of EU law, namely the principle of conferral and the duty of sincere cooperation between EU institutions and between those institutions and the Member States. Second, it maintained, in connection with the second and fifth pleas in law raised in support of its action, that the contested recommendation stems from the intention to harmonise the application of the provisions of Articles 49 and 56 TFEU in the area of gambling and in fact constitutes a hidden directive, which must be reviewed by the EU Courts. It added that the contested recommendation produces indirect legal effects because, on the one hand, under their duty of sincere cooperation, the Member States are subject to an obligation to use their best endeavours to comply with it and, on the other, national courts and tribunals will also have to take the recommendation into consideration.

The General Court, in effect, ruled that the contested recommendation does not have, and was not intended to have, binding legal effects, with the result that it cannot be classified as a ‘challengeable act’ for the purposes of Article 263 TFEU. Consequently, the General Court dismissed the action as inadmissible and found that there was therefore no need to rule on the applications to intervene.</p>

The exclusion of recommendations from the scope of that review must, it submits, be subject to strict interpretation. Consequently, contrary to the General Court’s finding in the order under appeal, it should be possible to have recourse to the EU Courts in order for them to monitor the observance, by the institution which adopted the contested recommendation, of the principles of conferral, sincere cooperation and institutional balance, which are of fundamental importance in the division of powers between the European Union and its Member States as well as between the EU institutions. Even in a case involving a genuine recommendation, it submits, the General Court thus has jurisdiction to determine whether or not those principles had been infringed during the adoption of that recommendation, without requiring a full review of the material content thereof.</p>

Observance of the principle of institutional balance implies, as a consequence, that the EU Courts can verify whether the Commission had, in the present case, a substantive legal basis on which to adopt the contested recommendation.</p>

          ), the Court did not cast doubt on the admissibility of the Council’s action for annulment even though that action related to the presentation of the European Union’s position in the context of advisory opinion proceedings which had no binding effect. It suffices to note that that action was not directed against a recommendation within the meaning of the fifth paragraph of Article 288 TFEU, but rather against a decision of the Commission which, in accordance with the fourth paragraph of Article 288 TFEU, produces binding legal effects. Moreover, using as a pretext the fact that that decision was taken in the context of the European Union’s involvement in such proceedings is, as the Commission has correctly pointed out, incorrectly to confuse the nature of the effects of that decision and the nature of the advisory opinion proceedings in question.

          Thirdly, the argument of the Kingdom of Belgium alleging that, in the judgment of 31 March 1971, Commission v Council, AETR (

          ), the Court, for the purpose of ruling on the admissibility of the action for annulment, examined whether the Council act at issue in the case giving rise to that judgment was capable of producing legal effects as regards the prerogatives of the other EU institutions and the Member States, is not such as to invalidate the finding made in paragraph 37 of the present judgment.

          Suffice it to note, in this respect, that that act was a Council deliberation recorded in the minutes of a meeting, in regard to which the Court, in order to assess whether it could be challenged, examined whether it was intended to produce binding legal effects. The present case, by contrast, relates to a recommendation, which is expressly excluded under the first paragraph of Article 263 TFEU from the scope of the review of legality laid down by that article, as the Court, moreover, pointed out in paragraphs 38 and 39 of the judgment of 31 March 1971, Commission v Council, AETR (
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1971%3A32&amp;locale=en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch" hreflang="en" class="CourtLink">22/70</a>

          ) in the context of Article 173 of the EEC Treaty (subsequently Article 173 of the EC Treaty and then Article 230 EC). Moreover, as is clear from paragraphs 33 to 37 of the present judgment, the General Court examined whether the contested recommendation was intended to produce binding legal effects and correctly held that this was not the case.

          In the second place, in so far as the first two grounds of appeal allege infringement of Article 263 TFEU on the ground that the General Court ruled out, by the order under appeal, the possibility that the contested recommendation might be amenable to judicial review under that article, which would be contrary to the requirements stemming from the judgments of 23 April 1986, Les Verts v Parliament (
          <a href="./../../../../legal-content/EN/AUTO/?uri=ecli:ECLI%3AEU%3AC%3A1986%3A166&amp;locale=en" target="CourtTab" type="application/xml;notice=branch" hreflang="en" class="CourtLink">294/83</a>

          ), it should be pointed out that, unlike the cases which gave rise to those two judgments, the present case is characterised, not by the absence, in the Treaties, of a provision providing the right to bring an action for annulment such as that at issue in the present case, but by the existence of an express provision, namely, the first paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, which excludes recommendations from the scope of actions for annulment since those measures do not produce binding legal effects, a fact which the General Court correctly established in the present case.
