In the present case, such evidence is to be found in the objective pursued by the checks provided for in Paragraph 22(1a) of the BPolG, which does not differ from those pursued by border checks, in particular in so far as those checks are aimed at preventing or terminating unlawful entry into the German territory, which partly matches the definition given in Article 2, point 10, of Regulation No 562/2006, which states that the objective of border checks is to ensure that persons may be authorised to enter the territory of the Member States.</p>
