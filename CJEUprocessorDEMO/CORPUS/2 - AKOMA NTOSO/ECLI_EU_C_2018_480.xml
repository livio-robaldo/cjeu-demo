Directive 85/611 was amended on a number of occasions before being repealed, with effect from 1 July 2011, by Directive 2009/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 July 2009 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) ( OJ 2009 L 302, p. 32), which recast the former directive.</p>

            <p>Article 65(1) of the kildeskatteloven (Law on withholding tax) provides that all decisions to distribute dividends taken by a company resident in Denmark must stipulate that a percentage of the total amount distributed will be retained at source, unless otherwise provided.

            <p>Under the Danish rules, the rate of the withholding tax is reduced to 15% when the authorities of the State in which the UCITS concerned is resident are required to exchange information with the Danish authorities in accordance with a double taxation convention, another international convention or an administrative agreement for assistance in tax matters. For taxpayers resident in the European Union, the final taxation may not, in practice, exceed 15%, in accordance with that provision. In addition, the tax may be further reduced on the basis of tax conventions concluded between the Kingdom of Denmark and the State of residence of the UCITS concerned.</p>

            <p>The Law on withholding tax applies to UCITS established in Denmark, which are, therefore, a priori, subject to those rules on the taxation of dividends. However, it is clear from Article 65(8) of that law that the Minister for Taxation has power to adopt rules providing that the distribution of dividends to funds which fall within the scope of Article 16 C of the ligningslov ( `Article 16 C funds') are exempted from withholding tax.</p>

            <p>When the order concerning withholding tax was adopted, the Minister for Taxation used that power to exempt Article 16 C funds from all withholding tax. Under Article 38 of the order concerning withholding tax, a UCITS may be issued with an exemption certificate and qualify for the exemption from withholding tax on dividends provided that</p>

            <p>Under the rules that were in force until 1 June 2005, in order for a UCITS to be treated as an Article 16 C fund it had to make a minimum distribution. The minimum distribution forms the basis for taxing the income of the fund concerned at the level of its members.</p>

            <p>The rules for calculating the minimum distribution are set out in Article 16 C(2) to (6) of the ligningslov. Paragraph 2 of that article provides that the minimum distribution is the sum of the revenue and net amounts received during the tax year, with deductions made for losses and expenditure. Under Article 16 C(3) of the ligningslov, that calculation includes a number of specific sources of revenue listed in that article, particularly interest, share dividends, gains on receivables and financial contracts as well as gains on disposals of shares. In accordance with Article 16 C(4) and (5) of the ligningslov, Article 16 C funds may deduct allowable losses and administrative expenses.</p>

Eligibility for that status is still, however, subject to the condition that the UCITS concerned calculates a minimum distribution that is taxed in the hands of its members by means of a deduction at source made by that undertaking.</p>

The products offered by the applicants in the main proceedings are accessible to clients resident in Denmark but are not actively marketed in that Member State.

            <p>The applicants in the main proceedings brought claims before the national court for repayment of withholding tax levied on dividend distributions made by companies established in Denmark, which they received between 2000 and 2009, arguing that UCITS resident in Denmark, unlike non-resident UCITS, can obtain an exemption from withholding tax. They submit that national tax rules set two conditions for exemption, namely that the UCITS concerned is resident in Denmark and that it calculates and declares its income in accordance with Danish tax rules. Non-resident UCITS cannot, by definition, satisfy the first of those conditions and it is impossible, or extremely difficult, for them to satisfy the second, particularly as they have no incentive to do so, given that, on account of the first condition, they are in any event ineligible for exemption from withholding tax.</p>

            <p>The Minister for Taxation accepts that the effect of the Danish system is that, in certain circumstances, UCITS established in Denmark and UCITS established in another Member State are subject to different tax treatment as regards dividends received from companies established in Denmark. However, he considers that restriction to be justified, first, by the need to safeguard the coherence of the tax system and, second, by the need to ensure a balanced allocation between the Member States of the power to impose taxes.</p>

They further submit that the reference made by the Advocate General to the fact that certain UCITS that are not resident in the Kingdom of Denmark carried out minimum distributions is wrong in fact and the circumstances surrounding such UCITS were not the subject of debate before the Court.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be noted that, under the second paragraph of Article 252 TFEU, it is the duty of the Advocate General, acting with complete impartiality and independence, to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases which, in accordance with the Statute of the Court of Justice, require his involvement. The Court is not bound either by the Advocate General's Opinion or by the reasoning on which it is based (judgment of 22 June 2017, Federatie Nederlandse Vakvereniging and Others, C‑126/16, EU:C:2017:489, paragraph 31 and the case-law cited).</p>

As a consequence, the fact that a party disagrees with the Advocate General's Opinion, irrespective of the questions examined in the Opinion, cannot in itself constitute grounds justifying the reopening of the oral procedure (judgments of 25 October 2017, Polbud -- Wykonawstwo, C‑106/16, EU:C:2017:804, paragraph 24, and of 29 November 2017, King, C‑214/16, EU:C:2017:914, paragraph 27 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>By its question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Articles 56 and 63 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding legislation of a Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, under which the dividends distributed by a company resident in that Member State to a non-resident UCITS are subject to withholding tax, while dividends distributed to a UCITS resident in that same Member State are exempt from such tax, provided that the undertaking concerned makes a minimum distribution to its members, or technically calculates a minimum distribution, and withholds on that actual or notional minimum distribution the tax payable by its members.</p>

After that date there is no longer a requirement to actually make a minimum distribution to members, but, in order to qualify for that status, the UCITS concerned must calculate a minimum distribution which is taxed in the hands of its members by means of a deduction at source made by that undertaking.

That legislation thus prevents economic double taxation which would occur if the dividends were taxed at the level of the UCITS concerned and at the level of its members. Second, the legislation seeks to ensure that the dividends distributed by companies established in Denmark do not elude the Kingdom of Denmark's power to impose taxes on account of the exemption they enjoy at the level of UCITS, and are actually taxed once.</p>
