In essence, it was of the opinion that disclosure of those documents would be liable to affect the proper conduct of the investigation opened in respect of the Federal Republic of Germany. It also stated that partial access to the documents at issue, under Article 4(6) of Regulation No 1049/2001, was not possible in this case. Finally, it stated that there was no overriding public interest, within the meaning of the last clause of Article 4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001, in disclosure of those documents.</p>

            <p>The Kingdom of Sweden recalls that the principle of the greatest possible openness applies to all the activities of the EU institutions, as is clear from Article 1 TEU, Article 15 TFEU and Article 42 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It argues that, in accordance with the judgment of 1 July 2008, Sweden and Turco v Council ( C‑39/05 P and C‑52/05 P, EU:C:2008:374), public scrutiny of the institutions' activities is one of the fundamental pillars of a democratic society and that exceptions to that principle are to be interpreted strictly, as is apparent from recitals 1 to 4 of Regulation No 1049/2001.</p>

            <p>The Kingdom of Sweden is of the view that the considerations set out in paragraphs 63 and 80 of the judgment under appeal are incorrect in law, since the General Court, firstly, should not have held that the Commission could base its refusal of access to the documents at issue, concerning an EU Pilot procedure, under the exception relating to investigations provided for in the third indent of Article 4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001, on the existence of a general presumption of confidentiality covering certain categories of documents and, on the other, should have held that the Commission was required in that case to make a specific and individual examination of the documents at issue.</p>

            <p>In the view of the Kingdom of Sweden, first of all, it cannot validly be claimed, contrary to the assertion in paragraph 62 of the judgment under appeal, that the EU Pilot procedure has the sole purpose of avoiding an action for failure to fulfil obligations, since that procedure is different in nature and purpose in that it seeks, in particular, to allow the Commission to request purely factual information. Next, in the EU Pilot procedures, the Commission communicates with a Member State without, at that stage, alleging that it has infringed EU law. Finally, the documents in EU Pilot procedures rarely contain details of the position adopted by the Commission which could be relied on in any proceedings for failure to fulfil obligations.</p>

            <p>The Kingdom of Sweden is of the opinion that it is clear from paragraphs 47 to 49 of the judgment of 14 November 2013, LPN and Finland v Commission ( C‑514/11 P and C‑605/11 P, EU:C:2013:738), that, beyond the qualitative requirements to be met by the procedure to which the document at issue relates, the application of a general presumption of confidentiality also presupposes that the number of those documents is sufficiently great. It argues that, accordingly, the considerations of the General Court set out in paragraphs 74 and 75 of the judgment under appeal are incorrect in law and that, where a request for access relates to only two documents, there can be no interest of efficient administration capable of justifying the application of a general presumption of confidentiality.</p>

            <p>The Kingdom of Denmark and the Republic of Finland submit that the EU Pilot procedures may cover a wide range of cases from purely factual situations to matters comparable to the pre-litigation stage of procedures for failure to fulfil obligations, so that it is only after a specific assessment of the documents covered by the request for access that it is possible to decide whether they may be disclosed. The Republic of Finland is also of the view that an examination of the manner in which a Member State complies with EU law is not sufficient to justify the application of a general presumption of confidentiality as regards the documents connected with that examination and that it is the decision to open the formal procedure provided for in Article 258 TFEU which constitutes the condition for that general presumption to apply.</p>

            <p>Those findings are corroborated by the Commission EU Pilot Evaluation Report of 3 March 2010 (COM(2010) 70 final) and the Second Commission EU Pilot Evaluation Report of 21 December 2011 (COM(2011) 930 final). In particular, on page 3 of the latter report, the Commission provided a description of the EU Pilot procedure: `EU Pilot is the main tool for the Commission to communicate with the participating Member States on issues raising a question concerning the correct application of EU law or the conformity of the law in a Member State with EU law at an early stage (i.e. before an infringement procedure is launched under Article 258 TFEU). Wherever there might be recourse to the infringement proceeding, as a general rule, EU Pilot is used before the first step in such a proceeding under Article 258 TFEU is taken by the Commission. This replaces the previous regular practice whereby the Commission sent administrative letters for this purpose.'</p>

            <p>It is apparent from those findings and those reports that the EU Pilot procedure constitutes a cooperation procedure between the Commission and the Member States which makes it possible to ascertain whether EU law has been complied with and correctly applied within those States. That type of procedure seeks efficiently to resolve any infringements of EU law by avoiding, so far as possible, the formal opening of an infringement procedure under Article 258 TFEU.</p>

            <p>The Court has held, in the judgment of 14 November 2013, LPN and Finland v Commission ( C‑514/11 P and C‑605/11 P, EU:C:2013:738), that documents relating to an infringement procedure during the pre-litigation stage may be covered by the general presumption of confidentiality. The Court held, in paragraph 65 of that judgment, that `it can be presumed that the disclosure of the documents concerning an infringement procedure during its pre-litigation stage risks altering the nature of that procedure and changing the way it proceeds and, accordingly, that disclosure would in principle undermine the protection of the purpose of investigations, within the meaning of the third indent of Article 4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001'.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, as the General Court noted in paragraph 66 of the judgment under appeal, without erring in law, the EU Pilot procedure merely formalised or structured the exchanges of information which traditionally occurred between the Commission and the Member States during the informal stage of an inquiry into possible infringements of EU law.</p>

            <p>As regards the possible effect of the Commission's letter of 30 April 2012, referred to in paragraph 15 of this judgment, on the obligation to disclose the documents at issue, it must be noted that that letter does not constitute the Commission's definitive decision not to commence a formal infringement procedure against the Federal Republic of Germany, but merely states its preliminary intention to close the investigation. The Commission's definitive decision not to commence a formal infringement procedure against the Federal Republic of Germany was not taken until 27 September 2012, with the closure of the EU Pilot procedure at issue. In consequence, although the contested decision, dated 21 June 2012, was adopted after the letter of 30 April 2012, the fact remains that that decision was adopted before the rejection of the commencement of a formal infringement procedure on 27 September 2012. Accordingly, the letter of 30 April 2012 is irrelevant to the Commission's ability to take as its basis the general presumption of confidentiality referred to in the preceding paragraph of this judgment.</p>

Referring to paragraph 44 of the judgment of 1 July 2008, Sweden and Turco v Council ( C‑39/05 P and C‑52/05 P, EU:C:2008:374), the Kingdom of Sweden argues that it is not for the Commission to decide upon the best way of serving the public interest, but to ascertain that there is no overriding public interest justifying the disclosure of documents.</p>
