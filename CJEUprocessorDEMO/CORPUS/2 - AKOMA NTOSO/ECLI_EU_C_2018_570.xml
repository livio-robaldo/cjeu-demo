That card was refused to her on the ground that she was the unmarried partner of Mr Rado and that Regulation 9 of the 2006 Regulations provided that only the spouse or civil partner of a United Kingdom national could be considered a family member of that national.</p>

            <p>The Upper Tribunal found, first, that the only material difference between the case before it and the case which gave rise to the judgment of 7 July 1992, Singh ( C‑370/90, EU:C:1992:296) is that Ms Banger is the unmarried partner of a Union citizen, whereas in the former case Mr and Mrs Singh were married. The principles developed by the Court in that judgment could, therefore, be applied to a case such as that in question in the main proceedings. Secondly, the Upper Tribunal noted that a differently constituted chamber of that tribunal had already held that a person who had been refused a residence card as an `extended family member' had no right of appeal under the 2006 Regulations.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, having regard to the information in the request for a preliminary ruling, it must be found that, by its first and second questions, which must be examined together, the Upper Tribunal (Immigration and Asylum Chamber) asks, in essence, whether Article 21(1) TFEU must be interpreted as requiring the Member State of which a Union citizen is a national to grant or facilitate the provision of a residence authorisation to the partner with whom that Union citizen has not contracted a registered partnership ( `the unregistered partner'), a third-country national with whom the Union citizen has a durable relationship that is duly attested, where the Union citizen, having exercised his right of freedom of movement to work in a second Member State, in accordance with the conditions laid down in Directive 2004/38, returns with his partner to the Member State of which he is a national in order to reside there.</p>

That directive cannot, therefore, confer a right on a third-country national, who is the Union citizen's unregistered partner, in the Member State of which the Union citizen is a national, for his application for residence authorisation to be facilitated by that Member State.</p>

            <p>However, the Court has acknowledged, in certain cases, that third-country nationals, family members of a Union citizen, who were not eligible on the basis of Directive 2004/38 for a derived right of residence in the Member State of which that citizen is a national, could, nevertheless, be accorded such a right on the basis of Article 21(1) TFEU (judgment of 5 June 2018, Coman and Others, C‑673/16, EU:C:2018:385, paragraph 23).</p>

            <p>That consideration is based upon settled case-law, according to which, in essence, if no such derived right of residence were granted to such a third-country national, a Union citizen would be discouraged from leaving the Member State of which he is a national in order to exercise his right of residence under Article 21(1) TFEU in another Member State because he is uncertain whether he will be able to continue in his Member State of origin a family life which has been created or strengthened, with that third-country national, in the host Member State, during a genuine residence (see, to that effect, judgments of 12 March 2014, O. and B., C‑456/12, EU:C:2014:135, paragraph 54, and of 5 June 2018, Coman and Others, C‑673/16, EU:C:2018:385, paragraph 24).</p>

Even though Directive 2004/38 does not cover the return of that Union citizen to the Member State of which he is a national in order to reside there, it should be applied by analogy (see, to that effect, judgments of 12 March 2014, O. and B., C‑456/12, EU:C:2014:135, paragraphs 50 and 61 and the case-law cited, and of 5 June 2018, Coman and Others, C‑673/16, EU:C:2018:385, paragraph 25).</p>

Consequently, a third-country national having such a relationship with a Union citizen who has exercised his right of freedom of movement and returns to the Member State of which he is national in order to reside there, must not, when that Union citizen returns to that Member State, be the subject of less favourable treatment than that provided for under that directive for a third-country national having a durable relationship that is duly attested with a Union citizen exercising his right of freedom of movement in Member States other than that of which he is a national.</p>

As the Advocate General observed in point 35 of his Opinion, although in that judgment the Court held that a third-country national who does not have the status of a family member may not enjoy, in the host Member State, a derived right of residence under Directive 2004/38 or Article 21(1) TFEU, that judgment does not, however, exclude the obligation for that Member State to facilitate the entry and residence of such a national in accordance with Article 3(2) of that directive.</p>

The fourth question must be understood in that context. The Upper Tribunal raises, therefore, not the possible absence of review by a court for those persons, but whether Directive 2004/38 requires a redress procedure whereby matters of both fact and law may be reviewed by a court.</p>

            <p>Since the provisions of Directive 2004/38 must be interpreted in a manner which complies with the requirements flowing from Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 June 2013, ZZ, C‑300/11, EU:C:2013:363, paragraph 50), those persons must have available to them an effective judicial remedy against a decision, under that provision, permitting a review of the legality of that decision as regards matters of both fact and law in the light of EU law (see, to that effect, judgment of 17 November 2011, Gaydarov, C‑430/10, EU:C:2011:749, paragraph 41).</p>

            <p>Consequently, it must be found that the procedural safeguards provided for in Article 31(1) of Directive 2004/38 are applicable to the persons envisaged in point (b) of the first subparagraph of Article 3(2) of that directive.</p>

            <p>As regards the content of those procedural safeguards, according to the Court's case-law, a person envisaged in Article 3(2) of that directive is entitled to a review by a court of whether the national legislation and its application have remained within the limits of the discretion set by that directive (judgment of 5 September 2012, Rahman and Others, C‑83/11, EU:C:2012:519, paragraph 25).</p>

            <p>As regards its review of the discretion enjoyed by the competent national authorities, the national court must ascertain in particular whether the contested decision is based on a sufficiently solid factual basis. That review must also relate to compliance with procedural safeguards, which is of fundamental importance enabling the court to ascertain whether the factual and legal elements on which the exercise of the power of assessment depends were present (see, by analogy, judgment of 4 April 2017, Fahimian, C‑544/15, EU:C:2017:255, paragraphs 45 and 46). Those safeguards include, in accordance with Article 3(2) of Directive 2004/38, the obligation for those authorities to undertake an extensive examination of the applicant's personal circumstances and to justify any denial of entry or residence.</p>

            <p>In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the fourth question is that Article 3(2) of Directive 2004/38 must be interpreted as meaning that the third-country nationals envisaged in that provision must have available to them a redress procedure in order to challenge a decision to refuse a residence authorisation taken against them, following which the national court must be able to ascertain whether the refusal decision is based on a sufficiently solid factual basis and whether the procedural safeguards were complied with. Those safeguards include the obligation for the competent national authorities to undertake an extensive examination of the applicant's personal circumstances and to justify any denial of entry or residence.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 21(1) TFEU must be interpreted as requiring the Member State of which a Union citizen is a national to facilitate the provision of a residence authorisation to the unregistered partner, a third-country national with whom that Union citizen has a durable relationship that is duly attested, where the Union citizen, having exercised his right of freedom of movement to work in a second Member State, in accordance with the conditions laid down in Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States amending Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 and repealing Directives 64/221/EEC, 68/360/EEC, 72/194/EEC, 73/148/EEC, 75/34/EEC, 75/35/EEC, 90/364/EEC, 90/365/EEC and 93/96/EEC, returns with his partner to the Member State of which he is a national in order to reside there. 2. Article 21(1) TFEU must be interpreted as meaning that a decision to refuse a residence authorisation to the third‑country national and unregistered partner of a Union citizen, where that Union citizen, having exercised his right of freedom of movement to work in a second Member State, in accordance with the conditions laid down in Directive 2004/38, returns with his partner to the Member State of which he is a national in order to reside there, must be founded on an extensive examination of the applicant's personal circumstances and be justified by reasons. 3. Article 3(2) of Directive 2004/38 must be interpreted as meaning that the third-country nationals envisaged in that provision must have available to them a redress procedure in order to challenge a decision to refuse a residence authorisation taken against them, following which the national court must be able to ascertain whether the refusal decision is based on a sufficiently solid factual basis and whether the procedural safeguards were complied with. Those safeguards include the obligation for the competent national authorities to undertake an extensive examination of the applicant's personal circumstances and to justify any denial of entry or residence.</p>
