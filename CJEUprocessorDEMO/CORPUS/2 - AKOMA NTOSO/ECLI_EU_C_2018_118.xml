            <p>Western Sahara Campaign UK brought two actions before the High Court of Justice (England &amp; Wales), Queen's Bench Division (Administrative Court). The first of those actions concerns the question whether the tax and customs authority in the United Kingdom is entitled to accept the importation, into the United Kingdom, of goods certified as originating in Western Sahara, as if they were goods certified as originating in the Kingdom of Morocco for the purposes of the Association Agreement. The second action challenges the fisheries policy developed by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in the United Kingdom, on the ground that that policy provides for the inclusion of the waters adjacent to the territory of Western Sahara within the scope of the domestic legislation intended to implement the Fisheries Partnership Agreement, the 2013 Protocol and the acts of secondary legislation whereby the European Union allocated fishing opportunities to the Member States pursuant to that agreement and that protocol.</p>

            <p>Before the referring court, Western Sahara Campaign UK submits that the Association Agreement, the Fisheries Partnership Agreement, the 2013 Protocol and the acts of secondary legislation which allocate fishing opportunities to the Member States on the basis of those texts are contrary to Article 3(5) TEU, by virtue of which the European Union is to contribute to the strict observance of international law, and in particular the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, in its relations with the wider world, in so far as those various international agreements are applicable to the territory of Western Sahara and to the waters adjacent thereto. According to Western Sahara Campaign UK, the inclusion of that territory and those waters within their territorial scope is manifestly incompatible with international law and, more specifically, with the right to self-determination, Article 73 of the Charter of the United Nations, the provisions of the Convention on the Law of the Sea and the obligations incumbent on States and other subjects of international law to bring to an end serious breaches of a peremptory norm of international law, not to recognise an illegal situation resulting from such a breach, and not to provide assistance for the commission of an internationally wrongful act. Further, the Association Agreement, the Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the 2013 Protocol were not concluded on behalf of the people of Western Sahara nor in consultation with its representatives. Last, there is no evidence that the people of Western Sahara have derived any benefit from those three international agreements.</p>

            <p>By means of its first question, the referring court sought from the Court an interpretation of the Association Agreement, asking whether the references to the `Kingdom of Morocco' in that agreement were to be interpreted as referring solely to the sovereign territory of that State, and therefore precluding products originating in Western Sahara from being imported into the European Union free of customs duties pursuant to that agreement.</p>

            <p>By means of its second question, referred on the premiss that the Association Agreement did in fact permit products originating in Western Sahara to be imported into the European Union free of customs duties, the referring court sought to ascertain whether that agreement was valid having regard to Article 3(5) TEU.</p>

            <p>By means of its third question, the referring court raised with the Court, on the basis of a premiss analogous to that underlying its second question, the issue of the validity of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement and of the 2013 Protocol. In that regard, the referring court sought to ascertain, in essence, to what extent the European Union was entitled, having regard to Article 3(5) TEU, to conclude, with the Kingdom of Morocco, international agreements permitting the exploitation of the natural resources of the waters adjacent to the territory of Western Sahara. The referring court states that it is arguable that the conclusion of such international agreements is not generally and absolutely prohibited, notwithstanding, on the one hand, the fact that the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Morocco over Western Sahara is not recognised by the international community, and, on the other, the extended occupation of that non-self-governing territory by the Kingdom of Morocco. However, conclusion of those agreements, according to that court, is subject to the twofold requirement that they are in accordance with the wishes of the people of Western Sahara and are for their benefit. In this case, the referring court considers that it is for the Court to assess to what extent the Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the 2013 Protocol respect that twofold requirement.</p>

          <content eId="para_6770__content">
            <p>By its fourth question, the referring court sought to ascertain, in essence, whether a person such as the applicant in the main proceedings, whose standing to bring proceedings is established under national law, might be entitled to challenge the validity of international agreements such as the Association Agreement, the Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the 2013 Protocol, and the validity of the relevant acts of conclusion and implementation, on the ground that the European Union had infringed international law. On that issue, the referring court stated that, if the disputes in the main proceedings had to be resolved in the light of domestic law alone, the actions would be dismissed, by reason of the fact that they require an assessment of the legality of the actions of a foreign sovereign. The referring court has also pointed out that the International Court of Justice, in its judgment of 15 June 1954, Case of the Monetary Gold Removed from Rome in 1943 (ICJ Reports 1954, p. 19), held that its Statute prohibited it from making findings that impugned the conduct of, or affected the rights of, a State that was not a party to the proceedings before it and that had not consented to be bound by its decisions. The referring court added, however, that since the subject matter of the disputes in the main proceedings was the validity of EU acts, if the Court were to declare that it had no jurisdiction, in a situation where there is serious doubt concerning the validity of the acts at issue, that might undermine the efficacy of Article 3(5) TEU.</p>

            <p>As is stated in paragraph 37 of the present judgment, the starting point for that question is the premiss that the Fisheries Partnership Agreement and the 2013 Protocol permit the exploitation of the natural resources in the waters adjacent to the territory of Western Sahara. That premiss itself implies that those waters are included with the territorial scope of both that agreement and that protocol, with the result that vessels flying the flags of the Member States can enter those waters, by virtue of those two international agreements, in order to exploit the resources at issue.</p>

            <p>The Fisheries Partnership Agreement contains three provisions determining its territorial scope. First, Article 11 of that agreement states that it is applicable, as regards the Kingdom of Morocco, to `the territory of Morocco and to the waters under Moroccan jurisdiction'. Second, Article 5 of that agreement provides, as regards, more specifically, fishing activities, that vessels flying the flags of the Member States are permitted to `engage in fishing activities in [the] fishing zones [of the Kingdom of Morocco]'. Last, Article 2(a) of that agreement states that `Moroccan fishing zone' means the `waters falling within the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the Kingdom of Morocco'.</p>

As such, the Fisheries Partnership Agreement is one of a body of agreements that is framed by the Association Agreement.</p>

            <p>The structure of that body of agreements is clearly set out in the 2013 Protocol, which must be taken into account for the purposes of the interpretation of the Fisheries Partnership Agreement, since that protocol constitutes a subsequent agreement between the parties to that agreement, within the meaning of Article 31(3)(a) of the Vienna Convention. Article 1 of the 2013 Protocol states that both it and the Fisheries Partnership Agreement form part of the Association Agreement, the objectives of which they help to fulfil.</p>

In that regard, let it suffice, however, to observe, without there being any need even to examine whether any joint intention of the parties to the Fisheries Partnership Agreement to give that expression a special meaning, in order to take such circumstances into account, would have been compatible with the rules of international law that are binding on the European Union, the existence of such a joint intention cannot, in any event, be identified in this case since the Kingdom of Morocco has categorically denied that it is an occupying power or an administrative power with respect to the territory of Western Sahara.</p>
