            <p>The background to the dispute is set out by the General Court in paragraphs 2 to 28 of the judgment under appeal as follows: `2 By the [Methacrylates decision], the Commission ... imposed a fine of EUR 219131250 on Arkema SA and its subsidiaries Altuglas International SA and Altumax Europe SAS (taken together, `Arkema') jointly and severally for participating in a cartel ( `the original fine'). 3. The [respondents], Total SA and Elf Aquitaine SA, which, during the period of the infringement found in the Methacrylates decision, were the parent companies of Arkema, were found liable jointly and severally for payment of the original fine to the extent of EUR 181350000 and EUR 140400000 respectively. 4. On 7 September 2006 Arkema paid the original fine in full and subsequently brought an action against the Methacrylates decision ( `Methacrylates judicial proceedings'), as did the [respondents], simultaneously and independently. Methacrylates judicial proceedings before the General Court 5. On 4 and 10 August 2006 respectively the [respondents] and Arkema brought an action for the annulment of the Methacrylates decision. 6. In Case T‑206/06 the [respondents] claimed primarily that the Methacrylates decision should be annulled. 7. Alternatively they also claimed that the original fine imposed jointly and severally on Arkema and themselves should be reduced.</p>

            <p>On 24 July 2008 the Commission wrote a letter to Arkema asking it to confirm that its payment of 7 September 2006 had been made ``on behalf of all the debtors jointly and severally liable '', adding that, first, ``without such confirmation and if the [Methacrylates decision was] annulled in relation to the undertaking on whose behalf the payment was made '', it, the Commission, would ``repay the sum of EUR 219131250 with interest '' and, secondly, that ``if all or part of the fine [was] upheld by the Court of Justice in relation to any of the other joint and several debtors '' it ``[would] demand from that debtor any sum remaining due plus default interest at the rate of 6.09% ''. 9. By letter of 25 September 2008 Arkema informed the Commission that it had paid the sum of EUR 219131250 ``in its capacity as joint and several debtor and that, since that payment, the Commission [had] received full satisfaction as against Arkema and as against all the other joint and several debtors ''. To that extent, Arkema ``regretted that it [was] unable to authorise the Commission to retain any sum whatever should its action before the Community court [be] crowned with success ''.</p>

            <p>The [respondents'] action was dismissed by judgment of 7 June 2011, Total and Elf Aquitaine v Commission ( T‑206/06, ... EU:T:2011:250). 12. On the other hand, the action brought separately by Arkema against the Methacrylates decision was partly upheld by the judgment of 7 June 2011, Arkema France and Others v Commission ( T‑217/06, ... EU:T:2011:251), in so far as the fine imposed on Arkema was reduced to EUR 113343750. 13. In the [judgment of 7 June 2011, Arkema France and Others v Commission ( T‑217/06, EU:T:2011:251)], the Court found that, in the exercise of its unlimited jurisdiction, the increase in the fine applied to Arkema as a deterrent should be reduced in order to take account of the fact that, on the day on which the fine was imposed, Arkema was no longer controlled by the [respondents] (judgment [of 7 June 2011, Arkema France and Others v Commission, T‑217/06, EU:T:2011:251], paragraphs 338 and 339). 14. No appeal was lodged against the judgment [of 7 June 2011, Arkema France and Others v Commission ( T‑217/06, EU:T:2011:251)], so that it has acquired the binding authority of a judgment which has become final. 15. The Commission repaid Arkema, with value date of 5 July 2011, a total of EUR 119247033.72 (principal amount of EUR 105787500 plus interest of EUR 13459533.72). The [contested] letters Letter of 24 June 2011 16. In the letter of 24 June 2011 the Commission informed the [respondents] that, ``in compliance with the judgment [of 7 June 2011, Arkema France and Others v Commission ( T‑217/06, EU:T:2011:251)], [it] would repay Arkema the amount of the reduction in the fine decided upon by the Court ''. 17. In the same letter of 24 June 2011, the Commission also asked the [respondents] ``at the same time, should an appeal be lodged before the Court of Justice against the judgment [of 7 June 2011, Total and Elf Aquitaine v Commission ( T‑206/06, EU:T:2011:250)], for payment of the amount outstanding, together with default interest at the rate of 6.09% from 8 September 2006 '', that is to say, EUR 68006250, for the payment of which Total was held ``jointly and severally '' liable as to EUR 27056250 plus default interest, that is to say, a total of EUR 88135466.52.</p>

            <p>By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 1 September 2011, the respondents brought an action for annulment against the contested letters before the General Court, seeking, in the alternative, the reduction of the sums demanded in those letters, and in the further alternative, the annulment of the default interest.</p>

            <p>By separate document lodged at the Court Registry on 17 November 2011, the Commission raised an objection of inadmissibility under Article 114 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court. It argued, in particular, that the contested letters were acts which cannot be challenged as they were devoid of binding legal effects of such a kind as to affect the respondents, and that the payment obligation on them derived solely from the Methacrylates decision.</p>

          <content eId="para_5376__content">
            <p>In that connection, the General Court held, in particular, that, as regards the amount of the principal demanded from the respondents in the contested letters, those letters did not affect their interests by bringing about a distinct change in their legal position, within the meaning of Article 263 TFEU, as a result of the Methacrylates decision.</p>

          <content eId="para_5377__content">
            <p>However, as regards the obligation to pay default interest, the General Court held that that did not arise at all from that decision, or from the judgments of 7 June 2011, Total and Elf Aquitaine v Commission ( T‑206/06, EU:T:2011:250), or of 7 June 2011, Arkema France and Others v Commission ( T‑217/06, EU:T:2011:251), because Arkema had paid the whole of the original fine immediately after the decision, so that the disputed act did alter their legal position by increasing the amount due from the respondents under that decision.</p>

            <p>In essence, the Commission criticises the General Court for having wrongly stated, in paragraph 113 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had `received full satisfaction', although, by its letter of 25 September 2008, Arkema did not declare common payment. That institution seeks, under the pretext of contradictory reasoning, to challenge the General Court's interpretation of that letter in the exercise of its power to evaluate the facts.</p>

            <p>Although the question whether the grounds of a judgment of the General Court are contradictory or inadequate is a point of law which is amenable, as such, to judicial review on appeal (see, in particular, judgments of 8 February 2007, Groupe Danone v Commission, C‑3/06 P, EU:C:2007:88, paragraph 45, and of 14 October 2010, Deutsche Telekom v Commission, C‑280/08 P, EU:C:2010:603, paragraph 123), such is not the case of an assessment of facts which, save where the clear sense of the evidence has been distorted, which has not been argued in the present case, is not, according to settled case-law, subject to review by the Court of Justice (see, to that effect, in particular, judgments of 10 July 2014, Greece v Commission, C‑391/13P, not published, EU:C:2014:2061, paragraph 29, and of 20 January 2016, Toshiba Corporation v Commission, C‑373/14 P, EU:C:2016:26, paragraph 40).</p>

            <p>By the first part of the first ground of appeal, the Commission submits that the contested letters are merely demands for payment pursuant to the Methacrylates decision, preparing for the possible enforcement of that decision following the judgments of 7 June 2011, Total and Elf Aquitaine v Commission ( T‑206/06, EU:T:2011:250), and of 7 June 2011, Arkema France and Others v Commission ( T‑217/06, EU:T:2011:251). However, those letters do not yet constitute an `enforcement measure' and, therefore, do not set out the Commission's final position.

            <p>By the second part of the first ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the content of the contested letters shows that they do not produce binding legal effects.

            <p>By the third part of the first ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the contested letters added nothing to the content of the Methacrylates decision. The respondents' obligation to pay the fine and the interest thereon is simply the result of the Methacrylates decision, read in the light of the judgments of 7 June 2011, Total and Elf Aquitaine v Commission ( T‑206/06, EU:T:2011:250), and of 7 June 2011, Arkema France and Others v Commission ( T‑217/06, EU:T:2011:251), and the order of 7 February 2012, Total and Elf Aquitaine v Commission ( C‑421/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:60). Thus, as is clear from the case-law of the General Court and the Court of Justice, the Commission does not have any discretion in this regard, for the fixing of default interest flows from the relevant provisions of Regulation (EU, Euratom) No 966/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2012 on the financial rules applicable to the general budget of the Union and repealing Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 1605/2002 ( OJ 2012 L 298, p. 1, `the Financial Regulation'), and its implementing regulation, Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 1268/2012 of 29 October 2012 on the rules of application of Regulation No 966/2012 ( OJ 2012 L 362, p. 1).</p>

            <p>As regards the admissibility of that ground of appeal, in relation to its second and third parts, it follows from the provisions of Article 168(1)(d) and Article 169(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice that an appeal must indicate precisely the contested elements of the judgment which the appellant seeks to have set aside and the legal arguments specifically advanced in support of the appeal. An appeal which merely repeats or reproduces verbatim the pleas in law and arguments previously submitted to the General Court, including those based on facts expressly rejected by the General Court, does not satisfy the requirement to state reasons under those provisions (see, in particular, judgment of 3 October 2013, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council, C‑583/11 P, EU:C:2013:625, paragraph 46 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>However, provided that the appellant challenges the interpretation or application of EU law by the General Court, the points of law examined at first instance may be discussed again in the course of an appeal. Indeed, if an appellant could not thus base his appeal on pleas in law and arguments already relied on before the General Court, an appeal would be deprived of part of its purpose (judgments of 12 September 2006, Reynolds Tobacco and Others v Commission, C‑131/03 P, EU:C:2006:541, paragraph 51, and of 3 October 2013, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council, C‑583/11 P, EU:C:2013:625, paragraph 47).</p>

            <p>In the present case, by its first ground of appeal, in particular in its second and third parts, the Commission does not seek a mere re-examination of the application submitted to the General Court, but specifically seeks to challenge the legal reasoning which led the General Court to hold that the contested letters were such as to produce binding legal effects so as to bring about a change in the position of the undertakings concerned.</p>

            <p>As to the substance of the first ground of appeal, the parts of which must be examined together, it must be recalled, as a preliminary point, that it follows from settled case-law as regards the admissibility of an action for annulment that, in order to determine whether an act may be subject to such an appeal, importance must be given to the substance of that act, the form in which an act or decision is adopted being in principle irrelevant to the right to challenge such acts (see to that effect, in particular, judgments of 22 June 2000, Netherlands v Commission, C‑147/96, EU:C:2000:335, paragraph 27, and of 17 July 2008, Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, C‑521/06 P, EU:C:2008:422, paragraph 43).</p>

          <content eId="para_5406__content">
            <p>In that connection, it is also clear from settled case-law that only measures the legal effects of which are binding on, and capable of affecting the interests of, the applicant by bringing about a distinct change in his legal position may be the subject of an action for annulment (see, in particular, judgments of 17 July 2008, Athinaïki Techniki v Commission, C‑521/06 P, EU:C:2008:422, paragraph 29; of 26 January 2010, Internationaler Hilfsfonds v Commission, C‑362/08 P, EU:C:2010:40, paragraph 51; and of 9 December 2014, Schönberger v Parliament, C‑261/13 P, EU:C:2014:2423, paragraph 13).</p>

            <p>Thus, an action for annulment is, in principle, only available against a measure by which the institution concerned definitively determines its position upon the conclusion of an administrative procedure. On the other hand, intermediate measures whose purpose is to prepare for the definitive decision, or measures which are mere confirmation of an earlier measure or purely implementing measures, cannot be treated as acts open to challenge, in that such acts are not intended to produce autonomous binding legal effects compared with those of the act of the EU institution which is prepared, confirmed or enforced (see, to that effect, in particular, judgments of 12 September 2006, Reynolds Tobacco and Others v Commission, C‑131/03 P, EU:C:2006:541, paragraph 55; of 6 December 2007, Commission v Ferriere Nord, C‑516/06 P, EU:C:2007:763, paragraph 29; and of 26 January 2010, Internationaler Hilfsfonds v Commission, C‑362/08 P, EU:C:2010:40, paragraph 52).</p>

            <p>It is from that perspective that the Commission, in its first ground of appeal, argues essentially that, as regards the obligation to pay the default interest demanded, the contested letters are not intended to produce binding legal effects separate from those deriving from the Methacrylates decision, since that obligation to pay default interest arises only from that decision and the relevant regulatory provisions, and that those letters added nothing to that decision.

However, the amount of the fine imposed, as such, on the respondents remained unchanged as a result of the judgment of 7 June 2011, Total and Elf Aquitaine v Commission ( T‑206/06, EU:T:2011:250) which was further confirmed by the order of 7 February 2012, Total and Elf Aquitaine v Commission ( C‑421/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:60, paragraph 83).</p>

            <p>In the present case, the joint and several liability of the respondents with regard to Arkema was purely derivative of that of their subsidiary, to the exclusion of any other factor.

            <p>In that connection, the Methacrylates decision contains, in Article 2 thereof, provisions on the principal fine imposed and the interest to pay in the case of non-payment, which are ancillary to it. At the date the action was brought in the case which gave rise to the judgment under appeal, the appeal before the Court in Case C‑421/11 P relating to that decision was still being heard. Furthermore, following the order of 7 February 2012, Total and Elf Aquitaine v Commission ( C‑421/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:60), that decision had become definitive for the respondents with respect to all its elements, including the question of interest.</p>

            <p>The respondents challenge the merits of the second ground of appeal observing, in particular, that the conditions of lis pendens between two cases and res judicata, such as those deriving from the case-law of the Court of Justice and the General Court are not fulfilled in the present case.</p>

            <p>In so far as the second ground of appeal is based essentially on the Commission's argument, as argued in relation to its first ground of appeal, that the demand for default interest in the contested letters is only an enforcement measure for what is already laid down in the Methacrylates decision and is not dissociable from it, it must be held that that argument, as is clear, in particular from paragraphs 44 to 52 of the present judgment, cannot be accepted.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, and to the same effect, the Court, in paragraph 89 of the order of 7 February 2012, Total and Elf Aquitaine v Commission ( C‑421/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:60), as the General Court rightly recalled in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal, dismissed as manifestly inadmissible the claim brought by the respondents in the appeal which gave rise to that order, exempting them from paying interest, having regard to the fact that it did not relate to the judgment which was the subject of that appeal and, therefore, the Methacrylates decision, but the contested letters imposing default interest.</p>
