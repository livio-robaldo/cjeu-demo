            <p>Article 5 of Directive 2004/25, headed `Protection of minority shareholders, the mandatory bid and the equitable price', provides in subparagraphs 1 to 4: `1.   Where a natural or legal person, as a result of his/her own acquisition or the acquisition by persons acting in concert with him/her, holds securities of a company as referred to in Article 1(1) which, added to any existing holdings of those securities of his/hers and the holdings of those securities of persons acting in concert with him/her, directly or indirectly give him/her a specified percentage of voting rights in that company, giving him/her control of that company, Member States shall ensure that such a person is required to make a bid as a means of protecting the minority shareholders of that company. Such a bid shall be addressed at the earliest opportunity to all the holders of those securities for all their holdings at the equitable price as defined in paragraph 4. 2.   Where control has been acquired following a voluntary bid made in accordance with this Directive to all the holders of securities for all their holdings, the obligation laid down in paragraph 1 to launch a bid shall no longer apply. 3.   The percentage of voting rights which confers control for the purposes of paragraph 1 and the method of its calculation shall be determined by the rules of the Member State in which the company has its registered office. 4.   The highest price paid for the same securities by the offeror, or by persons acting in concert with him/her, over a period, to be determined by Member States, of not less than six months and not more than 12 before the bid referred to in paragraph 1 shall be regarded as the equitable price. If, after the bid has been made public and before the offer closes for acceptance, the offeror or any person acting in concert with him/her purchases securities at a price higher than the offer price, the offeror shall increase his/her offer so that it is not less than the highest price paid for the securities so acquired. Provided that the general principles laid down in Article 3(1) are respected, Member States may authorise their supervisory authorities to adjust the price referred to in the first subparagraph in circumstances and in accordance with criteria that are clearly determined. To that end, they may draw up a list of circumstances in which the highest price may be adjusted either upwards or downwards, for example where the highest price was set by agreement between the purchaser and a seller, where the market prices of the securities in question have been manipulated, where market prices in general or certain market prices in particular have been affected by exceptional occurrences, or in order to enable a firm in difficulty to be rescued. They may also determine the criteria to be applied in such cases, for example the average market value over a particular period, the break-up value of the company or other objective valuation criteria generally used in financial analysis. Any decision by a supervisory authority to adjust the equitable price shall be substantiated and made public.'</p>

            <p>A number of actions seeking the annulment of Decision 18662 were brought before the Tribunale amministrativo regionale per il Lazio (Lazio Regional Administrative Court). In some of the actions, it was submitted that Article 106(3)(d)(2) of the TUF and Article 47 octies of the order concerning offerees were not applicable on the ground that they were contrary to Article 5(4) of Directive 2004/25.</p>

It also held that the conditions for referring a question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling were not met, since the EU law did not give rise to any doubt as to the reply to be given.</p>

In its global analysis of the interests of the various operators involved, it held that the agreement with MCI was an objective pursued by all the signatories to the Pirelli agreement who brought about the transaction to acquire Camfin, but also for all the other signatories to the agreement, who were persons objectively interested in the conclusion of a global agreement between MTP and MCI.</p>

            <p>The referring court recalls, first of all, the objectives of the provisions on the determination of the mandatory takeover bid price and sets out the principal findings in the first instance judgments. Next, it sets out the essential arguments made by the appellants in the main proceedings, that the lack of obligation of finding that there was an element of intention on the part of all those participating in the collusion conferred on the supervisory authority an unlimited degree of discretion in assessing the conduct of the offeror, the seller and third party operators on the market. According to them, that degree of discretion is incompatible with the requirement that there is certainty in the ex ante identification of the conduct relevant for the purposes of increasing the price of the takeover bid.</p>

            <p>The referring court notes that there are, in various fields of Italian law, provisions that classify certain acts of collusion in which that notion has the meaning of a `clandestine and fraudulent agreement to the detriment of third parties that circumvents mandatory statutory provisions', which presupposes that there was an element of intent on the part of all of the participants to the agreement. If that notion were applied, such as it is, to the field of law at issue in the main proceedings, the grounds of appeal would have to be upheld, since the companies which transferred their holdings in Pirelli to MCI were not parties to any clandestine or fraudulent agreement.</p>

            <p>However, the referring court observes that, within the specific field of law at issue in the main proceedings, Consob's power to make adjustments is regulatory in nature rather than penal, which precludes the simple transposition, into that field of law, of the definition of the notion of `collusion' such as it exists in other fields of Italian law. It emphasises moreover that, in competition law and regulation of the markets, the notion of a `prohibited agreement' may also be deduced from apparently independent actions by operators in cases where those actions objectively produce an effect prohibited by the law. It follows from the foregoing that, as the Tribunale amministrativo regionale per il Lazio (Lazio Regional Administrative Court) held, for the purposes of establishing collusion, it is not necessary that the authority proves that the action of the parties was intended to circumvent the law relating to takeover bids.</p>

            <p>In the same way as the parties to the main proceedings, the referring court nevertheless entertains doubts as to whether, on account of its vagueness, the notion of `collusion', as used in the TUF and the order concerning offerees, is incompatible with the principle of certainty of conditions for the power of national authorities to adjust the price of a takeover bid, laid down in the second subparagraph of Article 5(4) of Directive 2004/25. It notes that the operators on the market of a listed company could not carry out a prior evaluation of the actions to take before a takeover bid, which would have the consequence that neutral and lawful actions on the basis of an ex ante evaluation could be regarded, ex post, on the basis of a reclassification that turned exclusively on the objective effects of a more complex situation, unknown to the operators and persons involved, of collusive conduct justifying the increase of a takeover bid price.</p>

            <p>It is true that, both the principle of legal certainty and the need to secure the full implementation of directives in law and not only in fact require that all Member States reproduce the rules of the directive concerned within a clear, precise and transparent framework providing for mandatory legal provisions (judgments of 16 November 2000, Commission v Greece, C‑214/98, EU:C:2000:624, paragraph 23, and of 14 January 2010, Commission v Czech Republic, C‑343/08, EU:C:2010:14, paragraph 40).</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, those requirements cannot be regarded as requiring a norm that uses an abstract legal notion to refer to the various specific hypotheses in which it applies, given that all those hypotheses could not be determined in advance by the legislature.</p>

            <p>Therefore, the second subparagraph of Article 5(4) of Directive 2004/25 cannot be interpreted as requiring a Member State, which, in the legislation that it adopts in order to transpose that provision, provides, as in the case in the main proceedings, the `collusion between an offeror or persons acting in concert with it and one or more sellers' as being one of the clearly determined circumstances within the meaning of that provision, which sets out the specific conduct that characterises such a collusion.</p>

            <p>In the second place, the referring court asks whether the second subparagraph of Article 5(4) of that directive precludes a Member State from referring, in order to define one of the circumstances in which the equitable price may be adjusted, to the notion of `collusion', which has, in the context the law at issue in the main proceedings, a different meaning from that which it is given in other areas of national law.</p>

            <p>To the extent that that provision pursues the aim of protecting holders of securities in the company that is the object of a takeover bid, and in particular minority shareholders, enshrined in Directive 2004/25 and recalled in paragraphs 24 to 33 of this judgment, where a Member State has recourse to a notion such as that of `collusion' in order to define one of the circumstances in which the equitable price may be adjusted, the fact that that notion has a different meaning in other fields of national law does not preclude that, used in the context of the national law on takeover bids, it may be regarded as satisfying the requirements of the second subparagraph of Article 5(4) of that directive.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, in order to satisfy the requirement for legal certainty, Member States must ensure that the interpretation that must be given to such a notion in the field of takeover bids can be deduced in a sufficiently clear, precise and foreseeable manner from the national law at issue using methods of interpretation recognised by the national law.</p>

            <p>It follows from the foregoing considerations that the second subparagraph of Article 5(4) of Directive 2004/25 must be interpreted as not precluding a national law, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which enables a national supervisory authority to adjust upwards the price of a takeover bid in the event of `collusion' without setting out the specific conduct that characterises that notion, provided that the interpretation of that notion can be deduced in a sufficiently clear, precise and foreseeable manner from that law, using methods of interpretation recognised by the national law.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules: The second subparagraph of Article 5(4) of Directive 2004/25/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 on takeover bids must be interpreted as not precluding a national law, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which enables a national supervisory authority to adjust upwards the price of a takeover bid in the event of collusion without setting out the specific conduct that characterises that notion, provided that the interpretation of that notion can be deduced in a sufficiently clear, precise and foreseeable manner from that law, using methods of interpretation recognised by the national law.</p>
