            <p>That territory has been classified as an SPA for the purposes of the fourth subparagraph of Article 4(1) of the Birds Directive because it hosts the natural habitat of a species of bird identified in Annex I to that directive, namely the hen harrier. That territory, which covers 20935 hectares, includes, in particular, areas of unplanted blanket bog and heath and 12078 hectares of woodland. Due to its characteristics, the whole of this area is potentially suitable as a habitat for that species.</p>

            <p>According to the referring court, it is envisaged that the contested development will occupy 832 hectares of the SPA, essentially covered by first and second rotation plantations of conifers and unplanted bog and heath. The erection of 16 wind turbines and related infrastructure will require the clearance of trees at each wind turbine location. It is estimated that 41.7 hectares of trees will be felled. The development will result in the permanent loss of 9 hectares of habitat, corresponding to the built-on areas, and the temporary loss of 1.7 hectares of habitat, which will be used for the construction of temporary settlement ponds. Moreover, as it is assumed that foraging hen harriers will not come within 250 metres of a wind turbine, the referring court notes that this may result in the complete loss of 162.7 hectares of foraging habitat.</p>

            <p>The contested development includes a Species and Habitat Management Plan ( `the management plan'). That plan, to be implemented over a period of five years, includes measures to address the potential effects of the wind farm on the hen harrier's foraging habitat. First, the management plan envisages that three currently planted areas, covering an area of 41.2 hectares, 14.2 of which would be within 250 metres of a turbine, will be restored to blanket bog. Second, during the lifetime of the contested development, under the plan 137.3 hectares of second rotation forest will be subjected to `sensitive' management, which foresees the felling and replacing of the current closed canopy forest so as to ensure that there will be 137.3 hectares of perpetually open canopy forest providing suitable foraging habitat for the hen harrier and an ecological corridor between two areas of open bog. The felling will be done on a phased basis, starting a year prior to construction. Third, construction works will generally be confined to times outside the main hen harrier breeding season.</p>

            <p>The An Bord and the interveners in the main proceedings argue that, for the purpose of determining whether the development is likely to adversely affect the integrity of the SPA within the meaning of Article 6(3) of the Habitats Directive, it is necessary to take account of the fact that no part of the wooded sector of the area will remain permanently in a condition allowing it to provide suitable habitat.</p>

          <content eId="para_17595__content">
            <p>In that connection, the Supreme Court indicates that hen harriers are primarily birds living in open countryside which require extensive areas of suitable land over which to forage. Nesting requirements are, however, small-scale and can be met in a smaller geographical area and a variety of habitat types. Moreover, the decline in the number of the protected species is attributable more to the potential deterioration of the foraging habitat than to that of the nesting habitat. The referring court states that, while unplanted bog and heath were once generally recognised as prime hen harrier habitat, it has been observed that, as commercial forestry has become more widespread, young conifer plantations on bog provide the hen harrier with foraging opportunities. On the other hand, it is apparent from those considerations that a forest which is not thinned or harvested, but is simply left to mature, resulting in a closed canopy, will not provide suitable foraging habitat.</p>

          <num>20</num>
          <content eId="para_17596__content">
            <p>It is apparent from the documents submitted to the Court that commercial forestry has an average cycle of 40 years, which includes two rotation stages. The parts of the area in which the plantations have matured at the end of the first stage and which therefore have a closed canopy are clear-felled. This is followed by a replanting stage, as a result of which part of the area will once again be open-canopy, providing suitable territory for hen harrier foraging. It follows that the foraging habitat of this species in the SPA is in constant flux and depends on which of those stages -- which are linked to forest management -- has been reached. Thus, a failure to actively manage the forest plantation would in itself lead to loss of hen harrier foraging habitat, as a result of the gradual disappearance of parts of the open canopy area. According to the available studies, the population of this protected species can be expected to fall and rise in accordance with the availability of open canopy forest. In the present case, the amount of open canopy forest will gradually decrease from 14% of the total afforested lands over the period 2014 to 2018 to a low of 8% during the period 2024 to 2028.</p>

            <p>According to the referring court, it is required to determine whether the An Bord was incorrect to take the view that the contested development and the management plan entail mitigating elements which allow it to carry out its assessment solely on the basis of Article 6(3) of the Habitats Directive.</p>

            <p>It should be noted, first, that, although the question referred by the Supreme Court does not contain any reference to provisions of EU law, that question, which must be read in the light of the details given in the order for reference, concerns the interpretation of Article 6(3) and (4) of the Habitats Directive.</p>

The second stage, which is envisaged in the second sentence of Article 6(3) and occurs following the appropriate assessment, allows such a plan or project to be authorised only if it will not adversely affect the integrity of the site concerned, subject to the provisions of Article 6(4) of the directive (judgment of 12 April 2018, People Over Wind and Sweetman, C‑323/17, EU:C:2018:244, paragraph 29 and the case-law cited).</p>

Third, the part of the area that will not be available during the lifetime of the project could be as much as 162.7 hectares.

            <p>Lastly, it should be noted that, in accordance with Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive, in the event that, in spite of the fact that the assessment conducted in accordance with the first sentence of Article 6(3) of that directive is negative, a plan or project must nevertheless be carried out for imperative reasons of overriding public interest, including those of a social or economic nature, and where there are no alternative solutions, the Member State concerned is to take all compensatory measures necessary to ensure that `the overall coherence of Natura 2000' is protected.</p>

            <p>Therefore, in such a situation, the competent national authorities may grant an authorisation under Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive only in so far as the conditions set out therein are satisfied (judgment of 21 July 2016, Orleans and Others, C‑387/15 and C‑388/15, EU:C:2016:583, paragraph 63 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It follows that the answer to the question referred is that Article 6 of the Habitats Directive must be interpreted as meaning that, where it is intended to carry out a project on a site designated for the protection and conservation of certain species, of which the area suitable for providing for the needs of a protected species fluctuates over time, and the temporary or permanent effect of that project will be that some parts of the site will no longer be able to provide a suitable habitat for the species in question, the fact that the project includes measures to ensure that, after an appropriate assessment of the implications of the project has been carried out and throughout the lifetime of the project, the part of the site that is in fact likely to provide a suitable habitat will not be reduced and indeed may be enhanced may not be taken into account for the purpose of the assessment that must be carried out in accordance with Article 6(3) of the directive to ensure that the project in question will not adversely affect the integrity of the site concerned; that fact falls to be considered, if need be, under Article 6(4) of the directive.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules: Article 6 of Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992 on the conservation of natural habitats and of wild fauna and flora must be interpreted as meaning that, where it is intended to carry out a project on a site designated for the protection and conservation of certain species, of which the area suitable for providing for the needs of a protected species fluctuates over time, and the temporary or permanent effect of that project will be that some parts of the site will no longer be able to provide a suitable habitat for the species in question, the fact that the project includes measures to ensure that, after an appropriate assessment of the implications of the project has been carried out and throughout the lifetime of the project, the part of the site that is in fact likely to provide a suitable habitat will not be reduced and indeed may be enhanced may not be taken into account for the purpose of the assessment that must be carried out in accordance with Article 6(3) of the directive to ensure that the project in question will not adversely affect the integrity of the site concerned; that fact falls to be considered, if need be, under Article 6(4) of the directive.</p>
