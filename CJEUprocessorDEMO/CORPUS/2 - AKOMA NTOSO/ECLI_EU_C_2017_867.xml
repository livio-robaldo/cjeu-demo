            <p>The Neuss Tax Office did not accept RGEX's VAT return and, by notice dated 31 August 2010, assessed the VAT due for 2008 on the basis of the findings of two VAT inspections. The Neuss Tax Office took the view that the supplies of vehicles to Spain, which had been declared as tax-exempt, were taxable because the vehicles in question had not in fact been delivered in Spain but had been sold in Germany. It also took the view that the input tax deductions claimed on the basis of invoices issued by EXTEL were not deductible because EXTEL was a `ghost company' which did not have any establishment at the address on its invoices.</p>

            <p>The referring court notes that, under national law, RGEX is not entitled to the input tax deduction it claims on the basis of EXTEL's invoices since EXTEL does not carry out any economic activity itself at the address on its invoices. In a decision delivered in a parallel action, the referring court held that the term `full address' within the meaning of Paragraph 14(4)(1) of the UStG implies that the trader carries out its economic activities at that location. If, pursuant to an administrative instruction under national law, the tax authorities were to regard it as sufficient to count the post box or post code `in place of the address', such an instruction would not bind the courts.</p>

            <p>The Finanzgericht Köln (Finance Court, Cologne, Germany) upheld Mr Butin's action, by which he challenged the tax adjustment carried out by the Bergisch Gladbach Tax Office. According to that court, the term `address', within the meaning of Paragraph 14(4)(1) of the UStG, does not require that business activities take place there. Furthermore, that court found that the action was also well founded with regard to the claim in the alternative for an amended assessment to tax on equitable grounds. In its view, Mr Butin had done everything that could reasonably be required of him in order to verify Z's status as a trader and the accuracy of the content of the invoices issued by Z.</p>

            <p>The Bergisch Gladbach Tax Office brought an appeal against the judgment of the Finanzgericht Köln (Finance Court, Cologne) before the Bundesfinanzhof (Federal Finance Court). It submitted in particular that the invoices issued by Z did not contain, contrary to what is claimed by Mr Butin, the address at which that company carried out its business activities, and, since Mr Butin had not done everything that could reasonably be required of him in order to ensure the accuracy of the content of the invoices, he should not be granted a deduction of input tax under the equity procedure.</p>

            <p>By the first question in Case C‑374/16 and the first and second questions in Case C‑375/16, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 168(a) and Article 178(a) of the VAT Directive, read in conjunction with Article 226(5) thereof, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which makes the exercise of the right to deduct input VAT subject to the condition that the address where the issuer of an invoice carries out its economic activity must be indicated on the invoice.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, it should be recalled that, pursuant to Article 178(a) of the VAT Directive, in order to exercise the right of deduction, a taxable person must hold an invoice drawn up in accordance with Articles 220 to 236 and Articles 238 to 240 of that directive.</p>

            <p>Article 226 of that directive lists the details which must appear on such an invoice. Article 226(5) lays down, in particular, the requirement to indicate the full name and address of the taxable person and of the customer.</p>

            <p>In accordance with the case-law of the Court, in interpreting a provision of EU law, it is necessary to consider not only its wording but also the context in which it occurs and the objectives pursued by the rules of which it forms part (see, to that effect, judgments of 3 December 2009, Yaesu Europe, C‑433/08, EU:C:2009:750, paragraph 24, and of 6 July 2017, Air Berlin, C‑290/16, EU:C:2017:523, paragraph 22).</p>

            <p>In the first place, as regards the wording of Article 226(5) of the VAT Directive, it should be noted that there are differences in the various language versions of that provision. Some of the language versions of that provision, such as the versions in Spanish, English, French or Latvian, refer, respectively, to the `nombre completo y la dirección', `the full name and address', the `nom complet et l'adresse' or the `pilns vārds vai nosaukums un adrese', while other versions, in particular the versions in German or Italian, lay down a requirement to indicate the `vollständigen Namen und die vollständige Anschrift' or the `nome e l'indirizzo completo' ( `the full name and the full address').</p>

          <content eId="para_3711__content">
            <p>However, the absence or presence of the adjective `full' in the wording of that requirement does not provide guidance as to whether the address indicated on the invoice must correspond to the address where the issuer of the invoice carries out its economic activity.</p>

          <content eId="para_3712__content">
            <p>Furthermore, it should be stated that the ordinary meaning of the term `address' is broad. As the Advocate General noted in point 36 of his Opinion, the usual meaning of that term covers any type of address, including a `letterbox address', provided that the person may be contacted at that address.</p>

            <p>Moreover, Article 226 of the VAT Directive states that, without prejudice to the particular provisions of that directive, only the details mentioned in that article are required for VAT purposes on invoices issued pursuant to Article 220 of that directive (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 September 2016, Barlis 06 -- Investimentos Imobiliários e Turísticos, C‑516/14, EU:C:2016:690, paragraph 25).</p>

          <content eId="para_3716__content">
            <p>In the second place, with regard to the context of which Article 226 of the VAT Directive forms part, it should be recalled that the right to deduct VAT may not, in principle, be limited (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 September 2016, Senatex, C‑518/14, EU:C:2016:691, paragraph 37).</p>

          <content eId="para_3717__content">
            <p>The Court has held, in that regard, that holding an invoice showing the details referred to in Article 226 of the VAT Directive is a formal condition of the right to deduct VAT. The deduction of input VAT must be allowed if the substantive requirements are satisfied, even if the taxable persons have failed to comply with certain formal conditions (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 September 2016, Senatex, C‑518/14, EU:C:2016:691, paragraph 38 and the case-law cited). It follows that the detailed rules regarding the indication of the address of the issuer of the invoice cannot be a decisive condition for the purposes of the deduction of VAT.</p>

          <num>41</num>
          <content eId="para_3718__content">
            <p>In the third place, as regards the teleological interpretation of Article 226 of the VAT Directive, the purpose of the details which must be shown on an invoice is to allow the tax authorities to monitor the payment of the tax due and the existence of a right to deduct VAT (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 September 2016, Barlis 06 -- Investimentos Imobiliários e Turísticos, C‑516/14, EU:C:2016:690, paragraph 27).</p>

          <content eId="para_3719__content">
            <p>In that respect, as the Advocate General noted, in essence, in points 40 and 41 of his Opinion, the aim of indicating the address, name and VAT identification number of the issuer of the invoice is to make it possible to establish a link between a given economic transaction and a specific economic operator, namely the issuer of the invoice. The identification of the issuer of the invoice allows the tax authorities to check whether the amount of VAT giving rise to the deduction has been declared and paid. Such identification also allows the taxable person to check whether the issuer of the invoice is a taxable person for the purposes of the VAT rules.</p>

          <content eId="para_3720__content">
            <p>In that regard, it should be noted that the VAT identification number of the supplier of the goods or services is an essential piece of information in that identification. That number is easily accessible and verifiable by the tax authorities.</p>

            <p>Moreover, as the Advocate General noted in point 43 of his Opinion, in order to obtain a VAT identification number, undertakings must complete a registration process in which they are required to submit a VAT registration form, along with supporting documentation.</p>

          <num>45</num>
          <content eId="para_3722__content">
            <p>It follows that the aim of indicating the address of the issuer of the invoice, in conjunction with his name and VAT identification number, is to identify the issuer of the invoice and thus to enable the tax authorities to carry out the checks referred to in paragraph 41 above.</p>

          <content eId="para_3723__content">
            <p>In that context, it should also be pointed out that the Court has held that the deduction system is intended to relieve the trader entirely of the burden of the VAT payable or paid in the course of all its economic activities (see, inter alia, judgments of 22 October 2015, Sveda, C‑126/14, EU:C:2015:712, paragraph 17, and of 14 June 2017, Compass Contract Services, C‑38/16, EU:C:2017:454, paragraph 34). In order to achieve the objectives pursued by that system, it is not necessary to lay down an obligation to indicate the address where the issuer of the invoice carries out its economic activity.</p>

        <paragraph eId="para_3724">

          <content eId="para_3724__content">
            <p>Additionally, such an interpretation is confirmed by the judgment of 22 October 2015, PPUH Stehcemp ( C‑277/14, EU:C:2015:719), in which the Court ruled that it was possible to deduct input VAT on the basis of invoices issued by a company which a national court had found to be a non-existent trader. Even though the national court had found that the building designated in the commercial register as being the trader's seat was in a dilapidated state, the Court held that the fact that no economic activity could be carried out at that company's seat does not mean that that activity could not be conducted in places other than the company's seat (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 October 2015, PPUH Stehcemp, C‑277/14, EU:C:2015:719, paragraph 35), in particular when those activities are carried out remotely through the use of new computer technologies.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, contrary to the arguments of the German and Austrian Governments, the fact that, for the purposes of the right to deduct VAT, it is not a requirement that the economic activities of the taxable person be carried out at the address indicated on the invoice issued by that person, is not undermined by the findings of the Court in the judgment of 28 June 2007, Planzer Luxembourg ( C‑73/06, EU:C:2007:397). The analysis of the scope of the terms `business' and `fixed establishment' for the purposes of the Thirteenth Directive 86/560 is irrelevant to the issue of establishing the meaning of the term `address' in Article 226(5) of the VAT Directive.</p>
