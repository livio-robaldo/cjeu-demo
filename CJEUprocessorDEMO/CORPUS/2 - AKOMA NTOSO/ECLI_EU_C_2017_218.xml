            <p>It should be noted that Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/29 corresponds in substance to Article 11 bis(1)(ii) of the Berne Convention. Thus, when the Court interprets the concept of `communication to the public' within the meaning of Article 3(1), it does so in conformity with that convention provision, pursuant to the Court's consistent case-law (see, to that effect, judgment of 7 December 2006, SGAE, C‑306/05, EU:C:2006:764, paragraphs 40 and 41).</p>

            <p>The Court has previously held that the concept of `communication to the public', within the meaning of Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/29, includes two cumulative criteria, namely, an `act of communication' of a work and the communication of that work to a `public' (judgment of 31 May 2016, Reha Training, C‑117/15, EU:C:2016:379, paragraph 37).</p>

          <content eId="para_3994__content">
            <p>More specifically, it is evident from the Court's case-law, first, that the act of communication refers to any transmission of the protected works, irrespective of the technical means or process used, and every transmission or retransmission of a work which uses a specific technical means must, as a rule, be individually authorised by the author of the work in question (see judgment of 31 May 2016, Reha Training, C‑117/15, EU:C:2016:379, paragraph 38 and 39).</p>

            <p>Second, in order to come within the concept of `communication to the public', within the meaning of Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/29, it is also necessary that protected works be actually communicated to a `public', the term `public' being understood to mean an indeterminate number of potential recipients and, moreover, a fairly large number of persons (see judgment of 31 May 2016, Reha Training, C‑117/15, EU:C:2016:379, paragraph 40 and 41).</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the Court has already held that the transmission of protected works by a body other than that which had obtained the original authorisation of communication is a `communication to the public', within the meaning of that provision, when such works are transmitted to a new public, that is to say, to a public which was not taken into account by the authors of the protected works when they granted the original authorisation for the use of their works (see, to that effect, judgment of 31 May 2016, Reha Training, C‑117/15, EU:C:2016:379, paragraph 45 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Given that the distribution of the protected works by means of cables is carried out, as is clear from the wording of the question referred, on the national territory and that the persons concerned have therefore been taken into account by the rightholders when they granted the original authorisation for the national broadcaster to broadcast those works, the public to which Zürs.net distributes those works cannot be regarded as a new public.</p>

            <p>In the second place, the referring court expresses uncertainty as to whether national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which provides that the transmission of broadcasts by means of a communal antenna installation, to which a maximum of 500 subscribers are connected, is not regarded as being a new broadcast, is covered by Article 5 of Directive 2001/29 and, more specifically, by paragraph 3(o) thereof, and as to whether the distributors of such broadcasts transmitted by means of such antennae may therefore avoid the requirement that authorisation be obtained from the rightholder. It appears from the explanations provided by the referring court that Zürs.net may be regarded as using a `small communal antenna installation' within the meaning of that national legislation.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be recalled, first of all, that, as the Court has pointed out in paragraph 25 of the present judgment, the transmission of protected works by a body other than that which had obtained the original authorisation of communication is a `communication to the public', within the meaning of that provision, when such works are transmitted to a new public, that is to say, to a public which was not taken into account by the rightholders concerned when they granted the original authorisation for the use of their works.</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is clear from the order for reference that Zürs.net's `small communal antenna installation' enables, in addition to the ORF broadcasts, the broadcasts of other broadcasters established in other Member States to be transmitted, with the result that such transmissions may be regarded as communications to the public within the meaning of Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/29. It is for the national court to carry out the necessary determinations in that regard.</p>

            <p>In the case in the main proceedings, the case file submitted to the Court states that the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings permits economic operators to pursue an activity broadcasting protected works by means of communal antennae installations, without an obligation, inter alia, to seek authorisation from the authors of those works in accordance with the right of communication to the public which those authors hold, on condition that the number of subscribers connected to such an antenna is no more than 500.</p>

            <p>That option, set out in the legislation, is likely to attract economic operators wishing to take advantage of it, and to lead to the continuous and parallel use of a multiplicity of communal antenna installations.

            <p>The Court has already held that the criteria of the cumulative number of potential audiences with access to the same work at the same time is an important element in the concept of the `public' and, consequently, a relevant element in communication to the public that is subject to the requirement that authorisation be obtained from the rightholder concerned (see, to that effect, judgment of 31 May 2016, Reha Training, C‑117/15, EU:C:2016:379, paragraphs 42 to 44).</p>
