            <p>The dispute in the main proceedings concerns the allocation of new digital broadcasting radio frequencies which were freed up following the transition from analogue to digital television ( `the digital switchover'). Digital technology is characterised by transmission efficiency superior to that of analogue technology in so far as, in contrast to the latter, the former allows several programmes to be broadcast simultaneously on the same radio frequency. The radio frequencies thereby freed up form the `digital dividend'.</p>

            <p>The digital switchover began in Italy at a time when proceedings for a declaration of failure to fulfil obligations were pending against that Member State since 2006 with regard to the compatibility of the Italian legislation on the management of radio frequencies for television broadcasting, the digital switchover and the allocation of digital radio frequencies with the provisions of the Framework, Authorisation and Competition Directives. In its reasoned opinion of 19 July 2007, the European Commission, in essence, stated that, in guaranteeing access to the digital radio and television market only to operators already actively using analogue technology, that legislation protected those operators from competition in that market. The Italian Government adopted several measures in order to bring that legislation into line with EU law.</p>

That latter condition requires that those criteria be appropriate for securing attainment of the objective pursued and do not go beyond what is necessary for attaining it (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 April 2015, Commission v Bulgaria, C‑376/13, not published, EU:C:2015:266, paragraphs 65 and 84).</p>

The Member States therefore enjoy, in accordance with the objectives and obligations laid down by the Framework Directive and the specific directives, unfettered discretion as to the establishment of competitive or comparative procedures, whether they be free of charge or fee-based. Second, it must be held that, in the light of the need to ensure the effective management of radio frequencies and of their important social, cultural and economic value, which the Member States must take into account under Article 9(1) of the Framework Directive, and of the spectrum scarcity of those radio frequencies, a fee-based allocation may prove justified.</p>

The comparability of situations must be assessed in particular in the light of the subject matter and purpose of the measure in question. The principles and objectives of the field to which that measure relates must also be taken into account (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 December 2008, Arcelor Atlantique et Lorraine and Others, C‑127/07, EU:C:2008:728, paragraph 26 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the present case, it should be noted, first, that it has been indicated to the Court that the digital radio frequencies were allocated free of charge to incumbents so as, depending on the circumstances, to ensure the continuity of television output or to reward investment already made in digital technology, whereas the radio frequencies of the digital dividend, aimed, in particular, at new entrants and small operators, were subject to a fee-based selection procedure. However, as the Advocate General noted in point 87 of her Opinion, in the light of the objectives thus set out, those two categories of operator are not, in principle, in a comparable situation, so that a potential difference in treatment is not contrary to the principle of equal treatment.</p>

            <p>Second, it is to be noted that the principle of equal treatment also does not preclude a Member State, which previously allocated radio frequencies free of charge, from subjecting the allocation of new digital radio frequencies to a fee-based selection procedure. Given the technological differences characterising, on the one hand, analogue radio frequencies and, on the other, digital radio frequencies, the principle of equality of treatment does not require that they be treated identically for the purpose of their allocation.</p>

            <p>In the second place, it should be noted that, where the granting of rights of use for radio frequencies needs to be reduced, Article 7(3) of the Authorisation Directive provides that the Member States are to grant such rights on the basis of selection criteria which must be objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate. Such criteria must, in addition, give due weight to the achievement of the objectives of Article 8 of the Framework Directive and of the requirements of Article 9 thereof. In that regard, it is clear from recital 11 of the Authorisation Directive that those rights of use should not be reduced, except where this is unavoidable in view of the scarcity of radio frequencies and the need to ensure their efficient use.</p>

            <p>As the Advocate General stated in point 95 of her Opinion, such considerations may, in principle, justify a reduction in the number of radio frequencies put out to tender in accordance with the conditions set out in paragraph 73 above.</p>

            <p>However, it is for the referring court to ascertain whether, as certain parties have submitted before the Court, the analogue television incumbents were favoured in the digital switchover through the allocation of a number of radio frequencies greater than that which was necessary for continuing their programmes, whereas the reduction in the number of radio frequencies affected the radio frequencies put out to tender for new operators.</p>

            <p>In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the third and fourth questions is that Article 9 of the Framework Directive, Articles 3, 5 and 7 of the Authorisation Directive and Articles 2 and 4 of the Competition Directive must be interpreted as not precluding a selection procedure free of charge for the allocation of radio frequencies, which has been commenced in order to remedy the unlawful exclusion of certain operators from the market, from being replaced by a fees-based procedure commenced under an amended Radio Frequency Allocation Plan after to a reduction in their number, provided that the new selection procedure is based on objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate criteria and that it is in line with the objectives laid down in Article 8(2) to (4) of the Framework Directive. It is for the referring court to ascertain, taking into account all the relevant circumstances of the case, whether the conditions set out in the fee-based selection procedure are such as to allow an actual entry of new entrants into the digital television market without unduly favouring analogue or digital incumbents.</p>

              <p>The fifth question</p>
            </tblock>
            <p>78 By its fifth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the principle of legitimate expectations must be interpreted as precluding the discontinuance of a selection procedure for the allocation of radio frequencies on the sole ground that operators, such as the applicants in the main proceedings, which had been invited to tender and, as the only tenderers, would have been granted rights to use digital terrestrial broadcasting frequencies for radio and television had the procedure not been annulled.</p>

            <p>According to settled case-law of the Court, the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations is one of the fundamental principles of the European Union (judgment of 14 March 2013, Agrargenossenschaft Neuzelle, C‑545/11, EU:C:2013:169, paragraph 23 and the case-law cited) and must be observed not only by the EU institutions, but also by Member States in the exercise of the powers conferred on them under EU directives (judgment of 9 July 2015, Salomie and Oltean, C‑183/14, EU:C:2015:454, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>The right to rely on that principle extends to any person in a situation in which an administrative authority has caused that person to entertain expectations which are justified by precise assurances provided to him (judgment of 9 July 2015, Salomie and Oltean, C‑183/14, EU:C:2015:454, paragraph 44 and the case-law cited). In whatever form it is given, information which is precise, unconditional and consistent and comes from authorised and reliable sources constitutes assurances capable of giving rise to such expectations (judgment of 17 March 2011, AJD Tuna, C‑221/09, EU:C:2011:153, paragraph 72 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is clear from the documents provided to the Court that the applicants in the main proceedings participated in the `beauty contest'. They base their argument on the fact that, as the only tenderers for certain multiplexes, they had to have been awarded at least one multiplex each. It is, however, common ground that, during that procedure, no radio frequency was awarded to them. Subject to verification by the referring court, it also does not appear from the documents in the case file that they had been given precise, unconditional assurances as to the future allocation of the multiplexes in question.</p>

            <p>However, failing any precise assurances originating from an authorised reliable source, the mere fact that an operator is invited to tender for the allocation of digital radio frequencies, such as the `beauty contest' at issue in the main proceedings, is not capable of leading him to entertain reasonable expectations. That is the case even in a situation where the operator participates in the procedure as the sole tenderer for the award of a multiplex.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 3(3a) of Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive), as amended by Directive 2009/140/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009, must be interpreted as precluding the annulment, by a national legislature, of an on-going selection procedure for the allocation of radio frequencies conducted by the competent national regulatory authority in circumstances such as those of the case in the main proceedings which was suspended by ministerial order. 2. Article 9 of Directive 2002/21, as amended by Directive 2009/140, Articles 3, 5 and 7 of Directive 2002/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive), as amended by Directive 2009/140, and Articles 2 and 4 of Commission Directive 2002/77/EC of 16 September 2002 on competition in the markets for electronic communications networks and services, must be interpreted as not precluding a selection procedure for the allocation of radio frequencies free of charge, which was commenced in order to remedy the unlawful exclusion of certain operators from the market, from being replaced by a fees-based procedure initiated under an amended Radio Frequency Allocation Plan subsequent to a reduction in their number, provided that the new selection procedure is based on objective, transparent, non-discriminatory and proportionate criteria and that it is in line with the objectives laid down in Article 8(2) to (4) of Directive 2002/21, as amended. It is for the referring court to ascertain, taking into account all the relevant circumstances of the case, whether the conditions set out in the fee-based selection procedure are such as to allow an actual entry of new entrants into the digital television market without unduly favouring analogue or digital incumbents. 3. The principle of legitimate expectations must be interpreted as not precluding the annulment of a selection procedure for the allocation of radio frequencies on the sole ground that operators, such as the applicants in the main proceedings, had been invited to tender and, as the only tenderers, would have been granted rights to use digital terrestrial broadcasting frequencies for radio and television had the procedure not been annulled.</p>
