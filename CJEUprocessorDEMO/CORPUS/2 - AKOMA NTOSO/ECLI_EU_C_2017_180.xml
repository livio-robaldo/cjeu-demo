            <p>By two decisions of 20 November 2012, the rechtbank van eerste aanleg te Brussel (Court of First Instance, Brussels) held that no advance tax on investment income was due on the dividends paid in 1999 and 2000, pursuant to Directive 90/435 and Article 106(5) of the RD/ITC 1992.</p>

            <p>The Belgian State brought an appeal against those decisions before the referring court, claiming, inter alia, that the recipients of the dividends are Netherlands fiscal investment institutions ( `FIIs') which are subject to corporation tax in the Netherlands at a zero rate, and are not eligible for the exemption from advance tax on income from investments provided for in Article 106(5) of the RD/ITC 1992 and Article 5 of Directive 90/435, since they do not fulfil the condition of being liable to tax referred to in Article 2(c) of that directive and Article 106(5) of the RD/ITC 1992.</p>

            <p>The Belgian State submits that the words `subject to [tax], without the possibility of an option or of being exempt', for the purposes of Article 2(c) of Directive 90/435, imply that the reference is to `a subjective and an objective' liability to tax. Thus, companies which are liable to corporation tax at a zero rate do not fall under that directive.</p>

            <p>Wereldhave Belgium, Wereldhave International and Wereldhave, by contrast, argue that, as a rule, FIIs are taxable in the Netherlands as public limited companies under the Wet op de vennootschapsbelasting 1969 (Corporate Tax Law 1969, `the Wet Vpb'), according to Article 1 of the Wet Vpb. That tax liability is sufficient for eligibility for exemption from advance tax on investment income pursuant to Article 266 of the ITC 1992, Article 106(5) of the RD/ITC 1992 and Article 5 of Directive 90/435. It is true that an FII may be entitled to a zero rate of corporation tax, provided that it pays all its profits to its shareholders, in accordance with Article 28 of the Wet Vpb and Article 9 of the besluit houdende vaststelling van het besluit beleggingsinstellingen (Decree establishing the Decree on Investment Institutions) of 29 April 1970. However, the requirement for it to be liable for tax, according to the defendants in the main proceedings, does not necessitate actual payment of the tax, as that liability may simply be subjective.</p>

That directive thus seeks to ensure the neutrality, from the tax point of view, of the distribution of profits by a subsidiary established in one Member State to its parent company established in another Member State (judgment of 1 October 2009, Gaz de France -- Berliner Investissement, C‑247/08, EU:C:2009:600, paragraph 27 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Secondly, Article 5(1) of Directive 90/435 provides for exemption in the State of the subsidiary from withholding tax upon distribution of profits to its parent company, at least where the latter holds a minimum of 25% of the capital of the subsidiary (judgment of 3 April 2008, Banque Fédérative du Crédit Mutuel, C‑27/07, EU:C:2008:195, paragraph 26 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>According to settled case-law, in the context of the cooperation between the Court of Justice and national courts, instituted by Article 267 TFEU, the need to provide an interpretation of EU law which can be of use to the referring court makes it necessary for that court to define the factual and legislative context of the questions referred or, at the very least, to explain the factual circumstances on which those questions are based. The Court of Justice is empowered to rule on the interpretation or validity of EU provisions only on the basis of the facts which the national court puts before it (order of 3 September 2015, Vivium, C‑250/15, not published, EU:C:2015:569, paragraph 8 and the case-law cited).</p>
