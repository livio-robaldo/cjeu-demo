In particular, the annex contains the following provisions: `2.1.10.1 A Contracting State, having issued pilot licences, shall not permit the holders thereof to act as pilot-in-command of an aircraft engaged in international commercial air transport operations if the licence holders have attained their 60th birthday or, in the case of operations with more than one pilot where the other pilot is younger than 60 years of age, their 65th birthday. 2.1.10.2 Recommendation -- A Contracting State, having issued pilot licences, should not permit the holders thereof to act as co-pilot of an aircraft engaged in international commercial air transport operations if the licence holders have attained their 65th birthday.'</p>

            <p>In this respect, the referring court notes that, according to the national legislation, the employer is `in default' if he does not, in an employment contract capable of fulfilment, accept the performance duly offered to him by the employee. In such a case, although the employee is not working, he may demand from the employer the remuneration that he would have received if the employer had accepted the performance of the work within the period of default. However, the employer's default in acceptance of the offer to perform work is excluded if the employee is not in a position to perform it. If it is impossible for the employee to perform, in whole or in part, the obligation agreed in the employment contract, the employer is required to provide the employee with other work that he is capable of performing. The employer may be required to pay damages if it fails to perform that obligation.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Consideration of the first and second questions has revealed nothing that might affect the validity of point FCL.065(b) in Annex I to Commission Regulation (EU) No 1178/2011 of 3 November 2011 laying down technical requirements and administrative procedures related to civil aviation aircrew pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 216/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council, in the light of Article 15(1) and Article 21(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. 2. Point FCL.065(b) in Annex I to Regulation No 1178/2011 must be interpreted as prohibiting the holder of a pilot's licence who has attained the age of 65 neither from acting as a pilot in ferry flights, operated by an air carrier carrying no passengers, cargo or mail, nor from working as an instructor and/or examiner on board an aircraft, without being part of the flight crew.</p>
