            <p>The Croatian and Spanish Governments submit that an affirmative answer should be given to that question. The terms `court' and `court proceedings' used in that regulation cover not only courts in the strict sense, but also, in general, any authority where it exercises an essentially judicial function, which is the case here. For its part, the European Commission submits that the answer to that question should be in the negative.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, it should be recalled that, according to settled case-law of the Court of Justice, the need for a uniform application of EU law and the principle of equality require that the wording of a provision of EU law which does not expressly refer to the law of Member States in order for its meaning and scope to be determined must normally be given an independent and uniform interpretation throughout the European Union; that interpretation must take into account the context of the provision and the objective pursued by the relevant legislation (see judgment of 13 October 2016, Mikołajczyk, C‑294/15, EU:C:2016:772, paragraph 44 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>As regards the scheme of Regulation No 805/2004, it should be observed that, although that regulation makes several references to the concepts of `court' and `court proceedings', it does not specify the constituent elements thereof. Thus, Article 4(6) of that regulation defines the concept of `court of origin' as `the court or tribunal seised of the proceedings at the time of fulfilment of the conditions set out in Article 3(1)(a), (b) or (c)'. Article 4(1) of that regulation defines the concept of `judgment' as `any judgment given by a court or tribunal of a Member State'.</p>

            <p>The preservation of the principle of legitimate expectations, in a context of the free circulation of judgments as noted in paragraphs 38 and 39 of this judgment, requires a strict assessment of the defining elements of the concept of `court', for the purposes of that regulation, in order to enable the national authorities to identify judgments delivered by other Member States' courts. Compliance with the principle of mutual trust in the administration of justice in the Member States of the European Union which underlies that regulation requires, in particular, that judgments the enforcement of which is sought in a Member State other than that of the Member State of origin have been delivered in court proceedings offering guarantees of independence and impartiality and of compliance with the principle of audi alteram partem.</p>

            <p>In the present case, it should be noted that, pursuant to the provisions of the Law on Enforcement, in Croatia, notaries have the power to give decisions by writ on applications for enforcement based on authentic documents. Once the writ has been served on the defendant, the latter may lodge objections. A notary before whom an admissible, well-founded opposition to a writ issued by that notary is raised in timely fashion is to transfer the file to the court with jurisdiction and the court must take a decision on the opposition.</p>

            <p>In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the second and third parts of the question is that Regulation No 805/2004 must be interpreted as meaning that a writ of execution adopted by a notary, in Croatia, based on an `authentic document', and which has not been contested may not be certified as a European Enforcement Order since it does not relate to an uncontested claim within the meaning of Article 3(1) of that regulation.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Regulation (EC) No 805/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 creating a European Enforcement Order for uncontested claims must be interpreted as meaning that, in Croatia, notaries, acting within the framework of the powers conferred on them by national law in enforcement proceedings based on an `authentic document', do not fall within the concept of `court' within the meaning of that regulation. 2. Regulation No 805/2004 must be interpreted as meaning that a writ of execution adopted by a notary, in Croatia, based on an `authentic document', and which has not been contested may not be certified as a European Enforcement Order since it does not relate to an uncontested claim within the meaning of Article 3(1) of that regulation.</p>
