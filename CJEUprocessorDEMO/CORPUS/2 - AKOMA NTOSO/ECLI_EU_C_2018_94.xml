            <p>As regards the argument put forward by the Republic of Poland, as set out in paragraph 37 of the present judgment, it follows from settled case-law that the question whether a Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations must be determined on the basis of the position in which the Member State found itself on the expiry of the deadline laid down in the reasoned opinion, and that any subsequent changes cannot be taken into account (see, inter alia, judgment of 27 November 1990, Commission v Greece, C‑200/88, EU:C:1990:422, paragraph 13).</p>

It also claims that the obligations imposed by that provision are not subject to an annual evaluation and that, consequently, the second complaint does not merely concern certain years during which the failure occurred, but a general failure to meet the obligations laid down in that provision.</p>

            <p>According to settled case-law, transposing a directive into national law does not necessarily require its provisions to be copied verbatim in express, specific law or regulation; a general legal context may be sufficient, provided that it does effectively ensure the full application of the directive in a sufficiently clear and precise manner (judgment of 30 June 2016, Commission v Poland, C‑648/13, EU:C:2016:490, paragraph 73 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In that regard, first, as the Commission's first three complaints have been upheld, the view must be taken that the Republic of Poland does not ensure the full application of Directive 2008/50.
