            <p>The General Court summarised the background to the case in paragraphs 1 to 8 of the judgment under appeal as follows: `1 In order to enable Italian milk producers to pay the additional levy of EUR 1386475000 owed to the European Union for exceeding the milk quota allocated to the Italian Republic during the period 1995/1996 to 2001/2002, the Italian Republic sought authorisation from the Council of the European Union to establish a State aid scheme pursuant to the third subparagraph of Article 88(2) EC.</p>

          <content eId="para_1657__content">
            <p>By Decision 2003/530/EC of 16 July 2003 on the compatibility with the common market of an aid that the Italian Republic intends to grant to its milk producers ( OJ 2003 L 184, p. 15, ``the Council decision ''), the Council authorised that Member State to ``itself mak[e] payment to the [European Union] of the amount due from them to the [European Union] by virtue of the additional levy on milk and milk products for the period 1995/1996 to 2001/2002 '' (Article 1 of the Council decision). The Council also authorised it to ``[allow the interested parties] to repay their debt [in relation to the Italian Republic] by way of deferred payment over a number of years without interest '' (Article 1 of the Council decision).</p>

          <content eId="para_1658__content">
            <p>That statement of compatibility was subject to two sets of conditions. In the first place, the Council required the Italian authorities, first, to declare the amount corresponding to the additional levy owed by the milk producers to the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) and, secondly, to deduct their outstanding debt to the European Union and the interest thereon from the expenditure financed by the EAGGF (Article 2 of the Council decision). In the second place, it required the milk producers to repay in full their debt to the Italian Republic in yearly instalments of equal size and to do so over a period not exceeding 14 years starting from 1 January 2004 (Article 1 of the Council decision).</p>

          <content eId="para_1659__content">
            <p>In that context, the Italian authorities adopted decreto-legge n. 49, riforma della normativa in tema di applicazione del prelievo supplementare nel settore del latte e dei prodotti lattiero-caseari (Decree-law No 49 reforming the rules on the application of the additional levy in the milk and dairy products sector) of 28 March 2003 (GURI No 75 of 31 March 2003, p. 4), and decreto ministeriale del 30 luglio 2003, disposizioni per il versamento del prelievo supplementare, dovuto e non versato per i periodi dal 1995/1996 al 2001/2002 di cui all `art. 10, comma 34, della legge n. 119/2003 (Ministerial Decree of 30 July 2003 on payment of the additional levy which is payable but unpaid for the period 1995/1996 to 2001/2002 and referred to in Article 10(34) of Law No 119/2003) (GURI No 183 of 8 August 2003, p. 33). The combined provisions of those two measures provided, in essence, that the amount of the additional levy borne by the Italian Republic would be fully repaid to it by the milk producers, without interest, in the form of annual payment instalments of the same amount deferred over a period not exceeding 14 years ( ``the system of staggered payments '').</p>

            <p>Having amended those provisions on several occasions ..., the Italian authorities adopted legge n. 10, Conversione in legge, con modificazioni, del decreto-legge 29 dicembre 2010, n. 225, recante proroga di termini previsti da disposizioni legislative e di interventi urgenti in materia tributaria e di sostegno alle imprese e alle famiglie (Law No 10, converting into law, with amendments, Decree-Law No 225 of 29 December 2010, extending time-limits laid down by legislative provisions and urgent interventions in tax matters and to support undertakings and families) of 26 February 2011 (GURI No 47 of 26 February 2011, Ordinary Supplement No 53), which entered into force the following day. The latter, in particular, inserted Article 1(12)k into Decree-Law No 225, which provided that, ``[i]n order to address the serious crisis affecting the dairy sector, the time-limits for payment of the amounts due on 31 December 2010 referred to in the instalment plans laid down by Decree-Law No 49 [and the subsequent legislation] have been extended until 30 June 2011 '' ( ``the deferral of payment '').</p>

            <p>By Decision C(2011) 10055 final of 11 January 2012 on State aid SA.33726 (11/C) (ex SA.33726 (11/NN)) -- Deferral of payment of the milk levy in Italy, a summary of which was published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 10 February 2012 ( OJ 2012 C 37, p. 30), the Commission initiated the procedure laid down in Article 108(2) TFEU. In the first place, it indicated, in essence, that it had doubts relating to the classification of the deferral of payment in the light of Article 107 TFEU, and to the compatibility of that measure with the internal market. In the second place, the Commission stated that that deferral of payment gave rise to an infringement of one of the conditions laid down in the Council decision, that that infringement transformed the whole system of staggered payments established by the Italian authorities into new aid, in so far as it related to milk producers who had benefited from the deferral of payment, and that the compatibility of that new aid with the internal market had also not been established.</p>

            <p>By [the decision at issue], the Commission considered, following the exchange with the Italian authorities during the administrative procedure, that each of the two measures at issue, namely, the deferral of payment, on the one hand, and the system of staggered payments, on the other hand, constituted new and unlawful aid which was incompatible with the internal market (Article 1 of the [decision at issue]). It therefore ordered the Italian Republic to ensure the immediate and effective recovery of the sums granted to milk producers who had benefited from the deferral of payment, together with interest (Articles 2 and 3 of the [decision at issue]).'</p>

            <p>By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 30 September 2013, the Italian Republic brought an action, principally, for the total annulment of the decision at issue. In the alternative, it sought the partial annulment of that decision in so far as the Commission, by that decision, requires the Italian Republic to recover the individual aid granted, in accordance with the aid scheme previously authorised by the Council decision, to the Italian milk producers who benefited from a deferral of payment.</p>

The first ground of appeal alleges infringement of the rule prohibiting the General Court from raising of its own motion a plea relating to the substantive legality of the decision at issue. The second ground of appeal alleges infringement of Article 108 TFEU and Article 1 of Regulation No 659/1999 concerning the definitions of `new aid' and `existing aid'. By its third ground of appeal, the Commission alleges an infringement of Article 108 TFEU and Articles 4, 6, 7, 14 and 16 of Regulation No 659/1999 concerning the procedures applicable to new aid and misused aid.</p>

            <p>By its first ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court ruled ultra petita, and infringed the principle that a court must rule on the issues submitted to it, Article 21 of the Protocol of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and Article 44(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court by raising of its own motion a plea relating to the substantive legality of the decision at issue. It submits that, in paragraphs 39 to 44 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court, by defining the scope of the second ground of appeal raised before it, reclassified that ground. It thus examined of its own motion the issue whether the system of staggered payments had to be classified as existing aid and not new aid owing to the allegedly insubstantial nature of the alteration made to it by the Italian authorities, which led it to annul in part the decision at issue. In the originating application that issue was raised by that Member State only in relation to the alleged infringement of Article 4(1) of Regulation No 794/2004.</p>

Moreover, the complaint concerning the infringement of that provision is formulated differently from the one concerning the infringement of Article 4(1) of Regulation No 794/2004 and the failure to state adequate reasons.</p>

            <p>In addition, in paragraphs 54 to 56 of the originating application, the Italian Republic claimed that the withdrawal of the aid resulting from the deferral of payment, in itself, is equivalent to the consequence laid down in the TFEU in the event of a finding that that aid is unlawful, and therefore should not also lead to the withdrawal of aid legally granted beforehand under the system of staggered payments. In paragraph 56 of its application, it claimed, in that regard, that `there is no evidence capable of establishing that the beneficiaries of the existing aid who benefited from the measure at issue are required to repay not only the amount corresponding to the measure at issue, but also that received as part of the existing aid (and therefore, on the basis of the authorisation decision, the interest unpaid on the first staggered payment)'.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, in paragraph 57 of that application, the Italian Republic argued: `Nor is it possible to take the view that the recovery decision may be extended to existing aid as a result of a substantial alteration to that aid which is capable of resulting in those two measures being regarded as a single new aid, not notified to the Commission and therefore unlawful'. Such a finding, in its opinion, would be `the clear result of a distortion of the concept of ``alteration of existing aid '', relevant for the application of Article 1(c) of Regulation No 659/1999', as is apparent from the first sentence of paragraph 58 of that application.</p>

            <p>By the first part of its second ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court erred in law in its interpretation of the concepts of `new aid' and `existing aid'. Essentially, it challenges the General Court's assessment, in paragraphs 74 to 91 of the judgment under appeal, that the system of staggered payments, which constitutes an existing aid scheme, having been granted conditional authorisation from the Council and having subsequently been altered in breach of the authorisation conditions for that system, must be regarded as an existing aid scheme and not as a new aid scheme, on the ground that the Commission did not establish that that alteration affects the actual substance of the pre-existing measure.</p>

            <p>The Italian Republic contends that the General Court correctly required the Commission, for the purposes of reclassifying the existing aid as new aid, to provide evidence that the infringement of the authorisation conditions for the existing aid scheme constitutes a substantial alteration to that scheme, which, in the opinion of that Member State, must be assessed having regard to Article 4(1) of Regulation No 794/2004. It is apparent from the case-law that it is only where the alteration made to existing aid is not clearly severable from the original aid scheme and that alteration also affects the actual substance of that original scheme that the latter is transformed into a new aid scheme (judgment of the Court of Justice of 9 October 1984, Heineken Brouwerijen, 91/83 and 127/83, EU:C:1984:307, paragraphs 21 and 22, and judgment of the General Court of 30 April 2002, Government of Gibraltar v Commission, T‑195/01 and T‑207/01, EU:T:2002:111). Furthermore, it follows from the case-law of the Court of Justice that the criteria laid down by case-law also apply where the alteration constitutes an infringement of the authorisation conditions for an existing aid scheme (judgment of 13 June 2013, HGA and Others v Commission, C‑630/11 P to C‑633/11 P, EU:C:2013:387, paragraphs 91, 94 and 95).</p>

            <p>In that regard, the Italian Republic argues that, if existing aid may, as a result of alterations, be reclassified as new aid where those alterations have not affected the actual substance of the existing aid, that would lead to the nature of the procedure for reviewing State aid being transformed, which would therefore take on the characteristics of a penalty.</p>

            <p>In that regard, the General Court stated, in paragraphs 69 and 70 of that judgment, that `since the infringement attributed to the Italian Republic consisted in the granting of a measure likely to be classified as new aid, the Commission was entitled to use [that procedure] ... in order to examine that measure, as it decided to do in the present case', but `had to comply, in that context, with the substantive conditions enabling it to classify not only the deferral of payment taken in isolation but also the whole of the pre-existing system of staggered payments as aid or as an aid scheme which is new and unlawful'.</p>

It added that, `in the event that the Member Sate concerned submits, during the administrative procedure, either that that alteration is clearly severable from the pre-existing measure, or that it is purely formal or administrative in character and is not capable of influencing the assessment of the compatibility of that measure with the internal market, the Commission must justify why [the arguments of that Member State] appear to it to be unfounded'.</p>

In doing so, it rejected, in paragraphs 83 to 91 of that judgment, the arguments put forward by the Commission to show that the failure by the Italian authorities to comply with one of the conditions in the declaration of compatibility adopted by the Council entailed, in essence, the reclassification of the existing aid scheme as new and unlawful aid.</p>

            <p>In doing so, the General Court misconstrued the concept of `new aid', within the meaning of Article 1(c) of Regulation No 659/1999, and therefore committed an error of law. As is apparent from paragraphs 46 to 52 above and as was observed, in essence, by the Advocate General in point 76 of his Opinion, existing aid which has been altered in breach of the compatibility conditions imposed by the Commission or the Council can no longer be regarded as authorised and, as a result, loses the status of existing aid in its entirety.</p>

            <p>Therefore, the General Court, having held, in paragraphs 81 and 82 of the judgment under appeal, after examining the grounds of the decision at issue in paragraphs 77 to 80 of that judgment, that `the Commission [had] not only misconstrued the concept of ``new aid '' by reclassifying an existing aid scheme as new unlawful aid without complying with the substantive conditions laid down in Regulation No 659/1999 and the case-law on that subject', but `also, and consequently, wrongly ordered the recovery, from the milk producers who benefited from the deferral of payment, ... the individual aid granted ... under that existing aid scheme' committed another error of law.</p>

            <p>Since the Commission has applied for costs and the Italian Republic has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by the Commission relating to the appeal proceedings. Furthermore, since the Italian Republic's action before the General Court has been dismissed in its entirety, it must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by the Commission in the proceedings at first instance. On those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby: 1. Sets aside paragraphs 1, 2 and 4 of the operative part of the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 24 June 2015, Italy v Commission (T‑527/13,EU:T:2015:429); 2.[As rectified by order of 21 November 2017] Dismisses the action brought by the Italian Republic before the General Court in Case T‑527/13; 3.
