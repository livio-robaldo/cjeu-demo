            <p>By its three questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks essentially whether Article 78(2) and Annex VII, Part III, to Regulation No 1308/2013 must be interpreted as meaning that they preclude the use of the term `milk' and the designations that the regulation reserves exclusively for milk products being used to designate a purely plant-based product in marketing or advertising even if those terms are expanded upon by clarifying or descriptive terms indicating the plant-based origin of the products concerned.</p>

            <p>Part III of Annex VII relates to milk and milk products. As regards milk, Part III, point 1, first subparagraph, states that the term `milk' means `exclusively the normal mammary secretion obtained from one or more milkings without either addition thereto or extraction therefrom'. However, the second subparagraph states, in point (a), that the term `milk' may be used for `milk treated without altering its composition or for milk the fat content of which is standardised ... and</p>

            <p>Thus, it is clear from the wording of point 1 that the term `milk' cannot, in principle, be lawfully used to designate a purely plant-based product, since milk is, within the meaning of that provision, `an animal product', which is also clear from Annex VII, Part III, point 4, to Regulation No 1308/2013, which provides that, as regards milk, the animal species from which the milk originates are to be stated, if it is not bovine, and Article 78(5) of that regulation, which empowers the Commission to adopt delegated acts to specify the milk products in respect of which the animal species from which the milk originates is to be stated, if it is not bovine.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, it is clear from that wording that clarifying or descriptive terms indicating the plant-based origin of the product concerned, such as soya or tofu, at issue in the main proceedings, do not fall within the terms which may be used with the designation `milk,' in accordance with point 1, second subparagraph (b), since the alterations to the composition of milk that the additional words may designate under that provision are those which are limited to the addition and/or subtraction of its natural constituents, which does not include a total replacement of milk by a purely plant-based product.</p>

            <p>As regards milk products, Annex VII, Part III, paragraph 2, to Regulation No 1308/2013 states in its first subparagraph that `milk products' means `products derived exclusively from milk, on the understanding that substances necessary for their manufacture may be added provided that those substances are not used for the purpose of replacing, in whole or in part, any milk constituent'. The second subparagraph of that point further states that, fist, the names used at all stages of marketing listed in point (a) of that provision including `whey', `cream', `butter', `buttermilk' and, second, in particular, names within the meaning of Article 17 of Regulation No 1169/2011 `actually used for milk products' are reserved `exclusively for milk products'.</p>

            <p>Therefore, it is clear from point 2 that since a `milk product' is derived exclusively from milk, it must contain its constituents. In that connection, the Court has already held that a milk product, in which one or other constituent of milk has been replaced, if only partially, may not be designated by one of the descriptions referred to in the point (a) of the second subparagraph of point 2 of Part III of Annex VII to Regulation No 1308/2013 (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 December 1999, UDL, C‑101/98, EU:C:1999:615, paragraphs 20 to 22). In principle, the same applies a fortiori for a purely plant-based product, of such product does not, by definition, contain any constituents of milk.</p>

In that connection, it is clear, essentially, from recital 3 of Decision 2010/791, that the list drawn up by that decision contains products which have been identified by the Member States as meeting the criteria laid down in Annex VII, Part III, point 5, second subparagraph, to Regulation No 1308/2013, and that the names of the products at issue are listed according to their traditional use in the various languages of the Union.

Likewise, although the use of the term `creamed' with the designation of a plant-based product is permitted, that is only where the term `creamed' designates the characteristic texture of the product'.</p>

Those provisions, in so far as they provide that only the products which comply with the requirements they lay down can be designated by the term `milk' and the designations reserved exclusively for milk products even if those designations are expanded upon by explanations or descriptions such as those at issue in the main proceedings, contribute to the attainment of those objectives.</p>

            <p>Each sector of the common organisation of markets for agricultural products established by that regulation embodies features specific to it. As a result, a comparison of the technical rules and procedures adopted in order to regulate the various sectors of the market cannot constitute a valid basis for the purpose of proving the complaint of discrimination between dissimilar products which are subject to different rules. (see, to that effect, judgments of 28 October 1982, Lion and Others, 292/81 and 293/81, EU:C:1982:375, paragraph 24, and of 30 June 2016, Lidl, C‑134/15, EU:C:2016:498, paragraph 49).</p>

            <p>Having regard to all of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the questions referred is that Article 78(2) and Annex VII, Part III, to Regulation No 1308/2013 must be interpreted as precluding the term `milk' and the designations reserved by that regulation exclusively for milk products from being used to designate a purely plant based product in marketing or advertising, even if those terms are expanded upon by clarifying or descriptive terms indicating the plant origin of the product at issue, unless that product is listed in Annex I to Decision 2010/791.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Seventh Chamber) hereby rules: Article 78(2) and Annex VII, Part III, to Regulation (EU) No 1308/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 December 2013 establishing a common organisation of the markets in agricultural products and repealing Council Regulations (EEC) No 922/72, (EEC) No 234/79, (EC) No 1037/2001 and (EC) No 1234/2007 must be interpreted as precluding the term `milk' and the designations reserved by that regulation exclusively for milk products from being used to designate a purely plant based product in marketing or advertising, even if those terms are expanded upon by clarifying or descriptive terms indicating the plant origin of the product at issue, unless that product is listed in Annex I to Commission Decision 2010/791/EU of 20 December 2010 listing the products referred to in the second subparagraph of point III(1) of Annex XII to Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007.</p>
