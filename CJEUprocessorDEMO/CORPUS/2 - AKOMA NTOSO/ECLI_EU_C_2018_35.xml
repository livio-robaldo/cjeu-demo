            <p>The Bundesverwaltungsgericht (Federal Administrative Court) considers that the appeal court's analysis is wrong, as, in its view, a correct calculation of the period laid down in Article 29(1) of the Dublin III Regulation indicates that Mr Hasan's transfer to Italy took place before that period expired.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, the Bundesverwaltungsgericht (Federal Administrative Court) takes the view that it cannot be definitively established that the Italian Republic was initially responsible for examining Mr Hasan's asylum application, inasmuch as Italy may have to be ruled out as being so responsible, pursuant to Article 3(2) of that regulation, if there are any systemic flaws, as referred to in that provision, in its asylum procedure and reception conditions for applicants for international protection.</p>

            <p>Second, it is, on the contrary, quite clear from Article 29(3) of that regulation that the person concerned must be accepted back by the Member State which transferred him where he has been transferred erroneously or the transfer decision is overturned after the transfer has been carried out, which necessarily implies that the responsibility of the Member State to which the person concerned has been transferred may, in certain cases, be called into question after the transfer has taken place.</p>

            <p>Third, an approach other than that would, moreover, be liable to render largely redundant the appeal or review for which Article 27(1) of the Dublin III Regulation provides and to undermine the judicial protection guaranteed to the persons concerned, since it follows from Article 27(3) of the regulation that the introduction of an appeal or of a request for review does not necessarily entail suspension of the transfer decision and that the fact that such an appeal or request has been introduced does not automatically prevent the transfer from being carried out before the legality of that decision has been assessed by a court or tribunal.</p>

            <p>Fourth, certain provisions of the Dublin III Regulation may result in the responsibility of a Member State being called into question owing to circumstances that have arisen after the transfer to that Member State has been carried out. That is the case, in particular, of Article 19(2) of the regulation when the person concerned has, after that transfer, left the territory of the Member States for a period of at least three months before making a new application for international protection in another Member State (see, to that effect, judgment of 7 June 2016, Karim, C‑155/15, EU:C:2016:410, paragraph 17).</p>

            </tblock>
            <p>86 By question 5(d), the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 24(3) of the Dublin III Regulation must be interpreted as meaning that, where the take back request is not made within the periods laid down in Article 24(2) of that regulation and the person concerned has not made use of the opportunity that he must be given to lodge a new application for international protection, the Member State on whose territory that person is staying without a residence document can still make a take back request or transfer the person concerned to another Member State without making such a request.</p>

            <p>Article 24(3) of the Dublin III Regulation can be distinguished from other provisions relating to the expiry of periods laid down in the regulation in that it does not provide that the expiry of the periods that it concerns entails, in itself, a transfer of responsibility.</p>

            <p>As follows from the answer to question 5(b), when Article 24 of that regulation applies, such a transfer of responsibility depends upon the person concerned making use of the opportunity that he must be given to lodge a new application for international protection in the Member State on whose territory he is staying.</p>

            <p>As the EU legislature has not provided for the expiry of the periods set out in Article 24(2) of the regulation to have any other effect, it must be held that, in cases in which the person concerned does not make use of that opportunity, it remains open to the Member State on whose territory that person is staying to take action accordingly and to initiate, should it so wish, a take back procedure with a view to ensuring that that person goes back to the Member State in which he lodged an application for international protection.</p>

                <p>none of those articles provides for that person to be transferred where there is no explicit or implicit agreement to that effect on the part of the requested Member State, Article 24(3) of that regulation cannot be understood as permitting a Member State to transfer the person to another Member State without making a take back request.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person, read in the light of recital 19 of the regulation and Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, must be interpreted as not precluding a provision of national law, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which provides that the factual situation that is relevant for the review by a court or tribunal of a transfer decision is that obtaining at the time of the last hearing before the court or tribunal determining the matter or, where there is no hearing, at the time when that court or tribunal gives a decision on the matter. 2. Article 24 of Regulation No 604/2013 must be interpreted as meaning that, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, in which a third-country national who, after having made an application for international protection in a first Member State (Member State `A'), was transferred to Member State `A' as a result of the rejection of a fresh application lodged in a second Member State (Member State `B') and has then returned, without a residence document, to Member State `B', a take back procedure may be undertaken in respect of that third-country national and it is not possible to transfer that person anew to Member State `A' without such a procedure being followed. 3. Article 24(2) of Regulation No 604/2013 must be interpreted as meaning that, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, in which a third-country national has returned, without a residence document, to the territory of a Member State that has previously transferred him to another Member State, a take back request must be submitted within the periods prescribed in that provision and those periods may not begin to run until the requesting Member State has become aware that the person concerned has returned to its territory. 4. Article 24(3) of Regulation No 604/2013 must be interpreted as meaning that, where a take back request is not made within the periods laid down in Article 24(2) of that regulation, the Member State on whose territory the person concerned is staying without a residence document is responsible for examining the new application for international protection which that person must be permitted to lodge. 5. Article 24(3) of Regulation No 604/2013 must be interpreted as meaning that the fact that an appeal procedure brought against a decision that rejected a first application for international protection made in a Member State is still pending is not to be regarded as equivalent to the lodging of a new application for international protection in that Member State, as referred to in that provision. 6. Article 24(3) of Regulation No 604/2013 must be interpreted as meaning that, where the take back request is not made within the periods laid down in Article 24(2) of that regulation and the person concerned has not made use of the opportunity that he must be given to lodge a new application for international protection:</p>
