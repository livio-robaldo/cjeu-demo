            <p>In order to answer the questions from the referring court in the present case, the Court must examine the Montego Bay Convention, the Marpol Convention 73/78 and the Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas 1969. Therefore, the status of those conventions with regard to EU law should be set out.</p>

            <p>First, with regard to the Montego Bay Convention, which was signed and approved by the EU, its provisions are an integral part of the European Union legal order and is binding on it. Therefore, the Court has jurisdiction to interpret those provisions. Furthermore, that convention has primacy over secondary EU legislation (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 June 2008, Intertanko and Others, C‑308/06, EU:C:2008:312, paragraphs 42 and 53) which must be interpreted as far as possible in accordance with those agreements.</p>

In view of the customary principle of good faith, which forms part of general international law, and of Article 4(3) TEU, the Court is to interpret the provisions by taking account of the Marpol Convention 73/78 (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 June 2008, Intertanko and Others, C‑308/06, EU:C:2008:312, paragraphs 47 and 52).</p>

It follows that that convention is not binding on the European Union and the court does not have jurisdiction to interpret it as such in a reference for a preliminary ruling (see, by analogy, judgment of 24 June 2008, Commune de Mesquer, C‑188/07, EU:C:2008:359, paragraph 85).</p>

Therefore, the interpretation of Article 220(6) of the Montego Bay Convention must, in principle, be regarded as being applicable to Article 7(2) of Directive 2005/35.</p>

            <p>First of all, Article 220(3) of that convention refers to a violation of applicable international rules and standards for the prevention, reduction and control of pollution from vessels or laws and regulations of that State conforming and giving effect to such international rules and standards, it being understood that it is, in particular, the Marpol Convention 73/78 which defines such violations.</p>

            <p>Thus, that provision states that where there are clear grounds for believing that such a violation has been committed, the coastal State may require the vessel to give information regarding its identity and port of registry, its last and its next port of call and other relevant information required to establish whether a violation has occurred.</p>

            <p>Next, Article 220(5) of the Montego Bay Convention authorises the coastal State to undertake physical inspection of the vessel. For that purpose, that provision requires not only that there are clear grounds for believing that a vessel has committed a violation defined in Article 220(3), but also that that violation is resulting in a substantial discharge causing or threatening significant pollution of the marine environment ( `a violation with serious consequences'). That violation must have led to substantial discharges into the marine environment which have caused or threaten to cause significant pollution.</p>

            <p>Therefore, it appears that by reason of the existence of a violation with serious consequences, referred to in Article 220(5) of the Montego Bay Convention that the authors of that convention authorised the coastal State to adopt a more interventionist measure than that laid down in Article 220(3).</p>

          <content eId="para_16311__content">
            <p>Finally, Article 220(6) of the Montego Bay Convention is comparable to Article 220(5) thereof, in so far as it refers to a violation with serious consequences. The violation within the meaning of that provision must have resulted in a discharge causing major damage or threat of major damage to the coastline or related interests of the coastal State, or to any resources of its territorial sea or EEZ ( `the resources and related interests of the coastal State').</p>

          <content eId="para_16312__content">
            <p>However, those two provisions differ in so far as Article 220(6) of the Montego Bay Convention makes the power to take action by the coastal State subject to the existence of `clear objective evidence' that a violation having serious consequences has actually been committed, not only the existence of clear grounds for believing that such a violation has been committed. Furthermore, where the conditions of applicability of Article 220(6) are satisfied, the coastal State may take particularly drastic action, since it may order the detention of the vessel in accordance with the laws of that State.</p>

            <p>Thus, it appears that the authors of the Montego Bay Convention intended to confer on coastal States the right to take such a particularly drastic measure where the violation committed by a vessel causes or threatens to cause substantial damage to that State and it has been established that the vessel is responsible for such a violation.</p>

            <p>Since those two conditions, which are of equal importance, are cumulative, Article 220(6) of the Montego Bay Convention must therefore be interpreted as providing that the power to take action by the coastal State is subject to the existence of clear objective evidence of the commission by that vessel of a violation within the meaning of Article 220(3) thereof and of the major damage or risk of major damage for the coastal State concerned caused by that violation.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, as the Advocate General stated in point 70 of his Opinion, it is clear from the legislative history of Article 220(6) of the Montego Bay Convention that the contracting parties drew inspiration from the Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas 1969 when establishing that coastal States should also have jurisdiction to take measures against foreign vessels having committed an infringement in the EEZ within the jurisdiction of such a State. Therefore, it must be held that the meaning to be given to `coastline or related interests' in Article 220(6) of the Montego Bay Convention must, in principle, be the same as that which results from Article I(1) and Article II(4) of the Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas 1969.</p>

            <p>That being the case, such an interpretation cannot prevent the coastal State from taking measures of equivalent scope to those laid down in Article 220(6), since that article does not lay down an exhaustive list of authorised measures, as is clear from the use of the expression `inter alia'.</p>

            <p>It is clear from the foregoing considerations that the answer to Question 8 is that Article 1(2) of Directive 2005/35 must be interpreted as meaning that it does not allow the Member States to impose more stringent measures in accordance with international law than those laid down in Article 7(2) thereof, where international law is applicable, given that the coastal States are authorised to take other measures equivalent in scope to those in Article 220(6).</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 220(6) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, signed at Montego Bay on 10 December 1982, and Article 7(2) of Directive 2005/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 September 2005 on ship-source pollution and on the introduction of penalties, including criminal penalties, for pollution offences, as amended by Directive 2009/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009, must be interpreted as meaning that the expression `clear objective evidence' within the meaning of those provisions covers not only the commission of a violation, but also evidence of the consequences of that violation. 2. The expression `coastline or related interests' in Article 220(6) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and Article 7(2) of Directive 2005/35, as amended by Directive 2009/123, must be interpreted as meaning that, in principle, it has the same meaning as the expression `coastline or related interests' in Article I(1) and Article II(4) of the International Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties, concluded at Brussels on 29 November 1969, it being understood that Article 220(6) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea also applied to non-living resources of the territorial sea of the coastal State and to any resources in its exclusive economic zone. 3. Article 220(6) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and Article 7(2) of Directive 2005/35, as amended by Directive 2009/123, must be interpreted as meaning that the resources of the territorial sea and the exclusive economic zone of a coastal State, within the meaning of those provisions, cover both harvested species and also species associated with them and which are dependent on them, such as animal and plant species which feed on the harvested species. 4. It is unnecessary, in principle, to take account of the concept of `significant pollution' referred to in Article 220(5) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea when applying Article 220(6) of that convention and Article 7(2) of Directive 2005/35, as amended by Directive 2009/123, and, in particular, when assessing the consequences of a violation, such as those defined in those provisions. 5. In order to assess the consequences of a violation, as defined in Article 220(6) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and Article 7(2) of Directive 2005/35, as amended by Directive 2009/123, all the evidence to establish that damage has been caused or that there is a threat of damage to the resources and related interests of the coastal State and to evaluate the extent of the damage caused or threatened to those resources or related interests, taking account inter alia of</p>

                <p>the foreseeable harmful consequences of discharge on those resources and related interests, not only on the basis of the available scientific data, but also with regard to the nature of the harmful substance(s) contained in the discharge concerned and the volume, direction, speed and the period of time over which the oil spill spreads 6. The specific geographical and ecological characteristics and sensitivity of the Baltic Sea area have an effect on the conditions of applicability of Article 220(6) of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and Article 7(2) of the Directive 2005/35, as amended by Directive 2009/123, as regards the definition and classification of the violation and, although not automatically, on the assessment of the extent of the damage that that violation has caused to the resources and related interests of the coastal State. 7. Article 1(2) of Directive 2005/35, as amended by Directive 2009/123, must be interpreted as meaning that it does not allow the Member States to impose more stringent measures in accordance with international law that those laid down in Article 7(2) thereof, where international law is applicable, given that the coastal States are authorised to take other measures equivalent in scope to those laid down in Article 220(6).</p>
