The conduct of the individual concerned must represent a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society; justifications that are isolated from the particulars of the case or that rely on considerations of general prevention shall not be accepted. ... Where the Minister or his representative intends to bring to an end the residence of a Union citizen or a family member on grounds of public policy, public security or public health, account shall be taken of the length of the period of residence of the person concerned in [Belgium], his or her age, state of health, family and economic situation, social and cultural integration and the extent of his or her links with the country of origin.'</p>

            <p>Article 74/11 of the Law of 15 December 1980 provides: `§1.   The duration of the entry ban shall be determined by taking account of the specific circumstances of each case. The decision on removal shall be accompanied by an entry ban of a maximum of three years in the following cases: 1° if no period for voluntary departure was granted; or 2° if an earlier decision on removal was not enforced. The maximum period of three years referred to in the second paragraph may be extended to a maximum of five years if: 1° the third-country national has committed fraud or has used other illegal means in order to obtain permission to stay or to retain his right to stay; 2° the third-country national has entered into a marriage, a partnership or an adoption solely in order to obtain permission to stay or to retain his right to stay in [Belgium]. The decision on removal may be accompanied by an entry ban exceeding five years, if the third-country national represents a serious threat to public policy or national security. § 2. ... The Minister or his representative may refrain from issuing an entry ban in individual cases for humanitarian reasons. § 3.   The entry ban shall take effect on the day on which the entry-ban decision is notified. The entry ban cannot run counter to the provisions regarding the right to international protection, as defined in Articles 9b, 48/3 and 48/4.'</p>

            <p>It is apparent from the order for reference that the applicants in the main proceedings are all third-country nationals who are family members of Belgian citizens who have not exercised their right of freedom of movement or establishment. Those applicants are all individuals to whom a return decision has been issued, that decision being accompanied by a decision prohibiting their entry into the Member State concerned (an `entry ban'). For each of the applicants, that entry ban has become final and, according to the referring court, under national law, that ban cannot, as a general rule, be extinguished or temporarily suspended unless there is lodged, outside Belgium, an application for the withdrawal or suspension of that entry ban.</p>

Those applications were not examined by the competent national authority on the ground that the applicants in the main proceedings were persons who were subject to an entry ban that remained in force.

            <p>It is more specifically stated in the order for reference, with respect to, first, K.A., that she, a citizen of Armenia, was issued, on 27 February 2013, with an order to leave Belgium, accompanied by an entry ban with a length of three years, on the ground that she had not complied with her obligation to return and that no period for voluntary departure had been granted to her, since she was considered to be a threat to public policy, after she was apprehended in the act of shoplifting. On 10 February 2014 K. A. and her two sons submitted, when they were in Belgium, an application for residence for the purposes of family reunification on the basis that she and her sons are dependent relatives in the descending line of her father, who is a Belgian national. On 28 March 2014, the competent national authority issued its decision in the form of an order to leave [Belgium], whereby it refused to examine the application for residence because of the entry ban imposed on 27 February 2013.</p>

            <p>Second, with respect to M.Z., who is a Russian national, he was notified, on 2 July 2014, of an order to leave Belgium and an entry ban of a length of three years, on the ground that he had not complied with his obligation to return and that no period for voluntary departure had been granted to him, since he was considered to present a risk to public policy after being charged with theft by breaking into a garage. On 8 September 2014 M.Z. was forcibly repatriated to Russia. On 5 November 2014, when M.Z. was again in Belgium, he made an application for a residence card, on the basis of his status as a dependent relative in the descending line of his Belgian father. On 29 April 2015 the competent national authority refused to examine that application, because of the existence of the entry ban imposed on him, and, in addition, enjoined him to comply with an order to leave Belgium.</p>

            <p>Third, as regards M.J., who is a citizen of Uganda, she was ordered, on two occasions, to leave Belgium, on 13 January 2012 and on 12 November of the same year. On 11 January 2013, she was notified of an entry ban of three years, on the ground that she had not complied with her obligations to return and that no period for voluntary departure had been granted to her, in the light of the risk of absconding, due to her having no fixed address in Belgium, and the fact that she was considered a threat to public policy after charges of assault were brought by the police. On 20 February 2014 M.J. made an application, while she was in Belgium, for a residence card, on the basis of her status as the parent of a minor child of Belgian nationality, born on 26 October 2013. By a decision of 30 April 2014, the competent national authority refused to examine that application for residence for the purposes of family reunification because of the existence of the entry ban of 11 January 2013, and at the same time ordered her to leave Belgium.</p>

            <p>Fourth, as regards N.N.N., who is a national of Kenya, she was the subject of two orders to leave Belgium, on 11 September 2012 and 22 February 2013 respectively. Subsequently, on 3 April 2014 N.N.N. gave birth to a daughter who obtained Belgian nationality, through her father. On 24 April 2014 N.N.N. was the subject of a further order to leave Belgium and was notified of an entry ban of three years on the ground that she had not complied with her obligation to return. On 9 September 2014 N.N.N. made an application, when she was in Belgium, for a residence card, on the basis of her status as a parent of a minor child of Belgian nationality. In support of that application, she produced evidence of payment by her daughter's father of a maintenance contribution and a letter in which the father states that he is unable to be fully responsible for the care of their daughter and that it is preferable that the child remain with her mother. On 4 March 2015 the competent national authority refused to examine her application for residence for the purposes of family reunification, because of the entry ban imposed on N.N.N., and, in addition, enjoined her to comply with an order to leave Belgium.</p>

            <p>Fifth, with respect to O.I.O., who is a Nigerian national, he married R.C., a Belgian national, and they have a daughter who has Belgian nationality. On 11 May 2010 O.I.O. was convicted of assault. After her divorce from O.I.O., R.C. was awarded exclusive parental authority with respect to their daughter on 6 April 2011. The child resides with her mother, who receives family allowances and other social security benefits. Further, the right of O.I.O. to have personal contact with his daughter has been temporarily suspended. Because of the divorce from R.C., a decision to revoke O.I.O.'s right of residence, accompanied by an order to leave Belgium, was adopted. On 28 May 2013 he was notified of an entry ban of eight years because he had not complied with his obligation to return and no period for voluntary departure had been granted to him, on the ground that he presented a serious, real and present threat to public policy. On 6 November 2013 O.I.O. made an application, while he was in Belgium, for a residence card, based on his status as the parent of a minor Belgian child. On 30 April 2014 the competent national authority refused to examine that application because of the existence of the entry ban of 28 May 2013, while at the same time ordering O.I.O. to leave Belgium.</p>

            <p>Sixth, as regards the situation of R.I., who is an Albanian national, it is stated in the order for reference that he is the father of a Belgian child. After the birth of that child, his right of residence, which he had obtained fraudulently, was revoked. He was also notified of an entry ban of five years, on 17 December 2012, because he had resorted to fraud or other illegal means in order to be granted a right of residence or to retain his right of residence. Thereafter, R.I. entered into marriage, in Albania, with the Belgian mother of his child. On 21 August 2014 R.I. made an application, when he was again in Belgium, for a residence card, based on his status as the parent of a minor Belgian child. On13 February 2015 the competent national authority refused to examine that application, because of the entry ban imposed on him, and, in addition, enjoined him to comply with an order to leave Belgium.</p>

Thereafter, B.A., while he was in Belgium, entered into a cohabitation agreement with his Belgian partner and made an application for a residence card, based on his status as the lawfully cohabiting partner of a Belgian citizen with whom he has a permanent and stable relationship. On 21 May 2015, the competent national authority refused to examine the application for residence for the purposes of family reunification, because of the existence of the entry ban of 13 June 2014, and, in addition, enjoined him to comply with an order to leave Belgium.</p>

            <p>The referring court states, first, that, in accordance with a national practice, which is applied in all cases with no room for adaptation to a particular situation, the applications for residence for the purposes of family reunification submitted by the applicants in the main proceedings were not examined, and were therefore not examined on their merits, on the ground that those third-country nationals were individuals who were each subject to an entry ban. Accordingly, no account was taken, in connection with those applications, of family life, or, in the appropriate cases, of the interest of a child, or of the status as Union citizens of the Belgian family members. The referring court also states that it is the view of the competent national authority that the applicants in the main proceedings must first leave Belgium, then make an application for the removal or suspension of the entry ban, before they can submit an application for residence for the purposes of family reunification.</p>

If that does not happen, the decision is to be deemed to be a refusal. Further, only after a decision is adopted on the withdrawal or suspension of the entry will any decision be taken, within a period of six months, on a visa application submitted, for the purposes of family reunification, by the third-country national in his or her State of origin.</p>

Further, the referring court states that the various Union citizens concerned in these cases by reason of the family ties connecting them to the applicants in the main proceedings do not travel regularly to another Member State as workers or service providers, and that those Union citizens have not developed or strengthened a family life with those applicants during a genuine period of residence in a Member State other than Belgium.</p>

            <p>The referring court observes however that the situation of a Union citizen who has not exercised his or her right of freedom of movement cannot on the basis of that fact alone be assimilated to a purely internal situation, in accordance with the judgments of 8 March 2011, Ruiz Zambrano ( C‑34/09, EU:C:2011:124), and of 5 May 2011, McCarthy ( C‑434/09, EU:C:2011:277).</p>

The Court's case-law indicates that account must be taken of whether there is a relationship of dependency between the Union citizen who is a young child and the third-country national, since that dependence may entail that the Union citizen will in fact be compelled to leave the territory of the European Union if the third-country national on whom the child is dependent is not granted a right of residence.</p>

            <p>Following the delivery of the Opinion of the Advocate General, the Belgian Government, by document lodged at the Registry of the Court on 12 December 2017, requested the reopening of the oral part of the procedure so that it might be given the opportunity, first, to respond to the Opinion on the ground it allegedly contained a misinterpretation of Directive 2008/115, and, second, to present its observations on the judgments of 26 July 2017, Ouhrami ( C‑225/16, EU:C:2017:59), and of 14 September 2017, Petrea ( C‑184/16, EU:C:2017:684).</p>

            <p>As regards the criticism made of the Advocate General's Opinion, it must be borne in mind, first, that the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and the Rules of Procedure of the Court make no provision for interested parties to submit observations in response to the Advocate General's Opinion (judgment of 25 October 2017, Polbud -- Wykonawstwo, C‑106/16, EU:C:2017:804, paragraph 23 and the case-law cited).</p>

In this regard, the Court is not bound either by the Opinion delivered by the Advocate General or by the reasoning which led to that Opinion. Consequently, a party's disagreement with the Opinion of the Advocate General, irrespective of the questions examined in the Opinion, cannot in itself constitute grounds justifying the reopening of the oral procedure (judgment of 25 October 2017, Polbud -- Wykonawstwo, C‑106/16, EU:C:2017:804, paragraph 24 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>First, it should at the outset be noted that the situations at issue in the main proceedings all involve the refusal of the competent national authority to examine an application for residence for the purposes of family reunification, submitted in Belgium by a third-country national family member of a Belgian citizen, as either a relative in the descending line, parent or lawfully cohabiting partner of a Belgian citizen, on the ground that the third-country national concerned was subject to an entry ban. The referring court states that, under national law, the applicants in the main proceedings must, as a general rule, submit, in their country of origin, a request for the withdrawal or suspension of the entry ban imposed on them before they can validly submit an application for residence for the purposes of family reunification.</p>

            <p>Second, the referring court adds that, in each of the seven joined cases in the main proceedings, the Belgian citizen concerned has never exercised his right to freedom of movement within the European Union. Consequently, the third-country national family members of the Belgian citizens concerned cannot claim a derived right of residence either under Directive 2004/38 or under Article 21 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 May 2017, Chavez-Vilchez and Others, C‑133/15, EU:C:2017:354, paragraphs 52 to 54).</p>

            <p>Last, it is apparent from the order for reference that the `decisions on removal' adopted by the competent national authority involve the imposition of an obligation, on the applicants in the main proceedings, to leave Belgium, and that those decisions are accompanied by an entry ban. As stated by the Advocate General in point 44 of her Opinion, such decisions consequently must, for the purposes of an examination of the questions referred to the Court, be regarded as `return decisions', within the meaning of Article 3(4) of Directive 2008/115 (see also, to that effect, judgment of 18 December 2014, Abdida, C‑562/13, EU:C:2014:2453, paragraph 39) .</p>

            <p>It is important at the outset to bear in mind that Directive 2008/115 concerns only the return of illegally staying third-country nationals and is thus not designed to harmonise in their entirety Member State rules on the stay of foreign nationals (judgment of 1 October 2015, Celaj, C‑290/14, EU:C:2015:640, paragraph 20). Accordingly, the common standards and procedures established by Directive 2008/115 concern only the adoption of return decisions and the implementation of those decisions (judgment of 6 December 2011, Achughbabian, C‑329/11, EU:C:2011:807, paragraph 29).</p>

            <p>In particular, there is no provision in that directive that lays down rules concerning how to deal with an application for residence for the purposes of family reunification that is submitted, as in the cases in the main proceedings, after the adoption of a return decision accompanied by an entry ban. Further, the refusal to examine such an application in the circumstances described in paragraph 27 of this judgment is not liable to impede the application of the return procedure laid down by that directive.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, the Treaty provisions on citizenship of the Union do not confer any autonomous right on third-country nationals. Any rights conferred on third-country nationals are not autonomous rights of those nationals but rights derived from those enjoyed by a Union citizen. The purpose and justification of those derived rights are based on the fact that a refusal to allow them would be such as to interfere, in particular, with a Union citizen's freedom of movement (judgment of 10 May 2017, Chavez-Vilchez and Others, C‑133/15, EU:C:2017:354, paragraph 62 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In this connection, the Court has previously held that there are very specific situations in which, despite the fact that secondary law on the right of residence of third-country nationals does not apply and the Union citizen concerned has not made use of his freedom of movement, a right of residence must nevertheless be granted to a third-country national who is a family member of that Union citizen, since the effectiveness of Union citizenship would otherwise be undermined, if, as a consequence of refusal of such a right, that citizen would be obliged in practice to leave the territory of the European Union as a whole, thus depriving him of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights conferred by that status (see, to that effect, judgments of 8 March 2011, Ruiz Zambrano, C‑34/09, EU:C:2011:124, paragraphs 43 and 44, and of 10 May 2017, Chavez-Vilchez and Others, C‑133/15, EU:C:2017:354, paragraph 63).</p>

            <p>However, a refusal to grant a right of residence to a third-country national is liable to undermine the effectiveness of Union citizenship only if there exists, between that third-country national and the Union citizen who is a family member, a relationship of dependency of such a nature that it would lead to the Union citizen being compelled to accompany the third-country national concerned and to leave the territory of the European Union as a whole (see, to that effect, judgments of 15 November 2011, Dereci and Others, C‑256/11, EU:C:2011:734, paragraphs 65 to 67; of 6 December 2012, O and Others, C‑356/11 and C‑357/11, EU:C:2012:776, paragraph 56; and of 10 May 2017, Chavez-Vilchez and Others, C‑133/15, EU:C:2017:354, paragraph 69).</p>

            <p>In this case, it is clear that the practice at issue in the main proceedings concerns the procedural rules that govern, in relation to an application for residence for the purposes of family reunification, whether a third-country national may rely on the existence of a derived right under Article 20 TFEU.</p>

It is stated also in the order for reference that no examination of whether there may be a relationship of dependency between that third-country national and the Union citizen who is a family member, as set out in paragraph 52 of this judgment, takes place until the third-country national has obtained the withdrawal or suspension of his or her entry ban.</p>

            <p>Consequently, while it is true that a refusal by a third-country national to comply with the obligation to return and to cooperate in the context of a removal procedure cannot enable him to avoid, in whole or in part, the legal effects of an entry ban (see, to that effect, judgment of 26 July 2017, Ouhrami, C‑225/16, EU:C:2017:590, paragraph 52), the fact remains that, when the competent national authority receives, from a third-country national, an application for a right of residence for the purposes of family reunification with a Union citizen who is a national of the Member State concerned, that authority cannot refuse to examine that application solely on the ground that the third-country national is the subject of a ban on entering that Member State. It is the duty of that authority, on the contrary, to examine that application and to assess whether there exists, between the third-country national and Union citizen concerned, a relationship of dependency of such a nature that a derived right of residence must, as a general rule, be accorded to that third-country national, under Article 20 TFEU, since otherwise the Union citizen would be compelled, in practice, to leave the territory of the European Union as a whole and, therefore, would be deprived of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights conferred on him by that status. In such circumstances, the Member State concerned must withdraw or, at the least, suspend the return decision and the entry ban to which that third-country national is subject.</p>

However, it must be observed that, in the third and fourth subparagraphs of Article 11(3), the EU legislature provided that the Member States may withdraw or suspend an entry ban, in individual cases, for reasons other than that mentioned in the first subparagraph of Article 11(3), and it is not stated in the third and fourth subparagraphs that the third-country national on whom an entry ban has been imposed has to have left the territory of the Member State concerned.</p>

            <p>As regards, first, the cases in the main proceedings where the respective applicants are K.A., M. Z. and B.A., it must, at the outset, be emphasised that, unlike minors and a fortiori minors who are young children, such as the Union citizens concerned in the case that gave rise to the judgment of 8 March 2011, Ruiz Zambrano ( C‑34/09, EU:C:2011:124), an adult is, as a general rule, capable of living an independent existence apart from the members of his family. It follows that the identification of a relationship between two adult members of the same family as a relationship of dependency, capable of giving rise to a derived right of residence under Article 20 TFEU, is conceivable only in exceptional cases, where, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, there could be no form of separation of the individual concerned from the member of his family on whom he is dependent.</p>

            <p>More particularly, in order to assess the risk that a particular child, who is a Union citizen, might be compelled to leave the territory of the European Union and thereby be deprived of the genuine enjoyment of the substance of the rights conferred on him by Article 20 TFEU if the child's third-country national parent were to be refused a right of residence in the Member State concerned, it is important to determine, in each case at issue in the main proceedings, which parent is the primary carer of the child and whether there is in fact a relationship of dependency between the child and the third-country national parent. As part of that assessment, the competent authorities must take account of the right to respect for family life, as stated in Article 7 of the Charter, that article requiring to be read in conjunction with the obligation to take into consideration the best interests of the child, recognised in Article 24(2) of the Charter (judgment of 10 May 2017, Chavez-Vilchez and Others, C‑133/15, EU:C:2017:354, paragraph 70).</p>

In reaching such a conclusion, account must be taken, in the best interests of the child concerned, of all the specific circumstances, including the age of the child, the child's physical and emotional development, the extent of his emotional ties both to the Union citizen parent and to the third-country national parent, and the risks which separation from the latter might entail for that child's equilibrium (judgment of 10 May 2017, Chavez-Vilchez and Others, C‑133/15, EU:C:2017:354, paragraph 71).</p>

            <p>Further, it must be borne in mind that, in the first place, the right of residence in the host Member State, accorded by Article 20 TFEU to a third-country national who is a family member of a Union citizen, stems directly from that provision and does not presuppose that the third-country national already has some other right of residence in the territory of the Member State concerned and, in the second place, since the benefit of that right of residence must be accorded to that third-country national from the moment when the relationship of dependency between him or her and the Union citizen comes into being, that third-country national can no longer be considered, from that moment and for as long as that relationship of dependency lasts, as staying illegally in the territory of the Member State concerned, within the meaning of Article 3(2) of Directive 2008/115.</p>

            <p>As regards, second, the fact that the entry ban is due to public policy grounds, the Court has previously held that Article 20 TFEU does not affect the possibility of Member States relying on an exception linked, in particular, to upholding the requirements of public policy and safeguarding public security. That said, in so far as the situation of the applicants in the main proceedings falls within the scope of EU law, assessment of that situation must take account of the right to respect for private and family life, as laid down in Article 7 of the Charter, an article which must be read, when necessary, in conjunction with the obligation to take into consideration the child's best interests, recognised in Article 24(2) of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgments of 13 September 2016, Rendón Marín, C‑165/14, EU:C:2016:675, paragraph 81, and of 13 September 2016, CS, C‑304/14, EU:C:2016:674, paragraph 36).</p>

            <p>Further, as a justification for derogating from the right of residence of Union citizens or members of their families, the concepts of `public policy' and `public security' must be interpreted strictly. Accordingly, the concept of `public policy' presupposes, in any event, the existence, in addition to the disturbance of the social order which any infringement of the law involves, of a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat affecting one of the fundamental interests of society. As regards the concept of `public security', it is clear from the Court's case-law that that concept covers both the internal security of a Member State and its external security, and, consequently, a threat to the functioning of institutions and essential public services and the survival of the population, as well as the risk of a serious disturbance to foreign relations or to peaceful coexistence of nations, or a threat to military interests, may affect public security. The Court has also held that the fight against crime in connection with drug trafficking as part of an organised group or against terrorism is included within the concept of `public security' (see, to that effect, judgments of 13 September 2016, Rendón Marín, C‑165/14, EU:C:2016:675, paragraphs 82 and 83, and of 13 September 2016, CS, C‑304/14, EU:C:2016:674, paragraphs 37 to 39).</p>

          <content eId="para_11542__content">
            <p>In that context, it must be held that, where the refusal of a right of residence is founded on the existence of a genuine, present and sufficiently serious threat to the requirements of public policy or of public security, in view of, inter alia, criminal offences committed by a third-country national, such a refusal is compatible with EU law even if its effect is that the Union citizen who is a family member of that third-country national is compelled to leave the territory of the European Union (see, to that effect, judgments of 13 September 2016, Rendón Marín, C‑165/14, EU:C:2016:675, paragraph 84, and of 13 September 2016, CS, C‑304/14, EU:C:2016:674, paragraph 40).</p>

            <p>On the other hand, that conclusion cannot be drawn automatically on the basis solely of the criminal record of the person concerned. It can be reached, where appropriate, only after a specific assessment by the national court of all the current and relevant circumstances of the case, in the light of the principle of proportionality, of the child's best interests and of the fundamental rights whose observance the Court ensures (judgments of 13 September 2016, Rendón Marín, C‑165/14, EU:C:2016:675, paragraph 85, and of 13 September 2016, CS, C‑304/14, EU:C:2016:674, paragraph 41).</p>

            <p>That assessment must therefore take account in particular of the personal conduct of the individual concerned, the length and legality of his residence on the territory of the Member State concerned, the nature and gravity of the offence committed, the extent to which the person concerned is currently a danger to society, the age of any children at issue and their state of health, as well as their economic and family situation (judgments of 13 September 2016, Rendón Marín, C‑165/14, EU:C:2016:675, paragraph 86, and of 13 September 2016, CS, C‑304/14, EU:C:2016:674, paragraph 42).</p>

            <p>It is however clear from the order for reference that the national practice at issue in the main proceedings does not require the competent national authority to undertake such a specific assessment of all the relevant circumstances of the individual case before it can reject an application for residence for the purposes of family reunification that is submitted in circumstances such as those of the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>Further, the referring court states that it is not apparent from the decisions challenged before it that any such specific assessment was undertaken at the time of the adoption of the return decisions, accompanied by an entry ban, to which each of the applicants in the main proceedings was subject. In any event, even if that were the case, the competent national authority would nonetheless be under an obligation, at the time when it is contemplating the rejection of the application for residence for the purposes of family reunification submitted by a third-country national, to examine whether, since the adoption of the return decision, the factual background has changed in such a way that a right of residence may no longer be refused to that a third-country national (see, by analogy, judgments of 29 April 2004, Orfanopoulos and Oliveri, C‑482/01 and C‑493/01, EU:C:2004:262, paragraphs 79 and 82, and of 11 November 2004, Cetinkaya, C‑467/02, EU:C:2004:708, paragraphs 45 and 47).</p>

            <p>It follows that Article 20 TFEU must be interpreted as meaning that it is immaterial that an entry ban, imposed on a third-country national who has submitted an application for residence for the purposes of family reunification, may be justified by non-compliance with an obligation to return. Where such a ban is justified on public policy grounds, such grounds may permit a refusal to grant that third-country national a derived right of residence under Article 20 TFEU only if it is apparent from a specific assessment of all the circumstances of the individual case, in the light of the principle of proportionality, the best interests of any child or children concerned and fundamental rights, that the person concerned represents a genuine, present, and sufficiently serious threat to public policy.</p>

            <p>98 By its third question, the referring court seeks, in essence, to ascertain whether Article 5 of Directive 2008/115 and Articles 7 and 24 of the Charter must be interpreted as precluding a national practice pursuant to which a return decision is adopted with respect to a third-country national, on whom a return decision, accompanied by an entry ban, has previously been imposed, without any account being taken of the details of his family life, and in particular the interests of his minor child, referred to in an application for residence for the purposes of family reunification submitted after the imposition of such an entry ban.</p>

            <p>From that perspective, it must, first, be recalled that, in the wording of recital 2 of Directive 2008/115, the aim of that directive is the establishment of an effective removal and repatriation policy, based on common standards, for persons to be returned in a humane manner and with full respect for their fundamental rights and dignity. As is apparent from both its title and Article 1 thereof, Directive 2008/115 establishes for that purpose `common standards and procedures' which must be applied by each Member State for returning illegally staying third-country nationals (judgment of 5 November 2014, Mukarubega, C‑166/13, EU:C:2014:2336, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Moreover, it follows from recital 6 of that directive that the Member States are obliged to adopt, with respect to illegally staying third-country nationals in their territory, a return decision, prescribed by Article 6(1) of that directive, after a fair and transparent procedure.</p>

            <p>More specifically, pursuant to Article 5 of Directive 2008/115, headed `Non-refoulement, best interests of the child, family life and state of health', when the Member States implement that directive, they must, first, take due account of the best interests of the child, family life and the state of health of the third-country national concerned and, second, respect the principle of non-refoulement (judgment of 11 December 2014, Boudjlida, C‑249/13, EU:C:2014:2431, paragraph 48).</p>

            <p>It follows that, when the competent national authority is contemplating the adoption of a return decision, that authority must necessarily observe the obligations imposed by Article 5 of Directive 2008/115 and hear the person concerned on that subject. In that regard, the person concerned must cooperate with the competent national authority when he is heard in order to provide the authority with all the relevant information on his personal and family situation and, in particular, information which might justify a return decision not being issued (judgment of 11 December 2014, Boudjlida, C‑249/13, EU:C:2014:2431, paragraphs 49 and 50).</p>

That duty of honest cooperation means that he or she is obliged, as soon as possible, to inform that authority of any relevant changes in his or her family life. The right of a third-country national to expect that changes in his or her family situation will be taken into account before a return decision is adopted cannot be used in order to re-open or extend indefinitely the administrative procedure (see, by analogy, judgment of 5 November 2014, Mukarubega, C‑166/13, EU:C:2014:2336, paragraph 71).</p>

Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals, in particular Articles 5 and 11 thereof, must be interpreted as not precluding a practice of a Member State that consists in not examining an application for residence for the purposes of family reunification, submitted on its territory by a third-country national family member of a Union citizen who is a national of that Member State and who has never exercised his or her right to freedom of movement, solely on the ground that that third-country national is the subject of a ban on entering the territory of that Member State. 2.
