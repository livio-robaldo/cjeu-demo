                <p>Some existing Union legal acts already contain provisions concerning [alternative dispute resolution (ADR)]. In order to ensure legal certainty, it should be provided that, in the event of conflict, this Directive is to prevail, except where it explicitly provides otherwise. In particular, this Directive should be without prejudice to Directive [2008/52], which already sets out a framework for systems of mediation at Union level for cross-border disputes, without preventing the application of that Directive to internal mediation systems. This Directive is intended to apply horizontally to all types of ADR procedures, including to ADR procedures covered by Directive [2008/52]. ...</p>

                <p>The right to an effective remedy and the right to a fair trial are fundamental rights laid down in Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Therefore, ADR procedures should not be designed to replace court procedures and should not deprive consumers or traders of their rights to seek redress before the courts. This Directive should not prevent parties from exercising their right of access to the judicial system. In cases where a dispute could not be resolved through a given ADR procedure whose outcome is not binding, the parties should subsequently not be prevented from initiating judicial proceedings in relation to that dispute. Member States should be free to choose the appropriate means to achieve this objective. They should have the possibility to provide, inter alia, that limitation or prescription periods do not expire during an ADR procedure.'</p>

            <p>The referring court, the Tribunale Ordinario di Verona (Verona District Court, Italy), notes that, under national law, such an application to have an order set aside is admissible only on condition that the parties have first initiated a mediation procedure, pursuant to Article 5(1bis) and (4) of Legislative Decree No 28/2010. The referring court also establishes that the dispute before it falls within the scope of the Consumer Code, as amended by Legislative Decree No 130/2015 transposing Directive 2013/11 into Italian law. Mr Menini and Ms Rampanelli should be regarded as `consumers', within the meaning of Article 4(a) of that directive, having concluded contracts which may be classified as `service contracts' within the meaning of Article 4(d) of that directive.</p>

            <p>According to the referring court, it is not clear that the fact that Directive 2013/11 expressly refers to Directive 2008/52 means that the first of those directives was intended to entitle Member States to provide for mandatory use of a mediation procedure rather than the ADR procedure provided for by Directive 2013/11 as regards disputes involving consumers. When Article 5(2) of Directive 2008/52 permits Member States to provide for mediation as a condition for the admissibility of legal proceedings, it is not mandatory since it leaves that choice to the Member States.</p>

            <p>That said, the referring court takes the view that the provisions of Italian law on mandatory mediation are contrary to Directive 2013/11. According to the referring court, that directive establishes a single, exclusive and harmonised system for disputes involving consumers, binding the Member States as to achievement of the objective pursued by that directive. That directive should therefore apply also to the procedures covered by Directive 2008/52.</p>

            <p>The referring court also points out that Article 9 of Directive 2013/11 leaves the parties the choice not only of whether or not to take part in the ADR procedure, but also of withdrawing from it at any stage, with the result that mandatory use of mediation, provided for by national law, would put the consumer in a less favourable position than if such use were merely optional.</p>

            <p>Finally, according to the referring court, the mandatory mediation procedure provided for in national law is contrary to Article 9(2) of Directive 2013/11, in so far as, in the national procedure, the parties may not withdraw from the mediation procedure at any time unconditionally if they are not satisfied with the performance or operation of that procedure. They may do so only by relying on a valid reason; otherwise they will be liable to a fine which the court is required to impose, even if the party who withdrew from the mediation procedure was successful at the end of the legal proceedings.</p>

The Italian Government claims that that dispute follows on from order for payment proceedings instituted by a trader against a consumer and, as such, falls outside the scope of Directive 2013/11. The German Government considers that the referring court has not specified whether the mediation procedure established by Legislative Decree No 28/2010 is an `ADR procedure' before an `ADR entity', as defined by Directive 2013/11, which is the only situation in which that directive would apply.</p>

Article 1(2) provides that that directive is to apply to cross-border disputes in civil and commercial matters, that is to say, in accordance with Article 2 of that directive, any dispute in which at least one of the parties is domiciled or habitually resident in a Member State other than that of any other party.</p>

            <p>As regards the first condition, the question whether an ADR procedure, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, must be regarded as having been initiated not by a trader but by a consumer is a matter for the national court to determine and falls within the scope of the national law of each Member State. Consequently, as regards the main proceedings, it is for the referring court to determine whether an application to have an order for payment set aside and an application for a stay of provisional enforcement associated with that measure constitute a complaint by a consumer, of an independent nature in relation to the order for payment proceedings instituted by a trader working in credit, such as the trader at issue in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>As regards the second and third conditions, the request for a preliminary ruling does not specify whether the mediation procedure provided for in Italian legislation takes place before an ADR entity, in accordance with Directive 2013/11. Likewise, it is for the referring court to assess whether the entity referred to in Article 141(4) of the Consumer Code, as amended by Legislative Decree No 130/2015, is an ADR entity which satisfies the conditions laid down in Directive 2013/11, since that is a condition for the application of that directive.</p>

            <p>As regards the three elements contained in the question raised by the referring court and, in the first place, as regards the requirement for a mediation procedure as a condition for the admissibility of legal proceedings concerning the dispute forming the subject matter of that procedure, as provided for in Article 5(1bis) of Legislative Decree No 28/2010, it is true that the first sentence of Article 1 of Directive 2013/11 provides for an option for consumers to submit, `on a voluntary basis', complaints against traders to ADR entities.</p>

            <p>That interpretation is supported by Article 3(a) of Directive 2008/52 which defines mediation as a structured process, however named or referred to, whereby two or more parties to a dispute attempt by themselves, on a voluntary basis, to reach an agreement on the settlement of their dispute. This process may be initiated by the parties or suggested or ordered by a court, but also prescribed by the law of a Member State. Furthermore, in accordance with Article 5(2) thereof, Directive 2008/52 is without prejudice to national legislation making the use of mediation compulsory, provided that such legislation does not prevent the parties from exercising their right of access to the judicial system.</p>

            <p>As stated in recital 13 of Directive 2008/52, the voluntary nature of the mediation lies, therefore, not in the freedom of the parties to choose whether or not to use that process but in the fact that `the parties are themselves in charge of the process and may organise it as they wish and terminate it at any time'.</p>

That condition might prejudice implementation of the principle of effective judicial protection (see, to that effect, judgment of 18 March 2010, Alassini and Others, C‑317/08 to C‑320/08, EU:C:2010:146, paragraph 62).</p>

            <p>That said, as recital 45 of Directive 2013/11 in essence states, Member States are free to choose the means they deem appropriate for the purposes of ensuring that access to the judicial system is not hindered. The fact, first, that the outcome of the ADR procedure is not binding on the parties and, secondly, the fact that the limitation periods do not expire during such a procedure are two means which, amongst others, would be appropriate for the purposes of achieving that objective.</p>

Furthermore, in accordance with Article 9(2)(b) of that directive, at the end of the ADR procedure, a solution is merely proposed to the parties and they have the choice as to whether or not to agree to or follow it.</p>

            <p>In the second place, as regards the obligation, on the part of the consumer, to be assisted by a lawyer in order to initiate a mediation procedure, the answer to that question derives from the wording of Article 8(b) of Directive 2013/11. That article, relating to the effectiveness of the procedure, provides that the Member States are to ensure that the parties have access to the ADR procedure without being obliged to retain a lawyer or a legal advisor. Furthermore, Article 9(1)(b) of that directive provides that each party must be informed that they are not obliged to retain a lawyer or a legal advisor.</p>

            <p>Finally, in the third place, as regards the question whether Directive 2013/11 must be interpreted as precluding a provision of national law to the effect that consumers may withdraw from a mediation procedure only in the event that they demonstrate the existence of a valid reason in support of that decision, on pain of penalties in the context of subsequent legal proceedings, it is necessary to take the view that such a limitation restricts the parties' right of access to the judicial system, contrary to the objective of Directive 2013/11, recalled in Article 1 thereof. Any withdrawal from an ADR procedure by a consumer must not have unfavourable consequences for that consumer in the context of proceedings before the courts relating to the dispute which formed, or which ought to have formed, the subject matter of that procedure.</p>

            <p>The latter consideration is supported by the wording of Article 9(2)(a) of Directive 2013/11 which, as regards ADR procedures which seek to resolve the dispute by proposing a solution, requires Member States to ensure that the parties have the possibility of withdrawing from the procedure at any stage if they are dissatisfied with the performance or the operation of the procedure.</p>

If that is the case, which it is for the referring court to determine, Directive 2013/11 does not preclude national legislation which entitles a consumer to refuse to participate in a prior mediation procedure only on the basis of a valid reason, to the extent that he may bring it to an end without restriction immediately after the first meeting with the mediator.</p>
