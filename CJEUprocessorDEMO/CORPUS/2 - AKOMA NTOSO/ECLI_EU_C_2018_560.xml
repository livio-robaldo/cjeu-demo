            <p>In support of its appeal on a point of law before the Augstākā tiesa (Supreme Court, Latvia), E LATS claims, inter alia, that the application of the margin scheme cannot depend on whether or not it knew the use, namely resale or processing, to which the buyer would put the goods sold, and that it was illogical to consider that grouping items of jewellery together should lead to their classification being changed from `second-hand goods' to `scrap'.</p>

            <p>The referring court considers that the goods at issue in the main proceedings, which are sold with the sole purpose of recovering from them the precious metals and precious stones that they contain, do not fall within the concept of `second-hand goods' referred to in Article 311(1)(1) of the VAT Directive, but within the concept of `precious metals and precious stones' in that provision. It also takes the view that that provision does not grant Member States a discretion in that regard. However, according to the referring court, the Court of Justice has not yet ruled on such an interpretation of that provision and its interpretation is of crucial importance to the resolution of the case.</p>

                <p>Must Article 311(1)(1) of [the VAT Directive] be interpreted as meaning that used articles, acquired by a trader, that contain precious metals or precious stones (as in the present case) and are resold principally in order for those precious metals or precious stones to be extracted, may be regarded as second-hand goods?</p>

                <p>If the answer to question 1 is in the affirmative, is it relevant, for the purpose of limiting the application of the special arrangements, that the trader knows that the subsequent buyer intends to extract the precious metals or precious stones present in the used articles, or are the objective characteristics of the transaction (the quantity of goods, legal status of the counterparty to the transaction, etc.) relevant?'</p>

            <p>Regarding, in the first place, the wording of Article 311(1)(1) of the VAT Directive, it should be recalled that, under that provision, `second-hand goods' are defined as `movable tangible property that is suitable for further use as it is or after repair, other than works of art, collectors' items or antiques and other than precious metals or precious stones as defined by the Member States'.</p>

              <item>

            <p>As regards the first and second of those conditions, it must be noted that the Court has already ruled that the concept of `second-hand goods', within the meaning of Article 311(1)(1) of the VAT Directive, does not exclude movable tangible property that is suitable for further use, as it is or after repair, coming from other property in which it was incorporated as a component, and that, in order to be characterised as `second-hand goods', it is necessary only that the used property has maintained the functionalities it possessed when new and that it may, therefore, be reused as it is or after repair (see, to that effect, judgment of 18 January 2017, Sjelle Autogenbrug, C‑471/15, EU:C:2017:20, paragraphs 31 and 32).</p>

            <p>As regards the third condition, it should be noted that, whilst, under Article 311(1)(1) of the VAT Directive, works of art, collectors' items and antiques cannot be classified as `second-hand goods', those items, unlike precious metals and precious stones, may nevertheless qualify for the scheme for taxation of the profit margin made by the taxable dealer, which constitutes a scheme derogating from the general scheme of the VAT Directive (see, to that effect, judgment of 18 May 2017, Litdana, C‑624/15, EU:C:2017:389, paragraph 24).</p>

            <p>It must also be stated that Article 311(1)(1) of the VAT Directive expressly mentions actual precious metals and precious stones, but it makes no express reference to items containing precious metals or precious stones and suitable for `further use', within the meaning of that provision as interpreted by the Court.</p>

          <content eId="para_16460__content">
            <p>Regarding, in the second place, the context of Article 311(1)(1) of the VAT Directive, it is to be noted that Article 311 is the only article in Section 1, entitled `Definitions', of Chapter 4 of the VAT Directive, a chapter dedicated to special arrangements for second-hand goods, works of art, collectors' items and antiques. Those special arrangements derogate from the general scheme of the VAT Directive and must therefore be applied only to the extent necessary to achieve their objective (see, to that effect, judgment of 8 December 2005, Jyske Finans, C‑280/04, EU:C:2005:753, paragraph 35).</p>

          <num>25</num>
          <content eId="para_16461__content">
            <p>Since no provision of Chapter 4 relates to precious metals or precious stones or to items containing such metals or stones, no conclusion can be drawn from the context of Article 311(1)(1) of the VAT Directive for the purpose of establishing to what extent items made of precious metals and/or precious stones may be considered `second-hand goods', within the meaning of that provision.</p>

            <p>In that regard, first, it should be noted that that provision contains the definitions applicable to the margin scheme and that it is clear from recital 51 of the VAT Directive that the objective of that scheme is to avoid double taxation and distortions of competition between taxable persons in the area of second-hand goods, works of art, collectors' items or antiques (judgment of 18 May 2017, Litdana, C‑624/15, EU:C:2017:389, paragraph 25).</p>

            <p>Next, as the Advocate General has observed in points 49 to 55 of his Opinion, the exclusion of precious metals and precious stones from the margin scheme is due to the fact that the value which should be attached to precious metals and precious stones does not stem solely from their usefulness as a raw material for the production of other goods, but essentially depends on the intrinsic value that may be attributed to them. Therefore, without there even being any need to integrate them or transform them into a product with a particular function, such metals and stones have an intrinsic functionality which is that they represent a financial value that may be achieved on the market for precious metals or precious stones. Moreover, that intrinsic value is not lost since the metals and stones can be reused many times owing to the fact that those materials are easily recovered and transformed while retaining their value.</p>

            <p>Finally, it is clear from the history of Council Directive 94/5/EC of 14 February 1994 supplementing the common system of value added tax and amending Directive 77/388/EEC -- Special arrangements applicable to second-hand goods, works of art, collectors' items and antiques ( OJ 1994 L 60, p. 16), which inserted in Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes -- Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment ( OJ 1977 L 145, p. 1), Article 26a the wording of which is identical to that of Article 311(1)(1) of the VAT Directive that the legislature intended, to a certain extent, to allow objects containing precious metals or precious stones to benefit from the margin scheme.</p>

            <p>In its proposal for a directive (COM(88) 846 final), the European Commission proposed that the margin scheme should cover `objects ... made of gold or any other precious metal or containing precious stones, where the value of such materials incorporated does not exceed 50% of the selling price of those objects', thus introducing a distinction between, on the one hand, precious metals and precious stones and, on the other hand, objects made of those materials, such as jewellery.</p>

            <p>However, as the Advocate General has stated in points 45 to 48 of his Opinion, in the final version of Article 26a of Sixth Directive 77/388 all references to objects containing precious metals or precious stones had been removed and only `precious metals and precious stones' in themselves were excluded from the margin scheme, the definition of what was to be understood by `precious metals or precious stones' being a matter for the Member States.</p>

            <p>Although the EU legislature thus accorded the Member States the power to define `precious metals or precious stones', according to the case-law of the Court such a power to define is limited by the prohibition on undermining not only the very terms of the derogation established by the EU legislature, by adopting a definition so wide that it would deprive the concept of `second-hand goods' of its content (see, to that effect, judgments of 28 June 2007, JP Morgan Fleming Claverhouse Investment Trust and The Association of Investment Trust Companies, C‑363/05, EU:C:2007:391, paragraph 21, and of 13 March 2014, ATP PensionService, C‑464/12, EU:C:2014:139, paragraph 41), but also the objectives pursued by the VAT Directive and the principle of fiscal neutrality inherent in the common system of VAT (see, to that effect, judgment of 13 March 2014, ATP PensionService, C‑464/12, EU:C:2014:139, paragraph 42).</p>

            <p>It follows that, in order for an object composed of precious metals or precious stones to be capable of falling within the category of `second-hand goods', within the meaning of Article 311(1)(1) of the VAT Directive, which are eligible for the special margin scheme, and not that of `precious metals or precious stones', which are excluded from that scheme, it must have had a functionality other than that which is inherent in the materials of which it is composed, have retained that functionality and be suitable for further use, as it is or after repair.</p>

            <p>By contrast, as the Advocate General has stated in point 72 of his Opinion, where an object has no functionality other than that inherent in its component materials, or is not capable of fulfilling any other function, the object in question does not qualify for the special margin scheme since it is no longer in the same economic cycle and will be useful only for the purposes of being transformed into a new object, which will have a new economic cycle, with the result that the risk of double taxation, which is the basis for the establishment of the margin scheme, disappears.</p>

            <p>The factors which must be taken into account in order to establish, in a particular case, whether a resold item falls within the category of `second-hand goods' or that of `precious metals and precious stones' include all the objective circumstances in which the resale has taken place. As is clear from the Court's case-law, the terms contained in the VAT Directive are objective in nature and apply without regard to the purpose or results of the transactions concerned (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 July 2006, Kittel and Recolta Recycling, C‑439/04 and C‑440/04, EU:C:2006:446, paragraph 41).</p>

            <p>Consequently, taking into consideration factors such as the intention of a taxable person participating in the transaction is, save in exceptional cases, contrary to the objectives of the common system of VAT of ensuring legal certainty and facilitating the measures necessary for the application of VAT by having regard to the objective character of the transaction concerned (judgment of 6 July 2006, Kittel and Recolta Recycling, C‑439/04 and C‑440/04, EU:C:2006:446, paragraph 42 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>By contrast, as the Advocate General has noted in points 78 and 82 of his Opinion, factors such as the presentation of the items in question, the method of valuing them and the method of charging, namely in bulk (gross/weight) or per item, are objective factors that may legitimately be taken into consideration.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be added that, since the taxable amount determined in accordance with the margin scheme must result from accounts from which it may be ascertained that all the conditions for applying that scheme have been fulfilled (judgment of 18 January 2017, Sjelle Autogenbrug, C‑471/15, EU:C:2017:20, paragraph 43), the accounts of the taxable dealer and the connected invoices may, save in exceptional cases, provide objective information on the transaction in question and the items sold.</p>

            <p>In the light of all the foregoing, the answer to the questions referred is that Article 311(1)(1) of the VAT Directive must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of `second-hand goods' does not cover used goods containing precious metals or precious stones if those goods are no longer capable of performing their initial function and have retained only the functionalities inherent in those metals and stones, which is for the national court to determine taking into account all the objective circumstances relevant in each individual case.</p>
