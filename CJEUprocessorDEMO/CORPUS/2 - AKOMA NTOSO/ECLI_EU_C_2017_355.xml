            <p>The referring court notes, first of all, that the contributions and levies in question constitute `taxes' under national law, so that the fact that Mr de Lobkowicz or the members of his family do not receive any direct benefit in return for payment of those contributions and levies is irrelevant for the purpose of determining whether they are justified.</p>

            <p>The referring court then states that it is clear from the judgment of the Court of Justice of 26 February 2015, de Ruyter ( C‑623/13, EU:C:2015:123), that tax levies on income from assets with a direct and relevant link with some of the branches of social security listed in Article 4 of Regulation No 1408/71, namely CSG, the social levy of 2% and the additional contribution of 0.3%, fall within the scope of the regulation. On the same grounds as those established by the Court of Justice in that judgment, the referring court finds that the additional contribution at the rate of 1.1% must also be regarded as falling within the scope of the regulation.</p>

            <p>However, the referring court recalls that the Court of Justice has already held, in paragraph 41 of its judgment of 3 October 2000, Ferlini ( C‑411/98, EU:C:2000:530), that EU officials and the members of their families, for whom affiliation to the social security scheme of the EU institutions is compulsory, cannot be characterised as workers within the meaning of Regulation No 1408/71. Therefore, according to the referring court, the principle that the legislation of a single Member State only is applicable, which is enshrined in Article 13 of the regulation, does not apply to them.</p>

          <content eId="para_7063__content">
            <p>Lastly, the referring court states that even if EU officials have the status of worker within the meaning of Article 45 TFEU, that article does not lay down any general rules governing the allocation of competences between the Member States and the EU institutions regarding the funding of social security benefits or special non-contributory benefits to suggest, as Mr de Lobkowicz does, that the obligation he is under to pay the contributions and levies at issue should be characterised as a `discriminatory measure' for the purposes of that article.</p>

            <p>Taking the view, however, that there is still some doubt as to whether the obligation Mr de Lobkowicz is under to pay the contributions and levies at issue is compatible with EU law, the cour administrative d'appel de Douai (Administrative Court of Appeal, Douai) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling: `Is there any principle of EU law which precludes an official of the European Commission from being subject to the contribution sociale généralisée(general social contribution), the social levy and contributions additional to that levy at the rates of 0.3% and 1.1% in respect of income from real estate received in a Member State of the European Union?'</p>

            <p>The French Government submits, primarily, that the request for a preliminary ruling is inadmissible on the ground that it does not provide the Court with the factual material necessary to enable the Court to give a useful answer to the question put to it. According to the French Government, the referring court asked a question which concerns Article 45 TFEU without specifying, however, either the nationality of the applicant in the main proceedings or whether he has made use of his right of free movement in the pursuit of professional activity.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be borne in mind that the Court of Justice may refuse to rule on a request made by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (see, inter alia, judgments of 22 June 2010, Melki and Abdeli, C‑188/10 and C‑189/10, EU:C:2010:363, paragraph 27 and the case-law cited, and of 18 April 2013, Mulders, C‑548/11, EU:C:2013:249, paragraph 27).</p>

            <p>The need to provide an interpretation of EU law which will be of use to the referring court, as made clear by Article 94 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, requires that court to define the factual and legislative context of the questions it is asking or, at the very least, to explain the factual circumstances on which those questions are based (judgments of 11 March 2010, Attanasio Group, C‑384/08, EU:C:2010:133, paragraph 32, and of 5 December 2013, Zentralbetriebsrat der gemeinnützigen Salzburger Landeskliniken, C‑514/12, EU:C:2013:799, paragraph 17).</p>

            <p>In the present case, it must be pointed out that the question submitted by the referring court undoubtedly concerns the interpretation of EU law. In that respect, it should be noted that, contrary to the French Government's assertions, the question does not expressly concern Article 45 TFEU but refers, in general terms, to the existence of `any principle of EU law' which may preclude an EU official from being subject to social levies and contributions, such as those at issue in the main proceedings, in respect of income from real estate received in the Member State of his domicile for tax purposes.</p>

            <p>By its question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the principle that the legislation of a single Member State only is to apply in matters of social security, as set out in Regulation No 1408/71 and, subsequently, in Regulation No 883/2004, and as specified in the judgment of the Court of Justice of 26 February 2015, de Ruyter ( C‑623/13, EU:C:2015:123), must be interpreted as meaning that it precludes national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which provides that income from real estate received in a Member State by an EU official who has his or her domicile for tax purposes in that Member State is subject to contributions and social levies that are allocated for the funding of the social security scheme of that same Member State.</p>

            <p>Secondly, an EU official may have the status of a migrant worker for the purposes of Article 45 TFEU as a national of a Member State working in the territory of a Member State other than his or her State of origin. However, the fact nevertheless remains that, in so far as EU officials are not subject to national legislation on social security, as referred to in Article 2(1) of Regulation No 1408/71 and in the same article of Regulation No 883/2004, which defines the persons covered by those regulations, they cannot be characterised as `workers' within the meaning of those provisions. Nor are they covered, in that context, by Article 48 TFEU, which conferred on the Council the task of instituting a scheme allowing workers to overcome any obstacles which may arise for them from national rules in the field of social security, a task which the Council fulfilled by adopting Regulation No 1408/71 and, subsequently, Regulation No 883/2004 (see, to that effect, judgments of 3 October 2000, Ferlini, C‑411/98, EU:C:2000:530, paragraphs 41 and 42, and of 16 December 2004, My, C‑293/03, EU:C:2004:821, paragraphs 34 to 37).</p>

It follows that all Member States are also bound by the Staff Regulations (see, to that effect, judgments of 20 October 1981, Commission v Belgium, 137/80, EU:C:1981:237, paragraphs 7 and 8; of 7 May 1987, Commission v Belgium, 186/85, EU:C:1987:208, paragraph 21; of 4 December 2003, Kristiansen, C‑92/02, EU:C:2003:652, paragraph 32; and of 4 February 2015, Melchior, C‑647/13, EU:C:2015:54, paragraph 22).</p>

Article 73(1) of the Staff Regulations states that officials are, from the date of their entry into the service, insured against the risk of occupational disease or accidents and that they are to contribute to the cost of insuring against non-occupational risks up to 0.1% of their basic salary. Article 83(2) of the Staff Regulations also provides that officials are to contribute one third of the cost of the pension scheme, with that contribution being a given percentage of their basic salary.</p>

            <p>The foregoing analysis is not called in question by the French Government's claims that the contributions and social levies at issue in the main proceedings are classified as `taxes' that are levied on income from real estate, not on earned income, and which do not directly give rise to any benefits in return or to any advantage in terms of social security benefits. In fact, as is apparent from the information provided by the referring court, those levies and contributions are in any event allocated specifically and directly for the funding of certain branches of the French social security scheme. An EU official such as Mr de Lobkowicz cannot, accordingly, be subject to those levies and contributions since his financial obligations in matters of social security are governed exclusively by the Protocol and the Staff Regulations and, as such, fall outside the jurisdiction of the Member States (see, by analogy, with regard to Regulation No 1408/71, judgment of 26 February 2015, de Ruyter, C‑623/13, EU:C:2015:123, paragraphs 23, 26, 28 and 29).</p>
