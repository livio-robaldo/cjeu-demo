            <p>Following an inspection of the two ships carried out on 7 June 2007, the URSSAF found irregularities concerning the insurance cover of the employees performing hotel-related activities. That finding gave rise to a recovery notice, sent to A-Rosa on 22 October 2007, for an amount of EUR 2024123 in respect of arrears of social security contributions to the French social security system for the period from 1 April 2005 to 30 September 2007.</p>

That action was dismissed by decision of 9 February 2011. The tribunal des affaires de sécurité sociale du Bas-Rhin considered that A-Rosa's activities were entirely geared towards the territory of France and that those activities were carried out in France on a habitual, stable and continuous basis, so that A-Rosa could not rely on Article 14(1) of Regulation No 1408/71, which it had invoked in its action, because that provision governs the specific situation of workers who are posted to the territory of another Member State.</p>

In that context, the Court is only empowered to rule on the interpretation or validity of EU law in the light of the factual and legal situation as described by the referring court, in order to provide that court with such guidance as will assist it in resolving the dispute before it (judgment of 28 July 2016, Kratzer, C‑423/15, EU:C:2016:604, paragraph 27).</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the EU legislature makes provision, in Article 84a(3) of Regulation No 1408/71, in the event of difficulties in the interpretation or application of that regulation which could jeopardise the rights of a person covered by the regulation, for, in the first place, dialogue between the competent institutions of the Member States concerned, and, in the second place, recourse to the Administrative Commission.</p>

            <p>Moreover, Regulation No 987/2009, currently in force, codified the Court's case-law, affirming the binding nature of the E 101 certificate and the exclusive competence of the issuing institution to assess the validity of that certificate, and expressly reproducing the procedure called in question by the French Government and by the URSSAF as a means of resolving disputes concerning both the accuracy of documents drawn up by the competent institution of a Member State and determining the legislation applicable to the worker concerned.</p>

            <p>Lastly, the fact that, in the present case, the State issuing the E 101 certificates is the Swiss Confederation and that, consequently, no infringement proceedings may be brought against that State, as pointed out by the French Government, has no effect on the binding nature of the E 101 certificates at issue in the main proceedings, as the EC-Switzerland Agreement lays down its own system for resolving disputes between the Contracting Parties, as noted by the Advocate General in point 65 of his Opinion.</p>

            <p>Having regard to the foregoing, the answer to the question referred is that Article 12a(1a) of Regulation No 574/72 must be interpreted as meaning that an E 101 certificate issued by the institution designated by the competent authority of a Member State pursuant to Article 14(2)(a) of Regulation No 1408/71 is binding on both the social security institutions of the Member State in which the work is carried out and the courts of that Member State, even where it is found by those courts that the conditions under which the worker concerned carries out his activities clearly do not fall within the material scope of that provision of Regulation No 1408/71.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules: Article 12a(1a) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 574/72 of 21 March 1972 fixing the procedure for implementing Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 of the Council of 14 June 1971 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community, as amended and updated by Council Regulation (EC) No 118/97 of 2 December 1996, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 647/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 April 2005, must be interpreted as meaning that an E 101 certificate issued by the institution designated by the competent authority of a Member State pursuant to Article 14(2)(a) of Regulation No 1408/71, as amended and updated by Regulation No 118/97, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 647/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 April 2005, is binding on both the social security institutions of the Member State in which the work is carried out and the courts of that Member State, even where it is found by those courts that the conditions under which the worker concerned carries out his activities clearly do not fall within the material scope of that provision of Regulation No 1408/71.</p>
