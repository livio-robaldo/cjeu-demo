The single, common general prohibition established by this Directive therefore covers unfair commercial practices distorting consumers' economic behaviour. In order to support consumer confidence the general prohibition should apply equally to unfair commercial practices which occur outside any contractual relationship between a trader and a consumer or following the conclusion of a contract and during its execution. The general prohibition is elaborated by rules on the two types of commercial practices which are by far the most common, namely misleading commercial practices and aggressive commercial practices.'</p>

            <p>As regards, first of all, the question whether a debt collection activity is liable to fall within the scope of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, it should be borne in mind, first, that Article 2(d) of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive defines, using a particularly broad formulation, the concept of `commercial practices' as `any act, omission, course of conduct or representation, commercial communication including advertising and marketing, by a trader, directly connected with the promotion, sale or supply of a product to consumers' (judgment of 19 September 2013, CHS Tour Services, C‑435/11, EU:C:2013:574, paragraph 27).</p>

            <p>Moreover, under Article 3(1) of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, read in the light of Recital 13 thereof, that directive applies to unfair commercial practices in which an undertaking engages, even outside any contractual relationship, either before or after the conclusion of a contract, or following the conclusion of a contract or during the performance thereof.</p>

            <p>Consequently, the words `directly connected with the sale of a product' cover any measure taken in relation not only to the conclusion of a contract but also to its performance, and in particular the measures taken in order to obtain payment for the product.</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is apparent from the order for reference that the claims assigned to Gelvora originate in the supply of a service, namely the provision of credit, the consideration for which consists in the repayment of the credit in instalments to which interest at a rate previously agreed is added.</p>

            <p>That finding is not called into question by the fact, referred to in the first and third questions referred for a preliminary ruling, that the recovery measures are taken by a legal person which has acquired a claim against a consumer as a result of the assignment of that claim by the original lender and which is acting as a trader in relation to that consumer.</p>

          <content eId="para_13879__content">
            <p>Although a debt collection agency, such as Gelvora, does not provide the consumer with a consumer credit service as such, the fact remains that the activity in which it engages, namely the recovery of debts which have been assigned to it, falls under the concept of `commercial practice' which may be unfair, within the meaning of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, since the measures which it adopts are liable to influence the consumer's decision in respect of the payment of the product.</p>

            <p>In that context, the Commission, in the document entitled `Guidance on the implementation/application of Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices' of 25 May 2016 [SWD (2016) 163 final], indicates that debt collection activities should be considered as after-sales commercial practices. Furthermore, it is clear from the examples cited by the Commission in that document that a number of national courts take the view that the activities of collection agencies fall within the scope of that directive.</p>

            <p>First, the conditions in which a debt owed by a consumer may be recovered may be so important as to decisively influence the consumer's decision to take out a loan, particularly where the measures taken to recover the debt take the form of those at issue in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>Second, if the application of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive were excluded in respect of credit repayment transactions in the event of the assignment of a debt, that could call into question the effectiveness of the protection afforded to consumers by that directive, since professionals could be tempted to separate the recovery phase, in order not to be subject to the protective provisions of that directive.</p>

          <content eId="para_13883__content">
            <p>For that same reason, finally, the fact that the obligation to pay the debt was confirmed by a court decision and that the debt collection agency, in parallel to those enforcement proceedings, undertook other unilateral recovery measures, has no effect on the reply given.</p>

        </paragraph>

          <num>30</num>
          <content eId="para_13884__content">
            <p>Aside from the fact that initiating such measures in parallel to official enforcement proceedings through a bailiff is liable to mislead the debtor as to the nature of the procedure which he faces, the effectiveness of the protection provided to the consumer by the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive requires that the trader, which decided to act unilaterally in order to recover the debts, be subject to the provisions of that directive in respect of the measures which it adopts unilaterally, in parallel to enforcement proceedings.</p>

            <p>In the light of the foregoing, the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive must be interpreted as meaning that the legal relationship between a debt collection agency and a debtor, who has defaulted under a consumer credit agreement and whose debt has been assigned to that agency, falls within the material scope of that directive. The practices in which that agency engages in order to recover that debt fall within the concept of `product' within the meaning of Article 2(c) of the directive. In that regard, the fact that the existence of the debt was confirmed by a court decision, and that that decision was passed to a bailiff for enforcement, is without consequence.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Tenth Chamber) hereby rules: Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council ( `Unfair Commercial Practices Directive') must be interpreted as meaning that the legal relationship between a debt collection agency and the debtor, who has defaulted under a consumer credit agreement and whose debt has been assigned to that agency, falls within the material scope of the directive. The practices in which that agency engages in order to recover that debt fall within the concept of `product' within the meaning of Article 2(c) of that directive. In that regard, the fact that the existence of the debt was confirmed by a court decision, and that that decision was passed to a bailiff for enforcement, is without consequence.</p>
