            <p>Mercedes-Benz Financial Services UK, which is a subsidiary of Daimler AG and has its seat in the United Kingdom, offers three types of standard contract for financing the use of motor vehicles: a standard hire agreement known as `Leasing', a `Hire Purchase' agreement, and a leasing agreement with an option to purchase called `Agility', which combines certain features of the first two types of agreement and which allows customers to postpone choosing between leasing and purchase until after the vehicle has been handed over.</p>

            <p>Under the `Hire Purchase' agreement, the aggregate of the monthly payments made represents, as a rule, the total sale price of the vehicle, including the cost of financing. A modest additional fee ( `the option fee') must be paid in order to acquire ownership of the vehicle at the end of the contract. That final payment is provided for in the agreement and does not depend on the option being exercised. The option fee is debited from the customer's account at the same time as the last instalment, and the transfer of ownership is then complete. However, United Kingdom consumer protection legislation limits the amount which a seller can claim from a buyer under the terms of a hire purchase, and it is thus possible, in practice, for the customer to avoid making the final payment by terminating the contract prior to its expiry.</p>

          <content eId="para_16__content">
            <p>Under an `Agility' agreement, monthly instalments are, as a rule, lower than under a `Hire Purchase' agreement; total instalments thus represent only approximately 60% of the vehicle sale price, including the cost of financing. If the user wishes to exercise the option to purchase the vehicle, he must therefore pay approximately 40% of the sale price. That `balloon' payment represents the estimated average residual value of the vehicle at contract maturity. The customer is asked, three months before the end of the contract, whether he wishes to exercise the option. According to the findings of the referring court, around half of all lessees reply in the affirmative.</p>

            <p>With regard to VAT, it is not disputed that the `Leasing' agreement falls within the category of `supply of services' and, therefore, is subject to tax on each monthly instalment under Article 64 of the VAT Directive, the taxable amount being the amount of the monthly payment. Nor is it disputed that, conversely, the `Hire Purchase' agreement constitutes a `supply of goods' within the meaning of Article 14(2)(b) of the VAT Directive. Consequently, under Article 64 of that directive, VAT is chargeable in full upon the handing over of the vehicle, the taxable amount being the total price of the supply.</p>

            <p>As the Advocate General explained in points 22 and 23 of his Opinion, it is a particular feature of such agreements that they serve as a substitute for the immediate acquisition of full ownership, the lessee having the use of the goods without being required to pay the full purchase price for them when they are handed over to him.</p>

            <p>That type of contract may have features which are comparable to the acquisition of goods, or it may not, since it is open to the parties to provide that the lessee has the option of acquiring or not acquiring those goods at the end of the lease period (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 February 2012, Eon Aset Menidjmunt, C‑118/11, EU:C:2012:97, paragraphs 34 and 37).</p>

            <p>The fact that a transfer of ownership is provided for on the expiry of the contract or the fact that the present value of the lease payments is practically identical to the market value of the property constitute, separately or together, criteria which permit a determination of whether a contract can be categorised as a `finance lease' (see, to that effect, judgments of 16 February 2012, Eon Aset Menidjmunt, C‑118/11, EU:C:2012:97, paragraph 38, and of 2 July 2015, NLB Leasing, C‑209/14, EU:C:2015:440, paragraph 30).</p>

            <p>However, the classification of a contract as a `finance lease' is not, in itself, sufficient for the actual handing over of goods pursuant to that contract to be categorised as a transaction subject to VAT. In order for such a contract to be considered a `supply of goods' within the meaning of the VAT Directive, it is also necessary to determine whether the contract is a contract for `hire which provides that in the normal course of events ownership is to pass at the latest upon payment of the final instalment', within the meaning of Article 14(2)(b) of that directive.</p>

            <p>As is apparent from its actual wording, Article 14(2)(b) of the VAT Directive refers not to the transfer of the power to dispose of property as owner, as in paragraph 1 of that article, but, more explicitly, to the `passing of ownership' of that property.</p>

            <p>The only inference to be drawn from the words `in the normal course of events ownership is to pass at the latest upon payment of the final instalment' is that the final payment of sums to be paid by the lessee under the terms of the contract results by operation of law in the transfer to that lessee of ownership of the goods to which the agreement relates.</p>

            <p>As regards, in particular, the fact that the agreement includes a clause which, as in the case of the standard agreement at issue in the main proceedings, provides for the lessee to be able to exercise an option to purchase, it must be stated that the phrase `in the normal course of events' must be regarded as referring simply to the foreseeable performance of an agreement over its full term by the parties thereto, acting in good faith, in accordance with the principle that agreements must be kept.</p>

            <p>As the Advocate General noted in points 51 and 53 of his Opinion, this contractually determined outcome -- of ownership being transferred -- is incompatible with a genuine economic alternative for the lessee under which he may, at the appropriate time, opt either to acquire the goods, or to return them to the lessor, or to extend the lease, depending on his particular interests at the time when he is required to make that choice.</p>

            <p>The position would be different only if exercising the option to purchase, optional though it is in formal terms, appeared in fact, given the financial terms of the agreement, to be the only economically rational choice the lessee could make. That may in particular be the case where it is evident from the agreement that, when the possibility of exercising the option arises, the aggregate of the contractual instalments will correspond to the market value of the goods, including the cost of financing, and that the lessee will not be required, as a result of exercising the option, to pay a substantial additional sum.</p>
