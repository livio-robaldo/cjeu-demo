The price paid by company F, converted into the cif import price in accordance with Article 5(3) of Regulation No 2777/75, was in each case higher than the trigger price, which meant that no additional import duties covered by Regulations No 2777/75 and No 1484/95 were due.</p>

In those circumstances, on 10 September 2008, the Minister van Landbouw, Natuur en Voedselkwaliteit (Minister for Agriculture, Nature and Food Quality, `the Minister'), acting as the customs authority, issued a series of payment notices ( `tax notices I') sent, inter alia, to A, to claim, pursuant to Article 3(5) and Article 4 of Regulation No 1484/95, the payment of additional duties in respect of the imports covered by the declarations for release for free circulation at issue, and, for part of the products at issue, payment of the turnover tax.</p>

            <p>Following a supplementary inspection, the Netherlands customs authorities established that the purchases and sales of the products imported by company F were always carried out according to a specific scheme. Company G bought the products concerned from South American suppliers, at prices below the trigger price, and resold them to company K at prices well above the trigger price. The latter company sold the products at a price slightly higher than that which it had itself bought them from company F, which then imported those products with a view to their release for free circulation in the European Union. Company F then sold them to company G at an even higher price. Company G then sold them to company D at a price lower than both the price at which it had purchased them and the trigger price. Finally, company D sold the products to a customer at a price above the price at which it had bought them from company G, but was less than the price than company G had paid to company F, and less than the price paid by company F to company K on importing the products, and less than the trigger price.</p>

            <p>In view of those findings and the close links between companies D, F and G, the Netherlands customs authorities took the view that A had set up a chain of transactions with other operators whereby the initial price of the products covered by Regulation No 2777/75, purchased from South American independent suppliers, was artificially increased in subsequent transactions, so that the cif import price of the products in question was higher than the trigger price, in order to avoid payment of the additional duties referred to in Regulations No 2777/75 and No 1484/95. The Minister therefore was of the opinion that the purchase and sale agreements concluded between companies G and K, as well as between companies K and F, as well as the contracts concluded between the related companies D, F and G, involved fictitious transactions. Consequently, the Minister took the view that the price invoiced to G by the original South American suppliers was to be the basis for the calculation of the cif import price and any additional duties due.</p>

            <p>Where the cif import prices thus calculated were lower than the representative price taken into consideration when the tax notices I were issued, an additional amount of duties higher than that claimed in those notices was due for each of declarations submitted by company F. Taking the view that the customs debts at issue were incurred as a result of an incorrect declaration being lodged, within the meaning of Article 48(1) of the Customs Law, the Minister took the view that the additional duties due under Article 221(4) of the Customs Code, read in conjunction with Article 22e(1) of the AWR, could be claimed from the debtor after the expiry of the three years referred to in Article 221(3) of the Customs Code.</p>

Those notices, together with the tax notices I, were adopted on the basis of the second subparagraph of Article 201(3) of the Customs Code, read in conjunction with Article 54 of the Customs Decree, on the ground that the prices indicated in the declarations for release for free circulation submitted by company F came from invoices drawn up at A's request, whereas the latter had or ought reasonably to have known that the invoices were based on artificial transactions.</p>

The referring court, however, has doubts as to whether the failure by F to present those invoices amounts to providing the information `required to draw up the declaration ... false' within the meaning of the second subparagraph of Article 201(3) of the Customs Code.</p>

            <p>The referring court also raises the question of the interpretation of Article 221(4) of the Customs Code, as regards, more specifically, the question whether the Minister was entitled to issue the tax notices II more than three years after the importation of the products concerned. In that regard, the referring court observes that Article 221(4) of the Customs Code seems to apply only to situations in which the goods have been improperly introduced into the territory of the Union, as in the case of contraband, and not to situations such as that at issue in the main proceedings. In its view, it follows from that article, in a situation such as that at issue in the case in the main proceedings, that the customs debt is incurred when the customs declaration is lodged which is not an act liable to criminal prosecution.</p>

            <p>Finally, the referring court states that if the Court were to interpret Article 221(4) of the Customs Code in the sense that the extension of the limitation period under that article is not to be invoked where customs debts are incurred on the basis of Article 201 of the Customs Code, the question arises whether the issue of the tax notices II was lawful, since the three-year period from the date on which the customs debt was incurred had been suspended, pursuant to Article 221(3), following A's appeal being brought against the tax notices I. However, the referring court takes the view that it is necessary to determine whether, in accordance with that article, bringing an appeal allows the customs authorities, as long as the appeal is pending, to claim amounts additional to those claimed by the tax notice which is the subject of the appeal.</p>

            <p>Therefore, the answer to the first question is that, in circumstances such as those in the case in the main proceedings, the second subparagraph of Article 201(3) of the Customs Code must be interpreted as meaning that documents that are required to be produced pursuant to Article 3(2) of Regulation No 1484/95 constitute information required to draw up the customs declaration within the meaning of Article 201(3).</p>

            <p>43 By its second and third questions, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the second subparagraph of Article 201(3) of the Customs Code must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of a `debtor' of the customs debt, within the meaning of that article, covers a natural person who has been closely and knowingly involved in the design and artificial construction of a structure of commercial transactions which had the effect of reducing the amount of import duties legally owed, although, first, that natural person has not himself communicated the information which had served as the basis for drawing up the customs declaration and, second, he designed and implemented those transactions only after he had obtained the guarantee of the lawfulness of such transactions from customs law experts.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must, first of all, be borne in mind that, under the second subparagraph of Article 201(3) of the Customs Code, where a customs declaration in respect of one of the procedures for the customs schemes concerned, is drawn up on the basis of information which leads to all or part of the duties legally owed not being collected, the persons who provided the information required to draw up the declaration and who knew, or who ought reasonably to have known that such information was false, may also be considered debtors in accordance with the national provisions in force.</p>

            <p>It follows from Article 201(3) the information having served as the basis for drawing up a customs declaration must be regarded as being `false', within the meaning of that article, where it has led to all or part of the import duties legally owed not being collected.</p>

            <p>54 By its fourth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 221(4) of the Customs Code must be interpreted as meaning that, in circumstances such as those at issue in the case in the main proceedings, the fact that the customs debt on importation is incurred, in accordance with Article 201(1) thereof, through the release for free circulation of goods liable to import duties, is such as to exclude the possibility of communicating to the debtor the amount of import duties owed on such goods after the expiry of the period laid down in Article 221(3) of that code.</p>

            <p>First of all, it should be borne in mind that, pursuant to Article 201(1) of the Customs Code, a customs debt on importation is incurred, inter alia, on the release for free circulation of goods subject to import duties.</p>

            <p>In accordance with Article 221(3) of the Customs Code, communication of the amounts of the duties to the debtor is to take place after the expiry of a period of three years from the date on which the customs debt was incurred. Nevertheless, paragraph 4 of that article provides for the possibility, for the customs authorities, to communicate to the debtor the amount of the duties lawfully owed after the expiry of the three-year period, where the customs debt is the result of an act which is liable to give rise to criminal court proceedings.</p>

            <p>It follows from paragraph 40 of the present judgment that, in circumstances such as those in the case in the main proceedings, the additional duties imposed pursuant to Article 5 of Regulation No 2777/75 fall within the customs debt. Consequently, in so far as the fact of having supplied false information is the reason for the absence of collecting all or part of such additional duties, it must be considered that such a customs debt `is the result', within the meaning of Article 221(4) of the Customs Code, of the supply of such information.</p>

In circumstances such as those in the case in the main proceedings, the second subparagraph of Article 201(3) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 2700/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 November 2000 must be interpreted as meaning that documents that are required to be produced by Article 3(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1484/95 of 28 June 1995 laying down detailed rules for implementing the system of additional import duties and fixing representative prices in the poultrymeat and egg sectors and for egg albumin, and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 163/67/EEC, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 684/1999 of 29 March 1999, constitute information required to draw up the customs declaration within the meaning of Article 201(3). 2. Article 201(3) of Regulation No 2913/92, as amended by Regulation No 2700/2000, must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of a `debtor' of the customs debt, within the meaning of that article, covers the natural person who has been closely and knowingly involved in the design and artificial construction of a structure of commercial transactions, such as that at issue in the case in the main proceedings, which had the effect of reducing the amount of the import duties legally owed, although that natural person has not himself communicated the false information which had served as the basis for drawing up the customs declaration, where it appears from the facts that that person had or ought reasonably to have known that the transactions concerned by that structure had been carried out not in the ordinary course of trade, but solely for the purpose of improperly benefiting from the advantages provided for by Union law.
