            <p>While questioning whether to classify the circumstances which gave rise to the disputes brought before it as `extraordinary circumstances', in so far as those situations concern rates of absenteeism which are not typical of the normal activity of an air carrier, but occur, as contended by the defendant in the main proceedings, inter alia in cases of `wildcat strikes' or of a call by staff members themselves for a boycott, that court nonetheless takes the view that it must be concluded in the present case that there were no `extraordinary circumstances'.</p>

            <p>On the one hand, the referring court notes that the air carrier in question in the main proceedings may have contributed to the rate of absenteeism by announcing measures to restructure the undertaking. On the other, while the majority of the German courts accept that both internal and external strikes constitute `extraordinary circumstances', in the dispute before the Amtsgericht Hannover (Local Court, Hanover), the absence of staff resulted from an appeal to some of the staff members of the air carrier concerned to go on sick leave, and was not formally issued by a trade union. Such a social movement can therefore be distinguished from an official strike and should be treated as a `wildcat strike', which is not covered by freedom of association.</p>

            <p>In Case C‑292/17, the referring court, the Amtsgericht Düsseldorf (Local Court, Düsseldorf, Germany) notes that, in the judgment of 4 October 2012, Finnair ( C‑22/11, EU:C:2012:604), the Court did indeed hold that denying boarding to a passenger on a flight not affected by a strike, while allowing another passenger whose prior flight was affected by a strike to board, gave rise to an obligation to pay compensation. However, that judgment is not necessarily transposable to flight cancellations, in so far as Regulation No 261/2004 does not entitle the air carrier to rely on `extraordinary circumstances' in order to avoid its liability to pay compensation in the event of denied boarding.</p>

            <p>That court notes, however, that Article 5(3) of the basic regulation requires that the cancellation of the flight in question occurs on account of `extraordinary circumstances' and, accordingly, that there is a causal link between that circumstance and that cancellation. However, the cancellation of a flight on account not of absences due to illness, but of an operating air carrier's decision to reorganise all flights in the light of that circumstance does not make it possible to attribute the cancellation of that flight directly to that circumstance. Such an interpretation of Article 5(3) of that regulation could rely on recital 15 thereof, according to which `extraordinary circumstances' must have affected a specific flight.</p>

The third question is unconnected with the subject matter of the disputes in the main proceedings, inasmuch as TUIfly did not establish new timetables for `economic reasons specific to the undertaking', but merely reorganised its flights without regard to the costs or even to such economic reasons.

            <p>Making a distinction between strikes which, under applicable national law, are legal from those which are not in order to determine whether they should be classified as `extraordinary circumstances' within the meaning of Article 5(3) of Regulation No 261/2004 would make the right to compensation of passengers dependent on the social legislation specific to each Member State, thereby undermining the objectives of Regulation No 261/2004, referred to in recitals 1 and 4, in order to ensure a high level of protection for passengers as well as equivalent conditions for the exercise of the activities of air carriers on the territory of the European Union.</p>

            <p>In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the first two questions in Cases C‑195/17, C‑197/17 to C‑203/17, C‑226/17, C‑228/17, C‑274/17, C‑275/17, C‑278/17, C‑286/17 to C‑290/17 and C‑291/17 and to the questions in Case C‑292/17 is that Article 5(3) of Regulation No 261/2004, read in the light of recital 14 thereof, must be interpreted as meaning that the spontaneous absence of a significant part of the flight crew staff ( `wildcat strikes'), such as that at issue in the disputes in the main proceedings, which stems from the surprise announcement by an operating air carrier of a restructuring of the undertaking, following a call echoed not by the staff representatives of the company but spontaneously by the workers themselves who placed themselves on sick leave, is not covered by the concept of `extraordinary circumstances' within the meaning of that provision.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules: Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 295/91, read in the light of recital 14 thereof, must be interpreted as meaning that the spontaneous absence of a significant part of the flight crew staff ( `wildcat strikes'), such as that at issue in the disputes in the main proceedings, which stems from the surprise announcement by an operating air carrier of a restructuring of the undertaking, following a call echoed not by the staff representatives of the company but spontaneously by the workers themselves who placed themselves on sick leave, is not covered by the concept of `extraordinary circumstances' within the meaning of that provision.</p>
