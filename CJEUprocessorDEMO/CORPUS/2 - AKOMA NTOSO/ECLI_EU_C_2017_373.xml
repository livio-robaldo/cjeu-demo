There is a tremendous development of the mobility of taxpayers, of the number of cross-border transactions and of the internationalisation of financial instruments, which makes it difficult for Member States to assess taxes due properly. This increasing difficulty affects the functioning of taxation systems and entails double taxation, which itself incites tax fraud and tax evasion ...</p>

                <p>... In order to overcome the negative effects of this phenomenon, it is indispensable to develop new administrative cooperation between the Member States' tax administrations. There is a need for instruments likely to create confidence between Member States, by setting up the same rules, obligations and rights for all Member States. ...</p>

                <p>Member States should exchange information concerning particular cases where requested by another Member State and should make the necessary enquiries to obtain such information. The standard of ``foreseeable relevance '' is intended to provide for exchange of information in tax matters to the widest possible extent and, at the same time, to clarify that Member States are not at liberty to engage in ``fishing expeditions '' or to request information that is unlikely to be relevant to the tax affairs of a given taxpayer. While Article 20 of this Directive contains procedural requirements, those provisions need to be interpreted liberally in order not to frustrate the effective exchange of information. ...</p>

            <p>Several governments submitted that, in a case such as that in the main proceedings, there was no `[right] guaranteed by the law of the Union' within the meaning of Article 47 of the Charter because Directive 2011/16 does not confer any rights on individuals. According to those governments, like Directive 77/799, which the Court examined in its judgment of 22 October 2013, Sabou ( C‑276/12, EU:C:2013:678), Directive 2011/16 covers only the exchange of information between tax administrations and confers rights only on them. Accordingly, a relevant person such as Berlioz could not claim on the basis of Article 47 of the Charter that it has a right to an effective remedy.</p>

            <p>The Court held, in paragraphs 30 to 36 of that judgment, that Directive 77/799, the purpose of which is to govern cooperation between the tax authorities of Member States, coordinates the transfer of information between competent authorities by imposing certain obligations on the Member States, but does not confer specific rights on the taxpayer as regards his participation in the procedure for the exchange of information between those authorities. In particular, that directive does not impose any obligation for those authorities to give the taxpayer a hearing.</p>

            <p>For its part, Directive 2011/16 states, in recital 7, that it builds on the achievements of Directive 77/799 by providing for clearer and more precise rules governing administrative cooperation between Member States where necessary, in order to broaden the scope of such cooperation. It must be noted that, in so doing, Directive 2011/16 pursues a similar objective to that of Directive 77/799, which it replaces.</p>

Since that penalty was based on a national provision which, as is evident from the answer to the first question, implements EU law within the meaning of Article 51(1) of the Charter, it follows that the provisions of the Charter, in particular Article 47 thereof, are applicable to the facts of the dispute in the main proceedings (see, to that effect, judgment of 26 September 2013, Texdata Software, C‑418/11, EU:C:2013:588, paragraphs 74 to 77).</p>

            <p>It should be noted in that regard that the principle of effective judicial protection is a general principle of EU law, which is now set out in Article 47 of the Charter.

It is necessary, therefore, to refer only to Article 47 (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 November 2012, Otis and Others, C‑199/11, EU:C:2012:684, paragraphs 46 and 47).</p>

It follows, according to the Commission, from paragraph 40 of the judgment of 22 October 2013, Sabou ( C‑276/12, EU:C:2013:678), that a request for information that is sent to a taxpayer, which is part of the investigation stage during which information is collected, is a measure that is merely preparatory to the final decision and could not be challenged.</p>

The latter case concerned requests for information sent by the tax administration of one Member State to the tax administration of another Member State and, in particular, the right for the taxpayer who was the subject of a tax investigation in the requesting Member State to participate in the procedure relating to those requests. No request for information had, however, been sent to the relevant person, unlike in the case of Berlioz in the main proceedings. Thus, in the case that led to that judgment, the Court was called upon to determine whether the taxpayer who was the subject of requests for information as between national tax administrations had a right to be heard in that process, and not, as in the present case, whether a relevant person in the requested Member State has a right to a remedy against a penalty imposed on him for failure to comply with an information order issued to him by the requested authority following a request for information sent to that authority by the requesting authority.</p>

According to the commentary on that article adopted by the OECD Council on 17 July 2012, Contracting States are not at liberty `to engage in fishing expeditions', nor to request information that is unlikely to be relevant to the tax affairs of a given taxpayer. On the contrary, there must be a reasonable possibility that the requested information will be relevant.</p>

Secondly, it asks whether Article 1(1) and Article 5 of Directive 2011/16 and Article 47 of the Charter must be interpreted as precluding the requested authority's examination of the validity of a request for information issued by the requesting authority from being limited to the procedural regularity of such a request, and as requiring the national court, in such an action, to verify that the condition of foreseeable relevance has been satisfied in all its aspects, including in the light of Article 17 of Directive 2011/16.</p>

            <p>If the judicial review guaranteed by Article 47 of the Charter is to be effective, the reasons given by the requesting authority must put the national court in a position in which it may carry out the review of the legality of the request for information (see, to that effect, judgments of 4 June 2013, ZZ, C‑300/11, EU:C:2013:363, paragraph 53, and of 23 October 2014, Unitrading, C‑437/13, EU:C:2014:2318, paragraph 20).</p>

            <p>It must be noted that those provisions which, as far as some of them are concerned, could be taken into account in determining the legality of a request for information to the relevant person, do not have any bearing on a review of the foreseeable relevance of that information. As is evident from the request for a preliminary ruling and from the written and oral observations submitted by Berlioz, its refusal to communicate some of the information requested is based solely on the claim that that information has no foreseeable relevance, not on any reliance on a `limit' within the meaning of Article 17 of Directive 2011/16.</p>

            <p>Consequently, the answer to the third and fifth questions is that Article 1(1) and Article 5 of Directive 2011/16 must be interpreted as meaning that verification by the requested authority to which a request for information has been submitted by the requesting authority pursuant to that directive is not limited to the procedural regularity of that request but must enable the requested authority to satisfy itself that the information sought is not devoid of any foreseeable relevance having regard to the identity of the taxpayer concerned and that of any third party asked to provide the information, and to the requirements of the tax investigation concerned. Those provisions of Directive 2011/16 and Article 47 of the Charter must be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of an action brought by a relevant person against a penalty imposed on that person by the requested authority for non-compliance with an information order issued by that authority in response to a request for information sent by the requesting authority pursuant to Directive 2011/16, the national court not only has jurisdiction to vary the penalty imposed but also has jurisdiction to review the legality of that information order. As regards the condition of legality of that information order, which relates to the foreseeable relevance of the requested information, the courts' review is limited to verification that the requested information manifestly has no such relevance.</p>

            <p>90 By its sixth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the second paragraph of Article 47 of the Charter must be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of a judicial review by a court of the requested Member State, that court must have access to the request for information addressed to the requested Member State by the requesting Member State, and whether that document must also be communicated to the relevant person in the latter Member State, so that his case can be given a fair hearing, or whether he may be refused access on grounds of confidentiality.</p>

However, if the court of the requested Member State considers that that minimum information is not sufficient in that respect, and if it asks the requested authority for additional information as referred to in paragraph 92 of the present judgment, that court is obliged to provide that additional information to the relevant person, while taking due account of the possible confidentiality of some of that information.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 51(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must be interpreted as meaning that a Member State implements EU law within the meaning of that provision, and that the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union is therefore applicable, when that Member State makes provision in its legislation for a pecuniary penalty to be imposed on a person who may be the subject of administrative measures (a `relevant person') who refuses to supply information in the context of an exchange between tax authorities based, in particular, on the provisions of Council Directive 2011/16/EU of 15 February 2011 on administrative cooperation in the field of taxation and repealing Directive 77/799/EEC. 2. Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must be interpreted as meaning that a relevant person on whom a pecuniary penalty has been imposed for failure to comply with an administrative decision directing that person to provide information ( `information order') in the context of an exchange between national tax administrations pursuant to Directive 2011/16 is entitled to challenge the legality of that decision. 3. Article 1(1) and Article 5 of Directive 2011/16 must be interpreted as meaning that the `foreseeable relevance' of the information requested by one Member State from another Member State is a condition which the request for information must satisfy in order for the requested Member State to be required to comply with that request, and thus a condition of the legality of the information order addressed by that Member State to a relevant person and of the penalty imposed on that person for failure to comply with that information order. 4. Article 1(1) and Article 5 of Directive 2011/16 must be interpreted as meaning that verification by the requested authority to which a request for information has been submitted by the requesting authority pursuant to that directive is not limited to the procedural regularity of that request but must enable the requested authority to satisfy itself that the information sought is not devoid of any foreseeable relevance having regard to the identity of the taxpayer concerned and that of any third party asked to provide the information, and to the requirements of the tax investigation concerned. Those provisions of Directive 2011/16 and Article 47 of the Charter must be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of an action brought by a relevant person against a penalty imposed on that person by the requested authority for non-compliance with an information order issued by that authority in response to a request for information sent by the requesting authority pursuant to Directive 2011/16, the national court not only has jurisdiction to vary the penalty imposed but also has jurisdiction to review the legality of that information order. As regards the condition of legality of that information order, which relates to the foreseeable relevance of the requested information, the courts' review is limited to verification that the requested information manifestly has no such relevance. 5. The second paragraph of Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of a judicial review by a court of the requested Member State, that court must have access to the request for information addressed to the requested Member State by the requesting Member State. The relevant person does not, however, have a right of access to the whole of that request for information, which is to remain a secret document in accordance with Article 16 of Directive 2011/16. In order for that person to be given a full hearing of his case in relation to the lack of any foreseeable relevance of the requested information, it is sufficient, in principle, that he be in possession of the information referred to in Article 20(2) of that directive.</p>
