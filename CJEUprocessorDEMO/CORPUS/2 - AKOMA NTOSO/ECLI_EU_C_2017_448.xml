            <p>Among the conditions attached to the financial assistance, set out in the Memorandum of Understanding, point 5(a) thereof requires a reduction of the public sector wage bill, while the fourth subparagraph of point 5(b) states that, in order to improve the long-term sustainability of the public finances, the key parameters of the pension system are to be reformed.</p>

            <p>It must therefore be held that the purpose of the measure at issue in the main proceedings, which simultaneously pursues the two objectives referred to in the previous paragraph of the present judgment, is to implement the undertakings given by Romania in the Memorandum of Understanding, which is part of EU law.</p>

            <p>It is true that the Memorandum of Understanding leaves Romania some discretion in deciding what measures are most likely to lead to performance of those undertakings. However, on the one hand, where a Member State adopts measures in the exercise of the discretion conferred upon it by an act of EU law, it must be regarded as implementing that law, within the meaning of Article 51(1) of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 December 2011, N. S. and Others, C‑411/10 and C‑493/10, EU:C:2011:865, paragraphs 65 to 68). On the other hand, the objectives set out in Article 3(5) of Decision 2009/459, as well as those set out in the Memorandum of Understanding, are sufficiently detailed and precise to permit the inference that the purpose of the prohibition on combining a public-sector retirement pension with income from activities carried out in public institutions, stemming from Law No 329/2009, is to implement both the memorandum and that decision, and thus EU law, within the meaning of Article 51(1) of the Charter. Consequently, the latter is applicable to the dispute in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, it is necessary to examine whether Article 17 of the Charter, in particular paragraph 1 thereof, precludes national legislation such as that at issue in the case in the main proceedings. In order to determine the scope of the fundamental right to peaceful enjoyment of property, it is necessary, having regard to Article 52(3) of the Charter, to take account of Article 1 of Protocol No 1 to the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed in Rome on 4 November 1950, which enshrines that right (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 September 2008, Kadi and Al Barakaat International Foundation v Council and Commission, C‑402/05 P and C‑415/05 P, EU:C:2008:461, paragraph 356).</p>

          <content eId="para_9324__content">
            <p>In that regard, where legislation provides for the automatic payment of a social benefit, it generates a proprietary interest for persons meeting the requirements thereof falling within the ambit of Article 1 of Protocol No 1 to that convention (ECtHR, 7 July 2011, Stummer v. Austria, CE:ECHR:2011:0707JUD003745202, § 82). The rights resulting from the payment of contributions to a social security scheme thus constitute rights of property for the purposes of that article (ECtHR, 12 October 2004, Kjartan Ásmundsson v. Iceland, CE:ECHR:2004:1012JUD006066900, § 39). However, the right to property enshrined in that article cannot be interpreted as entitling a person to a pension of a particular amount (ECtHR, 12 October 2004, Kjartan Ásmundsson v. Iceland, CE:ECHR:2004:1012JUD006066900, § 39).</p>

            <p>With regard to Article 17 of the Charter, it is clear from the settled case-law of the Court that the right of property enshrined in that article is not absolute and that its exercise may be subject to restrictions justified by objectives of general interest pursued by the European Union (see, to that effect, judgment of 20 September 2016, Ledra Advertising and Others v Commission and ECB, Joined Cases C‑8/15 P to C‑10/15 P, EU:C:2016:701, paragraph 69 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the case in the main proceedings, the national measure at issue does not, admittedly, entail an outright deprivation of the right to a pension of the persons in the situation of the applicants in the main proceedings in so far as they may continue to receive their pension if they relinquish the parallel pursuit of a paid professional activity with a public institution. However, such a measure restricts the use and enjoyment of the pension entitlement of the persons concerned, in that it entails a suspension of the payment of their pension when they have opted, instead, to pursue such an activity.</p>

            <p>It should first be noted that Article 52(1) of the Charter provides that any limitation on the exercise of the rights and freedoms recognised by the Charter must be provided for by law and must respect the essence of those rights and freedoms. In observance of the principle of proportionality, restrictions may be imposed on the exercise of those rights and freedoms only if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the European Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>

            <p>It is therefore necessary to determine whether the restriction of the right to property, resulting from the prohibition laid down by Law No 329/2009 on the combining of a net public-sector retirement pension with income from an activity carried out in a public institution, is consistent with the essential content of the right to property, whether it fulfils an objective of general interest, and whether it is necessary for that purpose.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be observed, first of all, that, as is apparent from the wording of Article 2 of Law No 329/2009, that law is of an exceptional nature and is intended to be temporary. In addition, it does not call into question the very principle of the right to a pension, but restricts its exercise in well-defined and limited circumstances, namely, when the pension is combined with a professional activity carried out in public institutions and when the amount of the pension exceeds a certain threshold. Thus, Law No 329/2009 is consistent with the essential content of the right to property enjoyed by the applicants in the main proceedings in respect of the pensions in question, as noted by the Advocate General in point 83 of his Opinion.</p>

            <p>Next, it should be noted that the purpose of Law 329/2009 is to rationalise public spending in an exceptional context of global financial and economic crisis (see, to that effect, judgment of the ECtHR, 20 March 2012, Ionel Panlife v. Romania, CE:ECHR:2012:0320DEC001390211, § 21). As regards, in particular, the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings, it aims to achieve both the objective of reducing public sector wage costs and that of reforming the pension system, which were laid down by Decision 2009/459 and by the Memorandum of Understanding with a view to reducing the balance of payments difficulties that led Romania to seek and to obtain financial assistance from the European Union. Such objectives are objectives of general interest.</p>

            <p>As regards the suitability and necessity of the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings, it must be borne in mind that, given the particular economic context, Member States have broad discretion when adopting economic decisions and are in the best position to determine the measures likely to achieve the objective pursued.</p>

            <p>Moreover, Law No 329/2009 does not impose a disproportionate and excessive burden on the persons concerned by the prohibition on combining a retirement pension with income from an activity carried out in a public institution given that, on the one hand, they have to choose between the payment of their pension or of that income only where the amount of their pension exceeds the national average gross wage which was the basis for drawing up the State's social security budget, and that, on the other, they may at any time decide to terminate their employment relationship and receive their pension again, as noted by the Advocate General in point 86 of his Opinion.</p>

            <p>In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the sixth, seventh, ninth and tenth questions must be that Article 6 TEU and Article 17(1) of the Charter must be interpreted as meaning that they do not preclude national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which prohibits the combining of a net public-sector retirement pension with income from activities carried out in public institutions if the amount of the pension exceeds a certain threshold.</p>
