The additions and clarifications concerned, in particular, the field of application of the protection provided for by the agreement, which it was proposed to extend to geographical indications (Articles 2 and 9), the substantive scope of that protection and the procedural means for implementing it (Articles 4 to 8 and 11 to 20), and the possibility given to intergovernmental organisations of acceding to the agreement (Article 28).</p>

            <p>The Commission and the Parliament state, first of all, that the exclusive competence conferred on the European Union by Article 3(1) TFEU in the field of the common commercial policy includes, in accordance with Article 207(1) TFEU, the commercial aspects of intellectual property. On that basis, the European Union has sole competence to negotiate and conclude international agreements concerning intellectual property where it is established, having regard to their aim and content, that they display a specific link with international trade, for example, by facilitating international trade by means of the uniformisation of rules. Consequently, that exclusive competence, far from being restricted to agreements relating to the harmonisation of the protection of intellectual property rights which are negotiated in the context of the World Trade Organisation (WTO), extends, in particular, to other agreements which, when assessed individually, clearly have the principal objective of facilitating, on a reciprocal basis, trade in goods or services with third countries by affording such goods or services a similar degree of protection to that which they already enjoy within the internal market.</p>

          <content eId="para_1604__content">
            <p>Next, the Commission and the Parliament contend that, in the present case, the draft revised agreement, like the Lisbon Agreement, displays a specific link with international trade. It is true that the draft has no preamble expressly stating its aim. However, it is clear from an analysis of its provisions and its context that it has the aim and effect of providing, for the appellations of origin and geographical indications of each contracting party, a system of international registration which ensures their legal protection, on the territory of all the contracting parties, against the risk that they might be used in such a way as to undermine their integrity or their reputation and thus that the marketing abroad of the corresponding products might be prejudiced. In so doing, the draft revised agreement improves the protection of exports of those products from the European Union to third countries, protection which would otherwise depend on country-by-country registration and thus on variable legal guarantees. Consequently, a draft of that nature falls within the exclusive competence of the European Union in the field of the common commercial policy, even if the system of protection which it proposes to introduce is intended to be implemented by the authorities of the Member States, in accordance with Article 291(1) TFEU. Furthermore, the European Union has already concluded by itself, on the basis of Article 207 TFEU, a number of international agreements relating to the protection of appellations of origin and geographical indications, and the Council, which has not disputed the existence of that practice, has given no reasons to explain its departure from it in the present case.</p>

          <content eId="para_1605__content">
            <p>Accordingly, the Commission and the Parliament submit, finally, that the Council erred in law in taking the view that the draft revised agreement fell within the approximation of laws in the field of the internal market, for the purposes of Article 114 TFEU, and, therefore, within a competence shared between the European Union and its Member States. In this respect, the Council has wrongly drawn a parallel between the external and internal competences of the European Union. The European Union's competence to negotiate the draft revised agreement may arise from the common commercial policy even though the common rules of the European Union for the protection of appellations of origin and geographical indications are, for their part, based on the common agricultural policy and on the approximation of the laws of the Member States and even though the relevant competences of the European Union have to date been exercised only in relation to appellations of origin and geographical indications for agricultural products, rather than non-agricultural products.</p>

            <p>The Council and all the intervening Member States contend that the draft revised agreement does not fall within the field of the common commercial policy and that the European Union therefore does not have, on that basis, exclusive competence to negotiate it.</p>

            <p>In that regard, they submit, in essence, that, in order for an international agreement which is intended to be negotiated in a context other than that of the WTO and which relates to intellectual property matters other than those covered by the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights -- which constitutes Annex 1C to the Agreement establishing the WTO signed in Marrakesh on 15 April 1994 and approved by Council Decision 94/800/EC of 22 December 1994 concerning the conclusion on behalf of the European Community, as regards matters within its competence, of the agreements reached in the Uruguay Round multilateral negotiations (1986-1994) ( OJ 1994 L 336, p. 1) -- to be regarded as addressing commercial aspects of intellectual property, within the meaning of Article 207(1) TFEU, it is necessary for the agreement to display a specific link with international trade.</p>

          <content eId="para_1608__content">
            <p>However, in the present case, the context of the draft revised agreement does not support the conclusion that it displays such a specific link. First of all, it is administered by WIPO, and it is apparent from the convention establishing that organisation that the first objective of the latter is to promote the development of measures designed to facilitate the efficient protection of intellectual property and to harmonise national legislation in that field. Next, the objective of the draft revised agreement itself is not to facilitate trade by extending the reach of EU rules to third countries, but, as is the case with the common rules concerning appellations of origin and geographical indications adopted by the European Union on the basis of Article 114 TFEU, to establish a mechanism for protecting traditional products and providing information to consumers that applies to all contracting parties, including the European Union should it accede to the agreement. Finally, analysis of the content of the draft revised agreement confirms that the latter falls within the area of competence covered by Article 114 TFEU since its purpose is to establish a uniform procedural framework for the protection of appellations of origin and geographical indications, and that it is only secondarily and indirectly that the establishment of that procedural framework is capable of affecting trade in goods that benefit from such appellations and indications.</p>

            <p>In any event, the Council contends that, if the Court were to consider Article 207 TFEU to be the appropriate substantive legal basis for the contested decision, and not Article 114 TFEU, the mistaken reference to the latter provision should be regarded as a formal defect that cannot warrant the annulment of that decision. In either event, the Council correctly referred to Article 218 TFEU as the procedural legal basis for the contested decision and complied with the corresponding procedural requirements by adopting that decision by a qualified majority.</p>

            <p>In that regard, the system of reciprocal protection of appellations of origin and geographical indications which the draft revised agreement envisages is based, in essence, on three series of provisions.</p>

            <p>First of all, each contracting party is obliged to establish a body of rules of substantive law preventing appellations of origin and geographical indications that are already protected on the territory of one of the other contracting parties both from being the subject of uses that are likely to damage the interests of their holders or to be detrimental to the reputation of the products that benefit from that protection (Article 11), and from becoming generic (Article 12).</p>

            <p>Next, each contracting party is obliged to establish, in its legal order, rules of procedural law enabling any interested natural or legal person to secure, from the competent administrative and judicial authorities, observance of the protection which the draft revised agreement affords to those appellations of origin and geographical indications, and to bring legal proceedings, or to have legal proceedings brought, against persons alleged to have infringed them (Article 14).</p>

            <p>Finally, the draft revised agreement enables the holders of those appellations of origin and geographical indications to invoke the protection afforded by the various provisions referred to in the preceding two paragraphs of the present judgment, as a result of a mechanism providing for a single registration that is valid throughout the Special Union established by the Lisbon Agreement (Articles 5 to 8).</p>

            <p>In view of that single registration mechanism, the international agreement which the draft revised agreement presages will have the direct and immediate effect of altering the conditions under which trade between the European Union and the other parties to that international agreement is organised, by dispensing manufacturers participating in that trade from the obligation that they currently face, in order to address the legal and economic risks associated with such trade, of having to lodge an application for registration of the appellations of origin and geographical indications that they use with the competent authorities of each of the contracting parties.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the provisions described in paragraphs 67 and 68 of the present judgment will have direct and immediate effects on trade between the European Union and the third States concerned, by giving all those manufacturers, and any other interested natural or legal person, the necessary tools to secure, under homogeneous substantive and procedural conditions, effective observance of the protection which the draft revised agreement affords to their industrial property rights if appellations of origin or geographical indications are used abroad in a harmful or unfair manner.</p>

            <p>That assessment of the effects of the draft revised agreement is supported by the analysis which led the Court to hold that, in the light of the key role that the protection of intellectual property rights plays in trade in goods and services in general, and in combatting unlawful trade in particular, a draft international agreement providing for the establishment of a registration mechanism for geographical indications of the contracting parties and of a system of reciprocal protection of those indications against acts of unfair competition, which were analogous to those at issue in the present case, was such as to have direct and immediate effects on international trade (Opinion 2/15(Free Trade Agreement with Singapore) of 16 May 2017, EU:C:2017:376, paragraph 127).</p>

            <p>That being so, the effects of the draft revised agreement on trade between the European Union and the third States that will accede to it meet the requirements of the case-law that is recalled in paragraph 65 of the present judgment.</p>

          <content eId="para_1639__content">
            <p>It thus follows from the examination of the draft revised agreement, first, that it is essentially intended to facilitate and govern trade between the European Union and third States and, secondly, that it is such as to have direct and immediate effects on such trade, so that its negotiation falls within the exclusive competence which Article 3(1) TFEU confers on the European Union in the field of the common commercial policy envisaged in Article 207(1) TFEU.</p>

            <p>Therefore, the Council was wrong in taking the view that the contested decision fell within the approximation of laws in the field of the internal market and, accordingly, within a competence shared between the European Union and its Member States, and in basing that decision on Article 114 TFEU and Article 218(3) and (4) TFEU.</p>

            <p>Contrary to the Council's contentions, that error cannot be regarded as a mere formal defect.
