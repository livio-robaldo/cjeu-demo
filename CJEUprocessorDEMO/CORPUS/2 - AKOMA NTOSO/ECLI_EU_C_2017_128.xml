It is apparent from the order for reference that, in the course of its involvement during the period 1998 to 2008, that notified body made eight visits to the manufacturer's premises, all of which were announced in advance.

            <p>Taking the view that TÜV Rheinland had not fulfilled its obligations satisfactorily, Mrs Schmitt claimed EUR 40000 by way of compensation for non-material damage from that notified body before the German courts. She also sought a declaration that that body was liable for any future material damage. In support of her claims, Mrs Schmitt argued that an inspection of the delivery notes and invoices would have enabled TÜV Rheinland to ascertain that the manufacturer had not used an approved form of silicone.</p>

            <p>First, the appeal court found that there could be no liability on the part of TÜV Rheinland for infringement of an obligation under a contract for the benefit of third parties, as the contract concluded between the notified body and the manufacturer fell to be assessed exclusively by reference to private law and did not include Mrs Schmitt. According to that court, it is neither the purpose nor the intention of TÜV Rheinland's involvement to protect third parties, as the activities connected with certification serve only to ensure compliance with the requirements for placing medical devices on the market. The inclusion of a third party within the scope of the contract, contrary to the intention of the parties to the contract and in the absence of any legitimate interest in that regard, would have the effect of extending the notified body's liability indefinitely.</p>

            <p>The referring court has indicated that the answer to the question whether the first sentence of Paragraph 6(2) of the MPG is to be regarded as a provision conferring legal protection on individual interests depends essentially on the content and purpose of Directive 93/42 in general, and Annex II thereto in particular. Under German law, a provision should be regarded as conferring legal protection where, having regard to its purpose and content, it is intended to protect individuals or certain groups of persons against the infringement of a particular legal interest. It would be helpful in that regard to ascertain whether the legislature which adopted the provision in question specifically intended, if only as a secondary aim, to afford to certain groups of individuals the legal protection sought on account of the infringement alleged. It is also appropriate to ascertain, as part of a comprehensive assessment of the legislative context in which the provision in question applies, whether the legislature might have intended to make infringement of the protected interest result in the tortious liability of the party infringing that interest.</p>

In interpreting that contract in accordance with German law, the objectives pursued by Directive 93/42 in general through the conformity assessment procedure and, in particular, through the involvement of the notified body via that contract are of crucial importance.</p>

            <p>It should be noted in that regard that some of the obligations the notified body is under pursuant to Annex II to Directive 93/42 are undoubtedly specific in terms of specific action to be taken. Thus, in auditing the manufacturer's quality system, the notified body is required to carry out an inspection on the manufacturer's premises, in accordance with Section 3.3 of that annex. Moreover, in carrying out `surveillance' of the manufacturer's activities, the notified body must periodically undertake appropriate inspections and assessments, in accordance with Section 5.3 of the annex.</p>

However, the obligations laid down in Article 16(6) of the directive and those set out in paragraph 41 above would be a dead letter if the degree of discretion knew no limits. The notified body would not be able to fulfil its function under the procedure relating to the EC declaration of conformity if it were free not to take any steps in the face of evidence indicating that a medical device might not comply with the requirements laid down in Directive 93/42.</p>

            <p>49 By its first question, the referring court seeks to ascertain, in essence, whether Directive 93/42 is to be interpreted as meaning, first, that in the procedure relating to the EC declaration of conformity, the purpose of the notified body's involvement is to protect the end users of medical devices and, second, that a culpable failure by that body to comply with its obligations is therefore liable to give rise to liability on its part vis-à-vis such users.</p>

          <content eId="para_1563__content">
            <p>It should be observed that the Court has previously held, on the basis of, inter alia, the third and fifth recitals of Directive 93/42, that the aim of the directive is not only the protection of health stricto sensu, but also the safety of persons and that it does not concern only patients and users of medical devices but, more generally, `third parties' or `other persons' (judgment of 19 November 2009, Nordiska Dental, C‑288/08, EU:C:2009:718, paragraph 29). It follows that the actual aim of that directive is to protect the end users of medical devices.</p>

            <p>While it is incumbent on the manufacturer, in the first place, to ensure that the medical device complies with the requirements laid down in Directive 93/42, it is clear that that directive also imposes obligations to that end on the Member States and notified bodies.</p>

As the Court held in paragraphs 35 to 38 of its judgment of 24 November 2016, Lohmann &amp; Rauscher International ( C‑662/15, EU:C:2016:903), the combination of those obligations in connection with the procedures for safeguarding, vigilance and health surveillance, all of which are laid down by the directive, ensures protection for the health and safety of persons.</p>
