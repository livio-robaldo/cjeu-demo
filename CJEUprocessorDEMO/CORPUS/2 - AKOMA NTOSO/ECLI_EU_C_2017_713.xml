The General Court held that, having regard, in particular, to the fact that the 2002 decision contained no reference to Article 3 or Article 15(2) of Regulation No 17, the decision was based on Article 65(4) and (5) CS alone ... Since those provisions had expired on 23 July 2002, the Commission could no longer derive competence from those provisions, which were no longer in force when it adopted the 2002 decision, in order to establish an infringement of Article 65(1) CS and to impose fines on the undertakings which had allegedly participated in the infringement ...</p>

            <p>In the decision of 30 September 2009, the Commission considered, inter alia, that Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles [101 and 102 TFEU] ( OJ 2003 L 1, p. 1), was to be interpreted as empowering it to establish and sanction, after 23 July 2002, cartels in the sectors which fell within the scope of the ECSC Treaty ratione materiae and ratione temporis. It stated that the decision had been adopted in conformity with the procedural rules of the EC Treaty as well as the aforementioned regulation, and that the material provisions that were no longer in force at the date of adoption of an act could be applied under the principles governing the temporal succession of rules, subject to application of the principle lex mitior.</p>

The grounds allege; first, an error of law as well as an inadequate statement of reasons and contradictory reasoning in the judgment under appeal regarding the assessment of whether there had been an infringement of Regulation No 773/2004 and the rights of defence; second, an error of law as well as an inadequate statement of reasons and contradictory reasoning regarding the determination of the final amount of the fine; third, a contradiction and an error in law in so far as the General Court classed Riva as a `participant' in the agreement concluded in December 1998 on sales quotas and, as a result, took into account that part of the cartel to determine the amount of the fine; and, fourth, failure to provide a statement of reasons for the impact of the involvement of Riva's directors on the increase in the starting amount of the fine. Riva also asks the Court for an incidental ruling on the unlawfulness of the proceedings before the General Court on account of infringement of the right to legal process within a reasonable period.</p>

            <p>By its first ground of appeal, Riva seeks, in essence, to contest the General Court's findings, in paragraph 124 of the judgment under appeal, dismissing Riva's argument that the Commission should have sent a new statement of objections and held a hearing in the presence of the representatives of the Member States following the annulment of the 2002 decision, before adopting the decision at issue.</p>

            <p>Riva claims that the General Court cannot base its reasoning in paragraphs 115 and 120 of the judgment under appeal on the case-law cited in those paragraphs, since that case-law concerns the assumption that, first, the illegality vitiating the 2002 decision occurred only upon the adoption of that decision and, second, the charges on which that decision and the decision adopted later were based were the same, the two decisions being identical in every way. Yet, in the present case, it is not a matter of a simple procedural defect committed by the Commission. On the contrary, the errors committed by the institution were reflected in the overall approach taken by it and were not confined to the identification of the act's legal basis. They affected the substance of the infringement, including the definition of the relevant geographical market, the application of the principle lex mitior as well as the calculation of the amount of the fine. In addition, the General Court recognised that the 2002 decision and the decision at issue were not identical in their reasoning, in the legal classification of certain conduct or their enacting terms.</p>

            <p>In this respect, Riva claims that the statement made in paragraph 122 of the judgment under appeal -- that Riva's comparisons of the two decisions were irrelevant since the annulment of the 2002 decision caused it to be removed from the legal order of the European Union -- was mistaken and contradictory. In paragraph 120 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court relied on a comparison between the contents of the two decisions and referred to the Commission's decision following the annulment of the 2002 decision to adopt an identical decision relating to the same objections on which the undertakings had already submitted observations.</p>

            <p>According to the Commission, the claim regarding the failure to send a new statement of objections and to hold a hearing in the presence of representatives of the Member States after expiry of the ECSC Treaty is unfounded since the Commission had sent Riva the supplementary statement of objections, adopted under the procedural rules of the EC Treaty, to which Riva replied both in writing and during the hearing of 30 September 2002 in the presence of the Member States.</p>

            <p>It must be noted that, in the context of the procedure leading to the adoption of the 2002 decision, the Commission did, on 26 March 2002, address the statement of objections to the undertakings concerned, including Riva, in accordance with Article 36 CS. The oral hearing relating to that statement of objections took place on 13 June 2002. It is common ground that the representatives of the Member States were not invited to participate in that hearing, since such participation was not provided for by the rules of the ECSC Treaty, which was in force at the time.</p>

A hearing took place on 30 September 2002 in the presence of representatives of the Member States, in application of Article 11(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 2842/98 of 22 December 1998 on the hearing of parties in certain proceedings under Articles [81] and [82] of the EC Treaty ( OJ 1998 L 354, p. 18).</p>

As the Commission notes in its response, paragraph 120 concerns the complaints on which the 2002 decision and the decision at issue are based, whilst paragraph 122 concerns the comparison of those decisions made by Riva, which the General Court classed as irrelevant since it is the statement of objections and access to the file that allows the undertakings under investigation to acquaint themselves with the evidence the Commission has at its disposal and that render the rights of the defence fully effective. Contrary to Riva's claim, any difference between the texts of the two decisions, which in any case Riva has not demonstrated, does not necessarily imply, in itself, that the allegations against the undertakings concerned changed.</p>

Although the Commission based that decision on an incorrect legal basis, namely Article 65(4) and (5) CS, nevertheless, as the General Court held in paragraphs 18 and 119 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission informed Riva of the consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty in the supplementary statement of objections, based on Article 19(1) of Regulation No 17, and Riva had the opportunity to express its views on the matter.</p>

Therefore, given that, as is clear from paragraph 35 of the present judgment, the statement of objections and the supplementary statement of objections were not affected by the annulment of the 2002 decision, it is necessary to assess whether the Commission gave the parties the opportunity to develop their arguments at an oral hearing conducted in accordance with the procedural requirements of Regulations No 1/2003 and 773/2004, as it was required to do.</p>

This is clear, first, from that statement, which expressly invited its addressees to make their point of view on those supplementary objections known. Second, the Commission stated, in paragraph 382 of the decision at issue, that it did not consider it necessary to repeat the oral hearing of 13 June 2002, in application of the provisions of Regulations No 17 and 1/2003, since that hearing, in which the Member State representatives did not participate, had been conducted in conformity with the rules of the ECSC Treaty, which was applicable at the time. Furthermore, at the joint hearing in Cases C‑85/15 P to C‑89/15 P, the Commission confirmed, in its reply to a question from the Court, that the supplementary statement of objections re-examined neither the facts nor the evidence forming the subject matter of the proceedings.</p>

Indeed, the grounds of appeal raised by Riva did not present any particularly high degree of difficulty and would not have prevented the Judge-Rapporteur from carrying out his work in a shorter period of time.

Accordingly, a claim for compensation for the damage caused by the failure on the part of the General Court to adjudicate within a reasonable time may not be made directly to the Court of Justice in the context of an appeal, but must be brought before the General Court itself. The General Court, which has jurisdiction under Article 256(1) TFEU, hearing a claim for damages, is required to rule on such a claim sitting in a different composition from that which heard the dispute which gave rise to the procedure whose duration is criticised (judgment of 9 June 2016, Repsol Lubricantes y Especialidades and Others v Commission, C‑617/13 P, EU:C:2016:416, paragraphs 98 and 99 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Article 138(1) of those rules, which is applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) of the same rules, provides that the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party's pleadings. Since Riva has been successful on appeal, and the action before the General Court was upheld, the Commission must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by Riva both at first instance and on appeal, in accordance with the form of order sought by Riva. On those grounds, the Court (Ninth Chamber) hereby 1. Sets aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 9 December 2014, Riva Fire v Commission (T‑83/10, not published,EU:T:2014:1034); 2. Annuls Commission Decision C(2009) 7492 final of 30 September 2009 relating to a proceeding under Article 65 CS (Case COMP/37.956 -- Reinforcing bars, re-adoption), as amended by Commission Decision C(2009) 9912 final of 8 December 2009, in so far as it concerns Riva Fire SpA; 3. Orders the European Commission to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by Riva Fire SpA both at first instance and in the present appeal.</p>
