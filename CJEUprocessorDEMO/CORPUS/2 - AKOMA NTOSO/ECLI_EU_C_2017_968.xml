            <p>Four groups of Chinese exporting producers reported exports to the European Union during the period covered by the investigation, namely from 1 January to 31 December 2011. The group to which Giant belonged ( `the Giant group'), a company established in China which manufactures bicycles for domestic and export sales, including to the European Union, was one of those four groups of exporting producers. The ultimate shareholder of the Giant group is G.M., a company established in Taiwan. Since the joint venture Shanghai Giant &amp; Phoenix Bicycle Co. Ltd ( `GP'), one of the companies forming part of the Giant group, had ceased all operations in September 2011 and was in liquidation, Giant asked the Commission to exclude it from the investigation.</p>

In the letter sent to it, Giant was informed that, if it wished to claim MET, each of the related companies situated in China would have to complete a MET claim form, including GP, since that company produced bicycles and was the Giant group's biggest exporter to the European Union during the investigation period.</p>

            <p>By letter of 14 June 2012, the Commission sought clarification concerning the relationship between the Giant group and Jinshan. On the basis of a preliminary assessment, the Commission concluded that that group was related to Jinshan and that the principal investments of the latter related to the manufacture and sale of bicycles. Consequently, the applicant was informed that it had to return the MET claim form for Jinshan and all the companies belonging to that company ( `the Jinshan group'). The Commission indicated that, without those forms, it could draw conclusions on the basis of the facts available, in accordance with Article 18 of the basic regulation, and reject the MET claim for the Giant group as a whole.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be noted that, according to the Court's settled case-law, it follows from Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union that the General Court has exclusive jurisdiction, first, to establish the facts, except where the substantive inaccuracy of its findings is apparent from the documents submitted to it, and, secondly, to assess those facts. When the General Court has established or assessed the facts, the Court of Justice has jurisdiction under Article 256 TFEU to review the legal characterisation of those facts by the General Court and the legal conclusions it has drawn from them. The Court of Justice thus has no jurisdiction to establish the facts or, in principle, to examine the evidence which the General Court accepted in support of those facts. Save where the clear sense of the evidence has been distorted, that appraisal does not therefore constitute a point of law which is subject as such to review by the Court of Justice (judgment of 10 July 2008, Bertelsmann and Sony Corporation of America v Impala, C‑413/06 P, EU:C:2008:392, paragraph 29, and orders of 29 November 2012, Dimos Peramatos v Commission, C‑647/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:764, paragraph 28, and of 9 February 2017, Syndial v Commission, C‑410/16 P, not published, EU:C:2017:112, paragraph 9).</p>

EBMA maintains that the General Court's reasoning is based on an incorrect premiss, namely that the purpose of the information and data provided by Giant was simply to enable the EU institutions to establish the export price. Initially, the information required was the bare minimum necessary to enable those institutions to obtain a complete and accurate picture of the Giant group and of the related companies. The data provided by Giant was insufficient for the purpose of creating such a picture. Second, EBMA submits that the General Court erred in imposing an excessive burden on the Commission by asking it to demonstrate how the information it sought in connection with the related companies was necessary. Third, EBMA maintains that, in view of the broad discretion enjoyed by the Council and the Commission in anti-dumping proceedings, the General Court cannot take the place of the Council by finding that conclusions have been drawn from partial evidence.</p>

            <p>The basic regulation does not define the term `necessary information'. It follows that, in order to determine the scope of Article 18(1) of that regulation, it is necessary to take account of the wording, context and objectives of that provision (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 April 2017, Changshu City Standard Parts Factory and Ningbo Jinding Fastener v Council, C‑376/15 P and C‑377/15 P, EU:C:2017:269, paragraph 52 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the first place, with regard to the wording of Article 18(1) of the basic regulation, the adjective `necessary', in its usual meaning, refers to what is required or essential in order to achieve a particular purpose. Accordingly, only information without which the anti-dumping investigation cannot be properly concluded may be regarded as `necessary' within the meaning of that provision.</p>

            <p>It follows that information is regarded as `necessary' if, in a particular investigation, it enables such findings to be made. Given that an item of information may make it possible to reach such findings in one investigation but serve no purpose in another investigation, it must be concluded that the assessment as to whether a particular item of information is `necessary' within the meaning of Article 18(1) of the basic regulation must be carried out in the light of all the specific circumstances of each individual investigation, not in the abstract.</p>

            <p>In the second place, as regards the context of Article 18(1) of the basic regulation, it should be noted that Article 5(10) of the regulation provides that the notice of initiation of the anti-dumping proceedings, which must be published by the Commission, is to state the periods within which interested parties may make themselves known, present their views in writing and submit information, if such views and information are to be taken into account during the anti-dumping investigation. Furthermore, Article 5(11) of that regulation provides that the Commission is to advise, inter alia, the exporters, importers and representative associations of importers or exporters known to it to be concerned, of the initiation of the investigation. Moreover, it is apparent from Article 6(2) of the regulation that a questionnaire is prepared by the Commission's staff for the purpose of obtaining the information necessary for the investigation. That questionnaire is sent to the interested parties, which, as a rule, have 30 days within which to reply.</p>

        <paragraph eId="para_5215">
          <num>51</num>
          <content eId="para_5215__content">
            <p>It therefore follows from Article 5(10) and (11) and Article 6(2) of the basic regulation that the interested parties are required to provide the Commission's staff with the information that will enable it to complete the anti-dumping investigation. Therefore, in the light of those provisions, the term `necessary information' in Article 18(1) of the basic regulation refers to such information.</p>

        <paragraph eId="para_5216">
          <num>52</num>
          <content eId="para_5216__content">
            <p>Moreover, it follows from Article 18(3) and (6) of the basic regulation that the information which the interested parties are required to provide to the Commission must be used by the EU institutions for the purpose of establishing the findings of the anti-dumping investigation and that those parties must not omit relevant information. As a particular item of information may play a decisive role in one investigation and be irrelevant in another, it follows from Article 18(3) and (6) of the regulation that whether an item of information is `necessary' must be ascertained on a case-by-case basis.</p>

            <p>Therefore, the analysis of the context of Article 18(1) of the basic regulation supports the interpretation of the term `necessary information' arrived at the conclusion of the literal analysis of that provision. Accordingly, information is to be regarded as `necessary' within the meaning of that provision if it is such as to enable the EU institutions to establish appropriate findings in an anti-dumping investigation. The assessment as to whether an item of information is `necessary' must be carried out on a case-by-case basis.</p>

            <p>In the third place, the definition of the term `necessary information' must take account of the objective of Article 18 of the basic regulation. As the Advocate General observed in point 50 of his Opinion, it is for the Commission, as the investigating authority, to establish that the product concerned has been dumped, that there has been injury and that there is a causal link between the dumped imports and the injury. However, no provision in the basic regulation confers on the Commission any power to compel the interested parties to participate in the investigation or to provide information. The Commission is therefore reliant on the voluntary cooperation of those parties in supplying the necessary information (see, by analogy, judgment of 4 September 2014, Simon, Evers &amp; Co., C‑21/13, EU:C:2014:2154, paragraphs 31 and 32).</p>

          <num>55</num>
          <content eId="para_5219__content">
            <p>In that context, it follows from recital 28 of the basic regulation that the EU legislature intended to provide that, where parties do not cooperate satisfactorily, other information may be used to establish findings, and that such information may be less favourable to the parties than it would be if they had cooperated. Thus, the objective of Article 18 of the basic regulation is to enable the Commission to continue with the investigation even though the interested parties refuse to cooperate or do not cooperate satisfactorily.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, as the Advocate General observed in points 53 and 54 of his Opinion, given that the interested parties are required to cooperate to the best of their ability, they must provide all the information that they have which the EU institutions consider necessary for the purpose of reaching their findings.</p>

            <p>In that regard, as the Advocate General observed in point 67 of his Opinion, the Council stated in recital 131 of the regulation at issue that Article 18(1) of the basic regulation was applied for the purpose of determining the export price. Moreover, it is apparent from, inter alia, paragraph 52 of the judgment under appeal that the General Court addressed Giant's argument that, contrary to what the Council claimed in the regulation at issue, the information requested by the Commission concerning the Jinshan group companies was not necessary for the purpose of calculating a reliable export price and, therefore, determining an individual dumping margin. Lastly, in paragraph 23 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court referred to a letter from the Commission to Giant of 21 March 2013 in which that institution informed Giant that it intended to apply that provision for the purpose of determining the export price.</p>

            <p>In the present case, the General Court verified, in paragraphs 63 to 69 of the judgment under appeal, whether the information relating to the Jinshan group companies which the EU institutions wished to obtain in order, inter alia, to determine Giant's export price, was likely to influence that determination. That court concluded, in paragraph 74 of the judgment under appeal, that that information was irrelevant to the calculation of the export price.</p>

Indeed, it follows from, inter alia, paragraphs 54 to 57 above that the burden lies with those institutions to prove that the product concerned has been dumped, that there has been injury and that there is a causal link between the dumped imports and the injury and also, therefore, that certain information is `necessary' for the purpose of reaching the appropriate conclusions in the anti-dumping investigation.</p>

The judicial review of such discretion must therefore be limited to verifying whether the procedural rules have been complied with, whether the facts on which the contested choice is based have been accurately stated, and whether there has been a manifest error in the appraisal of those facts or a misuse of powers (judgment of 16 February 2012, Council and Commission v Interpipe Niko Tube and Interpipe NTRP, C‑191/09 P and C‑200/09 P, EU:C:2012:78, paragraph 63 and the case-law cited).</p>

That review does not encroach on the broad discretion of the institutions in the field of commercial policy, but is restricted to showing whether that evidence was able to support the conclusions reached by the institutions. The General Court must therefore not only establish whether the evidence put forward is factually accurate, reliable and consistent but also ascertain whether that evidence contained all the relevant information which had to be taken into account in order to assess a complex situation and whether it was capable of substantiating the conclusions reached (judgment of 26 January 2016, Maxcom v City Cycle Industries, C‑248/15 P, C‑254/15 P and C‑260/15 P, EU:C:2017:62, paragraph 89 and the case-law cited).</p>

It considered that, in the particular circumstances of the present case, that institution was not entitled to rely on the facts available to determine Giant's export price because, first, it was apparent from the information provided by Giant that there was no need for information concerning the Jinshan group companies for the purpose of calculating that export price and, second, that institution had been unable to specify what additional information concerning those companies might be necessary for the calculation of that price.</p>

            <p>EBMA considers, first, that the General Court erred in relying on the premiss that the case primarily concerns the determination of the export price. It was on the basis of that incorrect premiss that the General Court stated, in paragraphs 81 and 82 of the judgment under appeal, that the EU institutions cannot rely on the risk of circumvention where they have not applied Article 9(5) of the basic regulation or referred to any other provision of that regulation which provides that the existence of a risk of circumvention may justify a refusal to grant an individual anti-dumping duty to an exporting producer.</p>

          <content eId="para_5238__content">
            <p>Secondly, according to EBMA, where companies are related, such as the Giant and Jinshan groups, there is always a risk of circumvention if one related entity is granted a lower anti-dumping duty than another entity belonging to the same group. That is why the established practice of the European Union is to impose anti-dumping duty at group level, not at entity level. Therefore, paragraph 83 of the judgment under appeal, which refers to the theoretical risk of circumvention between unrelated entities, is fundamentally flawed and incorrect as a matter of law, as circumvention is more likely to occur and more difficult to detect between related companies. Furthermore, according to EBMA, paragraph 84 of the judgment under appeal misses the point. The Panel Report and the Appellate Body Report of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body cited in that paragraph concern whether Article 9(5) of the basic regulation is consistent with Article 9.2 of the Agreement on the implementation of Article VI of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 ( OJ 1994 L 336, p. 103).</p>

            <p>In the first place, EBMA calls into question paragraphs 81 and 82 of the judgment under appeal. In paragraph 81 of that judgment, the General Court summarised the content of Article 9(5) of the basic regulation. It stated, in paragraph 82 of the judgment, that the existence of a risk of circumvention could not be invoked by the Council to justify the refusal to grant an individual anti-dumping duty because, first, that provision had not been taken into consideration when Giant's situation was examined and, second, no reference had been made to any other provision in the basic regulation that provides that a risk of circumvention may be taken into account.</p>

            <p>EBMA maintains that those paragraphs of the judgment under appeal are based on the incorrect premiss that the case primarily concerns the determination of the export price. However, as is apparent from paragraphs 60 and 61 above, the Council did in fact apply Article 18(1) of the basic regulation to the determination of the export price, which was challenged by Giant both in the anti-dumping investigation and before the General Court.</p>

            <p>In the second place, EBMA calls into question paragraphs 83 and 84 of the judgment under appeal. In those paragraphs, the General Court stated that the Council was not entitled to rely on a purely hypothetical risk of circumvention. It also referred, in that regard, to certain Panel Reports and Appellate Body Reports of the WTO Dispute Settlement Body.</p>

            <p>That argument cannot be accepted. Even though the risk of circumvention of anti-dumping measures is higher in the case of related exporters on which different anti-dumping duties might be imposed, the EU institutions are nonetheless required to demonstrate that, in the light of the particular circumstances of the investigation concerned, there is a genuine risk of circumvention.</p>
