Legislative authority is vested in the Queen and in the Parliament of Gibraltar, whose members are elected every four years by the Gibraltar electorate. Gibraltar has its own courts.

            <p>On 17 July 2014, a tax regime concerning certain gambling duties imposed by the FA 2014 and supplemented by communications and guidelines adopted by the revenue and customs authorities ( `the new tax regime') entered into force in the United Kingdom.</p>

          <content eId="para_9361__content">
            <p>The GBGA brought an application before the referring court for judicial review of the new tax regime in the light of EU law. It argues in that context that the taxes payable under the regime are extraterritorial taxes, that they constitute an obstacle to freedom to provide services and that they discriminate against service providers established outside the United Kingdom. Moreover, it contends that such taxes cannot be justified by the objectives claimed by the United Kingdom, which are essentially of an economic nature. As a consequence, the new tax regime is incompatible with Article 56 TFEU.</p>

            <p>The referring court states in that connection that, under the regime for the taxation of remote gaming applicable before the entry into force of the new tax regime, providers of remote gambling services established in the United Kingdom paid tax at the rate of 15% on their gross profits, irrespective of where their customers lived, the tax being based on the `place of supply' principle. Providers of remote gambling services established in Gibraltar or elsewhere outside the United Kingdom paid no tax in the United Kingdom on gambling services provided to persons established in the United Kingdom.</p>

            <p>The national court observes that one of the main objectives of the new tax regime, which is based on the `place of consumption' principle, is to change the taxation of gambling so that, wherever they are based, providers offering such services to customers in the United Kingdom pay tax on such services to the United Kingdom Exchequer, the rate of that tax being set at 15% of the provider's profits, as defined by the FA 2014, during the relevant tax period.</p>

            <p>As a result of those new taxes, in particular the remote gaming duty to which the national court refers in its decision and which is applicable without distinction to all economic operators providing remote gambling services to persons established in the United Kingdom, providers of such services established in Gibraltar, such as the members of the GBGA, may no longer, according to the referring court, provide their services on the United Kingdom gambling market without paying any tax in that Member State.</p>

            <p>In the light of those considerations, the referring court considers that it is necessary to clarify the constitutional status of Gibraltar under EU law and, in particular, whether economic operators, such as the members of the GBGA, established in Gibraltar may rely on EU law to challenge the legislation adopted by the United Kingdom establishing the new tax regime and, if so, whether such legislation is at odds with the requirements of Article 56 TFEU.</p>

                </tblock>
                <p>26 By its first question, the referring court seeks to ascertain, in essence, whether Article 355(3) TFEU, in conjunction with Article 56 TFEU, is to be interpreted as meaning that the provision of services by operators established in Gibraltar to persons established in the United Kingdom constitutes, under EU law, a situation confined in all respects within a single Member State.</p>

            <p>For the purpose of answering that question, it is appropriate to observe at the outset that EU law is applicable to the Member States pursuant to Article 52(1) TEU. According to Article 52(2) TEU, the territorial scope of the Treaties is specified in Article 355 TFEU.</p>

            <p>By way of derogation from Article 355(3) TFEU, under the 1972 Act of Accession, EU acts do not apply to Gibraltar in certain areas of EU law. Those exceptions were introduced on account of the special legal position of that territory, in particular its status as a free port (see, in that regard, judgment of 21 July 2005, Commission v United Kingdom, C‑349/03, EU:C:2005:488, paragraph 41). However, freedom to provide services, enshrined in Article 56 TFEU, is not one of those exceptions.</p>

            <p>That fact is not, however, decisive in determining whether two territories must, for the purposes of the applicability of the provisions on the four freedoms, be treated as a single Member State. Indeed, the Court has previously held, in paragraph 54 of the judgment of 8 November 2005, Jersey Produce Marketing Organisation ( C‑293/02, EU:C:2005:664), that, for the purposes of the application of Articles 23, 25, 28 and 29 EC, the Channel Islands, of which the Bailiwick of Jersey forms part, the Isle of Man and the United Kingdom must be treated as a single Member State, notwithstanding the fact that those islands do not form part of the United Kingdom.</p>

            <p>In reaching that conclusion, the Court, after observing that the United Kingdom is responsible for the Bailiwick of Jersey's external relations, relied in particular on the fact that, according to Article 1(1) of Protocol No 3 on the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man annexed to the 1972 Act of Accession, EU rules on customs matters and quantitative restrictions are to apply to the Channel Islands and to the Isle of Man `under the same conditions as they apply to the United Kingdom', and on the fact that no aspect of the status of those islands suggests that relations between the islands and the United Kingdom are akin to those between Member States (see, in that regard, judgment of 8 November 2005, Jersey Produce Marketing Organisation, C‑293/02, EU:C:2005:664, paragraphs 43, 45 and 46).</p>

            <p>As regards, in the first place, the conditions under which Article 56 TFEU is to apply to Gibraltar, it is true that Article 355(3) TFEU does not state that Article 56 is to apply to Gibraltar `under the same conditions as they apply to the United Kingdom'.</p>

            <p>That said, it should be recalled that Article 355(3) TFEU extends the applicability of the provisions of EU law to the territory of Gibraltar, subject to the exclusions expressly provided for in the 1972 Act of Accession, which do not, however, cover freedom to provide services.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the fact, relied on by the Government of Gibraltar, that Article 56 TFEU is applicable to Gibraltar, by virtue of Article 355(3) TFEU, and to the United Kingdom, by virtue of Article 52(1) TEU, is irrelevant in that regard. In an analogous context, the fact that EU rules on customs matters and quantitative restrictions apply to the Channel Islands and to the Isle of Man, pursuant to Article 1(1) of Protocol No 3 annexed to the 1972 Act of Accession, and to the United Kingdom, pursuant to Article 52(1) TEU, has not prevented the Court from concluding that, for the purposes of the application of those rules, those islands and the United Kingdom are to be treated as a single Member State (judgment of 8 November 2005, Jersey Produce Marketing Organisation, C‑293/02, EU:C:2005:664, paragraph 54).</p>

            <p>To treat trade between Gibraltar and the United Kingdom in the same way as trade between Member States would be tantamount to denying the connection, recognised in Article 355(3) TFEU, between that territory and that Member State. It is common ground in that regard that it is the United Kingdom that has assumed obligations towards the other Member States under the Treaties so far the application and transposition of EU law in the territory of Gibraltar is concerned (see, in that regard, judgments of 23 September 2003, Commission v United Kingdom, C‑30/01, EU:C:2003:489, paragraphs 1 and 47, and 21 July 2005, Commission v United Kingdom, C‑349/03, EU:C:2005:488, paragraph 56), as the Advocate General observed in point 37 of his Opinion.</p>

            <p>That interpretation is not called into question by the Government of Gibraltar's argument that such a conclusion would undermine the objective laid down in Article 26 TFEU of ensuring the functioning of the internal market, as well as the objective of integrating Gibraltar into that market, which, according to that Government, Article 355(3) TFEU seeks to attain.</p>

            <p>With regard, in the first place, to the status of Gibraltar under constitutional law, the Government of Gibraltar submits, in reliance on the judgment of 10 October 1978, Hansen &amp; Balle ( 148/77, EU:C:1978:173), that the status of that territory under EU law should be defined by reference, in particular, to its status under domestic law.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be noted that the Court's finding in paragraph 10 of that judgment that the status of the French overseas departments is primarily defined by reference to the French constitution, under which those departments are an integral part of the French Republic, has to be read in its proper context, as it relates to the interpretation of Article 227(1) of the EEC Treaty, which provided that that Treaty was to apply to the whole of the `French Republic' (see, in that regard, judgment of 10 October 1978, Hansen &amp; Balle ( 148/77, EU:C:1978:173, paragraph 9). Thus, by that clarification, the Court simply intended to recognise that those departments form part of that Member State and that EU law was to apply automatically to those territories, after the expiry of the two-year period referred to in Article 227(2) of that Treaty, as they formed an integral part of that Member State (see, in that regard, judgment of 10 October 1978, Hansen &amp; Balle ( 148/77, EU:C:1978:173, paragraph 10).</p>
