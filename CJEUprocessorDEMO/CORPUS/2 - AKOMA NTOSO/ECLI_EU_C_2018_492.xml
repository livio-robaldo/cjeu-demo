The referring court points out, however, that, at the time of the facts giving rise to the dispute in the main proceedings, the national legislation made such recognition, as well as the issuing of the certificate referred to in paragraph 17 above, conditional on the annulment of any marriage entered into before such a change took place. According to the referring court, such annulment was also required in order for a person who had changed gender, such as MB, to access the State retirement pension as from the statutory pensionable age of persons of the gender acquired by that person.</p>

            <p>Before the referring court, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions submitted that, according to the Court's case-law resulting from the judgments of 7 January 2004, K. B. ( C‑117/01, EU:C:2004:7, paragraph 35) and of 27 April 2006, Richards ( C‑423/04, EU:C:2006:256, paragraph 21), it is for the Member States to determine the conditions under which a person's change of gender may be legally recognised.

            <p>In that context, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions noted that the European Court of Human Rights has recognised that Member States may make recognition of a change of gender conditional on the annulment of that person's marriage (ECtHR, 16 July 2014, Hämäläinen v. Finland, CE:ECHR:2014:0716JUD003735909). He submitted that, although the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed at Rome on 4 November 1950, requires States that are party to it to recognise the acquired gender of transsexual persons, it does not require them to allow marriages between same-sex couples. Indeed, the objective of maintaining the traditional concept of marriage as being a union between a man and a woman could, it was argued, justify making recognition of a change of gender subject to such a condition.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling: `Does Council Directive 79/7/EEC preclude the imposition in national law of a requirement that, in addition to satisfying the physical, social and psychological criteria for recognising a change of gender, a person who has changed gender must also be unmarried in order to qualify for a State retirement pension?'</p>

            <p>By its question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Directive 79/7, in particular the first indent of Article 4(1), read in conjunction with the third indent of Article 3(1)(a) and Article 7(1)(a) thereof, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation that requires a person who has changed gender not only to fulfil physical, social and psychological criteria but also to satisfy the condition of not being married to a person of the gender that he or she has acquired as a result of that change, in order to be able to claim a State retirement pension as from the statutory pensionable age applicable to persons of that acquired gender.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, it must be noted that the case in the main proceedings and the question referred to the Court concern only the conditions for entitlement to the State retirement pension at issue in the main proceedings. Accordingly, the Court is not being asked to consider, generally, whether the legal recognition of a change of gender may be conditional on the annulment of a marriage entered into before that change of gender.</p>

            <p>The United Kingdom Government claims that marriage and the legal recognition of change of gender are matters which fall within the competence of the Member States with regard to civil status. In its view, in exercising that competence, Member States not permitting marriage between persons of the same sex may, therefore, make the payment of a State retirement pension dependent on the annulment of an earlier marriage between such persons.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be noted that, although EU law does not detract from the competence of the Member States in matters of civil status and legal recognition of the change of a person's gender, Member States must, when exercising that competence, comply with EU law and, in particular, with the provisions relating to the principle of non-discrimination (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgments of 27 April 2006, Richards, C‑423/04, EU:C:2006:256, paragraphs 21 to 24; of 1 April 2008, Maruko, C‑267/06, EU:C:2008:179, paragraph 59; and of 5 June 2018, Coman and Others, C‑673/16, EU:C:2018:385, paragraphs 37 and 38 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Thus, it is clear, inter alia, from the Court's case-law that national legislation making eligibility for a pension benefit subject to a condition relating to civil status cannot be placed outside the scope of the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of sex set out in Article 157 TFEU in the area of workers' remuneration (see, to that effect, concerning Article 141 EC, judgment of 7 January 2004, K.

In that regard, although, as it was noted in paragraph 29 of the present judgment, it is for the Member States to establish the conditions for legal recognition of a person's change of gender, the fact remains that, for the purposes of the application of Directive 79/7, persons who have lived for a significant period as persons of a gender other than their birth gender and who have undergone a gender reassignment operation must be considered to have changed gender.</p>

By contrast, according to the information in the file before the Court, that marriage annulment condition does not apply to persons who have retained their birth gender and are married, who accordingly may receive a State retirement pension as from the statutory pensionable age for persons of that gender irrespective of their marital status.</p>

            <p>The United Kingdom Government takes the view that those situations are not comparable on the ground that the marital statuses of the persons in question are different. A person who has changed gender after marrying finds himself or herself married to a person of the gender that he or she has acquired, in contrast to a person who has retained his or her birth gender and is married to a person of the opposite sex. According to the United Kingdom Government, having regard to the purpose of the marriage annulment condition at issue in the main proceedings -- which is to avoid the existence of marriages between persons of the same sex -- such a difference means that the situations of those persons are not comparable.</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is clear from the information provided in the order for reference that the subject matter of the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings is the granting of a `Category A' State retirement pension which can be claimed by persons who have reached the statutory pensionable age. The parties to the main proceedings clarified, during the hearing before the Court, that national law grants such a retirement pension to all persons who have reached that age and who have made adequate contributions to the United Kingdom's State pension scheme. Accordingly, it appears that the State statutory retirement pension scheme at issue in the main proceedings protects against the risks of old age by conferring on the person concerned the right to a retirement pension acquired in relation to the contributions paid by that person during his or her working life, irrespective of marital status.</p>

            <p>Thus, in the light of the subject matter of the retirement pension and the conditions under which it is granted, as set out in the previous paragraph, the situation of a person who changed gender after marrying and that of a person who has kept his or her birth gender and is married are comparable.</p>

            <p>As the Advocate General observed in point 43 of his Opinion, the United Kingdom Government's argument, which emphasises the difference in the marital status of those persons, has the effect of making that difference the decisive element in determining the comparability of the situations at issue, whereas marital status, in itself, is not relevant for the purposes of the granting of the State retirement pension at issue in the main proceedings, as has been noted in paragraph 43 above.</p>

            <p>Moreover, the purpose of the marriage annulment condition invoked by that Government -- namely, to avoid marriage between persons of the same sex -- is unrelated to that retirement pension scheme. As a result, that purpose does not affect the comparability of the situation of a person who changed gender after marrying and that of a person who kept his or her birth gender and is married, in the light of the subject matter and the conditions under which that retirement pension is granted, as set out in paragraph 43 of this judgment.</p>

            <p>That interpretation is not invalidated by the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, to which the United Kingdom Government also refers in order to contest the comparability of the situation of those persons. As the Advocate General stated in point 44 of his Opinion, the European Court of Human Rights, in its judgment of 16 July 2014, Hämäläinen v. Finland(CE:ECHR:2014:0716JUD003735909, §111 and §112), assessed whether or not the situation of a person who had undergone gender reassignment surgery after marrying was comparable to the situation of a married person who had not changed gender, in the light of the subject matter of the national legislation at issue, which concerned the legal recognition of a change of gender with regard to civil status. By contrast, as has been noted in paragraph 27 of the present judgment, what is at issue in the present case is the comparability of the situations of the persons concerned in the light of legislation the subject matter of which is specifically entitlement to a State retirement pension.</p>

            <p>Therefore, it must be held that the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings accords less favourable treatment, directly based on sex, to a person who changed gender after marrying, than that accorded to a person who has kept his or her birth gender and is married, even though those persons are in comparable situations.</p>
