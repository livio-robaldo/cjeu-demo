On the basis of the criteria set out in Annex III (Stage 1) and relevant scientific information, each Member State shall propose a list of sites indicating which natural habitat types in Annex I and which species in Annex II that are native to its territory the sites host. For animal species ranging over wide areas these sites shall correspond to the places within the natural range of such species which present the physical or biological factors essential to their life and reproduction. For aquatic species which range over wide areas, such sites will be proposed only where there is a clearly identifiable area representing the physical and biological factors essential to their life and reproduction. Where appropriate, Member States shall propose adaptation of the list in the light of the results of the surveillance referred to in Article 11. The list shall be transmitted to the Commission, within three years of the notification of this Directive, together with information on each site. That information shall include a map of the site, its name, location, extent and the data resulting from application of the criteria specified in Annex III (Stage 1) provided in a format established by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 21. 2.   On the basis of the criteria set out in Annex III (Stage 2) and in the framework both of each of the nine biogeographical regions referred to in Article 1(c)(iii) and of the whole of the territory referred to in Article 2(1), the Commission shall establish, in agreement with each Member State, a draft list of [SCIs] drawn from the Member States' lists identifying those which host one or more priority natural habitat types or priority species. ... The list of sites selected as [SCIs], identifying those which host one or more priority natural habitat types or priority species, shall be adopted by the Commission in accordance with the procedure laid down in Article 21. ... 4.   Once [an SCI] has been adopted in accordance with the procedure laid down in paragraph 2, the Member State concerned shall designate that site as a special area of conservation as soon as possible and within six years at most, establishing priorities in the light of the importance of the sites for the maintenance or restoration, at a favourable conservation status, of a natural habitat type in Annex I or a species in Annex II and for the coherence of Natura 2000, and in the light of the threats of degradation or destruction to which those sites are exposed. 5.

In the light of the conclusions of the assessment of the implications for the site and subject to the provisions of paragraph 4, the competent national authorities shall agree to the plan or project only after having ascertained that it will not adversely affect the integrity of the site concerned and, if appropriate, after having obtained the opinion of the general public. 4.   If, in spite of a negative assessment of the implications for the site and in the absence of alternative solutions, a plan or project must nevertheless be carried out for imperative reasons of overriding public interest, including those of a social or economic nature, the Member State shall take all compensatory measures necessary to ensure that the overall coherence of Natura 2000 is protected.

It thus provides that the management activity in those areas, which are stated not to include the nature reserves, must be limited, in particular, to the pruning and felling of trees which constitute a danger to public safety or a fire risk, allowing natural renewal, maintaining forest resources in a state that limits to the minimum the penetration of forests by man, and creating a protective belt on the boundaries of those areas by installing pheromone traps intended to prevent the penetration from and into those areas of organisms which are sufficiently harmful to threaten the survival of the forests.</p>

            <p>The Commission contends that the second, third and fourth complaints are admissible. The events in respect of which the Republic of Poland is criticised in the reasoned opinion concern only the Białowieża Forest District for the sole reason that the measures adopted by the Polish authorities, as at the date of that opinion, concerned solely that district. However, the same measures have also been adopted by the Republic of Poland for the other two forest districts forming part of the Puszcza Białowieska Natura 2000 site. As identical events constituting the same conduct are involved, the action for failure to fulfil obligations justifiably relates to the entire territory covered by the active forest management operations concerned on the date when the case was brought before the Court. The fact that the geographical scope was extended between the reasoned opinion and the action for failure to fulfil obligations is solely a consequence of the Polish authorities' own choice to adopt decisions of the same nature in the course of the pre-litigation procedure and to make them public belatedly. 2.

            <p>According to the Commission, the 2016 appendix, in that it amends the 2012 FMP, constitutes a `plan' or a `project' not directly connected with or necessary to the management of the Puszcza Białowieska Natura 2000 site, but likely to have a significant effect thereon on account of the tripling of the volume of harvestable timber in the Białowieża Forest District for which it provides. Unlike the 2015 PZO, the 2012 FMP is not a `management plan' within the meaning of Article 6(1) of the Habitats Directive because it does not lay down the objectives and the necessary conservation measures for Natura 2000 sites. The main purpose of the 2012 FMP is to regulate forest management practices, in particular by setting the maximum volume of timber which can be extracted and by establishing forest protection measures. It was therefore necessary, before adopting or amending it, to carry out an appropriate assessment of its implications for the Natura 2000 site concerned in the light of the conservation objectives of that site, in accordance with Article 6(3) of the Habitats Directive.</p>

In the present case, the constitutive characteristics of the integrity of that site are the following: the natural ecological processes which occur there, such as natural regeneration of the trees, natural species selection uncontrolled by man and natural ecological succession; the diversity in terms of species composition and the age structure of its forest stands, which include a significant proportion of trees in the optimal or terminal phase; the abundance of dead wood; and the presence of species typical of natural forests undisturbed by man and inhabiting natural habitats.</p>

            <p>On the basis of current knowledge, outbreaks of the spruce bark beetle form part of the natural cycle of old forests that contain spruce trees. Those phenomena have been regularly observed in the past in the Białowieża Forest. Moreover, they are not monitored at all within the Białowieża National Park, where the conservation status of the habitats is better than in the forest districts managed by the State Forest Office, in which `sanitary pruning/felling' has been carried out. Scientific studies also attest to the better conservation status of Białowieża Forest habitats which are excluded from all human intervention. Also, scientists fear that the removal of dead or dying trees disrupts the age structure balance of the forest stands, impoverishes the diversity of protected species and habitats, and eliminates important food sources for many protected animal species. The removal of dead wood within the framework of `sanitary pruning/felling' is therefore incompatible with the conservation objectives of the protected areas, since retention of the dead wood in the forest is necessary to preserve biodiversity.</p>

Thus, the `forest restoration area' in which the operations intended to prevent the spread of the spruce bark beetle began pursuant to the 2016 appendix amounts to 34000 hectares, that is to say, 50% of that site, whilst the reference areas extend over 17000 hectares.</p>

It is, moreover, founded on an erroneous method, since it does not refer to the specific objectives for the conservation of the habitats and animal species which were the subject matter of the 2015 PZO, it does not define what is meant by the integrity of the Puszcza Białowieska Natura 2000 site and it does not indicate how the planned operations are not liable to have an adverse effect thereon. Nor was the 2016 appendix adopted on the basis of updated information, since, in order to have a better knowledge of the locations where those species are distributed, the Polish authorities initiated a survey of the site in 2016, the results of which were still being established when the reasoned opinion was adopted.</p>

Therefore, the Republic of Poland has infringed Article 6(3) of the Habitats Directive if only because the Minister for the Environment, when approving the 2016 appendix, could not be certain that the operations provided for in that appendix would not have adverse effects on the integrity of the Puszcza Białowieska Natura 2000 site. It also follows that no subsequent measure can remedy the infringement of that provision, even in the event that it is subsequently established that there are no adverse effects, since the conditions for the adoption of a positive decision were not fulfilled when that appendix was approved.</p>

            <p>The creation of reference areas by Decision No 52 cannot therefore be regarded as a measure mitigating the adverse effects of implementation of the 2016 appendix. First, those areas were not covered by the 2015 impact assessment. Second, the establishment of those areas does not make it possible to prevent or reduce the adverse effects caused by implementation of that appendix. It merely preserves the prior situation in part of the Białowieża Forest District, but does not limit the adverse effects resulting from the operations provided for in the 2016 appendix on the rest of that district, which covers a larger area. The reference areas were, moreover, designated arbitrarily. In actual fact, since the designation of such areas did not affect the maximum total volume of timber extraction set in the 2016 appendix, the establishment of those areas results in an intensification of felling in the rest of the Białowieża Forest District. Furthermore, it is possible to derogate from the exclusion of those areas. In addition, Decision No 51 orders the felling and removal of dry trees and trees of all age classes colonised by the spruce bark beetle without taking into account those areas.</p>

Such a plan is in fact a technical tool necessary to implement the conservation measures provided for in the 2015 PZO, since the latter does not set a volume for timber extraction.

            <p>Next, the Republic of Poland states that it was considered likely that implementation of the 2016 appendix could have a potential impact on the Puszcza Białowieska Natura 2000 site. It was for that very reason that it was considered necessary to carry out the 2015 impact assessment. In this instance, following that assessment an initial draft of the appendix, increasing the volume of timber harvesting to 317894 m 3, received a negative opinion. Taking that assessment into account, the 2016 appendix reduced timber harvesting by 129000 m 3. The fresh assessment relating to that appendix showed that there was no likelihood of a significant adverse effect on the integrity of the site. In actual fact, the appendix has a significant positive impact on the elements protected in the 2015 PZO. Indeed, the change in the harvesting volume is essential for implementing the conservation measures provided for in the 2015 PZO. Furthermore, the 2016 appendix does not provide for the deliberate killing, capture or disturbance of animals.</p>

            <p>In that regard, the Commission failed to take into account the fact that the integrity of that site has been shaped for centuries by human activities, through sustainable harvesting of the forests. In particular, the state and percentage coverage of the habitats and species present when that site was designated are the result of the previous harvesting of the Białowieża Forest, that is to say, the extraction of timber from forest stands planted in the past. In fact, it is the drastic reduction, under pressure from the Commission, of logging in ageing forest stands in the 2012 FMP which led to a die-back of forest stands, in particular of spruce trees, on account of the resulting spread of the spruce bark beetle. Following that die-back, the protected habitats began to undergo changes. In particular, habitat 9170 (sub-continental oak-hornbeam forests), that is to say, the dominant habitat, started to be converted into bogs or meadows. The Polish authorities therefore drew up the remediation programme having as its starting point an overall survey of the state of the habitats and species of the Puszcza Białowieska Natura 2000 site. In that context, the adoption of the 2016 appendix is an attempt to return to the former method of management.</p>

The Commission therefore erred in acting on the basis of the primal nature of the Białowieża Forest and asserting that the species present in that forest are species typical of areas undisturbed by man.</p>

            <p>Active forest management is also chosen in other Member States. Thus, in Austria a programme was established to limit the spread of the spruce bark beetle in national parks and on land having a high nature value, in the context of which the prohibition on carrying out works was maintained in `biodiversity centres', while neighbouring productive forests were simultaneously protected by the use of forest management techniques. It is generally recommended that land on which natural processes are protected, such as national parks, be clearly divided into an intervention-free area and peripheral areas, in which operations to limit the spread of the spruce bark beetle will be carried out. By creating reference areas, the Republic of Poland implemented an identical approach.</p>

            <p>The Republic of Poland argues that the operations provided for in the 2016 appendix are consistent with the 2015 PZO. In accordance with the 2015 PZO, the 2016 appendix precludes management operations such as felling and pruning prior to felling in stands of a species in which at least 10% of the specimens are a century old or more. In those stands, only `sanitary pruning/felling' takes place, in order to eliminate spruce wood colonised by the spruce bark beetle. Dry wood is not removed. In addition, no `sanitary pruning/felling' is carried out in nature reserves and in boggy and wet habitats. The areas which are not covered by `sanitary pruning/felling' thus represent 7123 hectares, that is to say, 58% of the surface area of the Białowieża Forest District. Furthermore, the operations provided for in the 2016 appendix concern only 5.4% of the surface area of the site at issue, that is to say, 3401 hectares. In those circumstances, the 2015 impact assessment found that the potential threat, identified in the 2015 PZO, linked to the removal of dead and dying trees could not materialise.</p>

As for flat bark beetle populations, they are concentrated on aspen and ash trees, according to studies conducted in the course of 2016 and 2017, in which nearly 12000 trees were analysed. The survey carried out since April 2016 is the first project of that nature, in which various constituent elements of biodiversity have been objectively assessed and statistically verified over 1400 areas distributed within a regular network, covering the entire Białowieża Forest site. So far as concerns Boros schneideri, the most significant threat also results from the decline of the pine tree. The most serious threat to the false darkling beetle, Pytho kolwensis and Rhysodes sulcatus results from interruption of the continuing flow of large pieces of dead wood, an interruption caused by the rapid die-back of older spruce stands on account of the spread of the spruce bark beetle.</p>

            <p>Moreover, the implementation of felling related to the removal of dead spruce trees has a positive impact on the habitat of the goldstreifiger beetle and the hermit beetle, by increasing access to light in the forest. As for the other species, namely Boros schneideri, the flat bark beetle and Rhysodes sulcatus, spruce is not their favourite species. At present, the Białowieża Forest has on average about 64 m</p>

            <p>According to the Republic of Poland, account should also be taken of the reference areas. Those areas are in no way intended to offset or mitigate the allegedly negative impact of the active forest management operations at issue. They were established in accordance with the principle of sincere cooperation, referred to in Article 4(3) TEU, for the purpose of comparison with other areas of the Białowieża Forest. Moreover, their location is linked to the conservation status of the natural habitats and the absence of any necessity to carry out conservation tasks arising from the 2015 PZO. Nor can the Commission criticise the Polish authorities for having failed to carry out an environmental impact assessment in relation to the reference areas. If such reasoning were followed, the same criticism should be made concerning the interruption of logging throughout the Białowieża Forest sought by the Commission.</p>

            <p>In that regard, the Commission is mistaken in its view that inaction has a positive impact on biodiversity. Thus, the results of the survey carried out since April 2016 show that, for example, in the strict protection area of the Białowieża National Park only one colony of Boros schneideri is present, while in the Białowieża Forest District the presence of 70 such colonies has been observed. A similar situation exists for a whole series of other species, such as, in particular, the pygmy owl and the three-toed woodpecker.</p>

            <p>Finally, so far as concerns taking account of the best scientific knowledge available, the Republic of Poland observes that the Białowieża Forest is an ecosystem which is so specific and unique that the results of the studies on interdependence between various organisms carried out in other ecosystems cannot be transposed to the situation in that forest. Whilst part of the scientific community is opposed to dealing with the spread of the spruce bark beetle by the felling of colonised trees, there is also a series of scientific works according to which the absence of a response to the spruce bark beetle in the Białowieża Forest gives rise specifically to a high probability of serious and irreparable harm for the natural habitats and habitats of the animal species for the conservation of which the Puszcza Białowieska Natura 2000 site was designated. In addition, according to a study concerning the Białowieża Forest, strict protection should be only a supplement to and not the main element of the strategy for conserving and maintaining a high level of biodiversity.(b) Findings of the Court</p>

            <p>First, as is already apparent from paragraphs 126 and 167 above, although the first symptoms of the spread of the spruce bark beetle were, according to the Republic of Poland, observed in 2011, the spruce bark beetle was not identified in the slightest by the 2015 PZO as a potential threat to the integrity of the Puszcza Białowieska Natura 2000 site; on the contrary it is the removal of spruces and pines a century or more old colonised by the spruce bark beetle that was listed by that plan as such a potential threat. Nor, contrary to what the Republic of Poland asserted at the hearing, does the 2015 PZO provide for the possibility of carrying out `sanitary pruning/felling' directed specifically at trees colonised by the spruce bark beetle.</p>

            <p>Whilst it is true that the 2012 FMP, following the Commission's intervention, reduced the volume of harvestable timber in the Białowieża Forest District for the period 2012 to 2021 to 63471 m 3, it is common ground that even before the end of 2015, that is to say, after less than four years, that ceiling, as stated in paragraph 24 above, had already been reached by the Polish authorities.</p>

            <p>Third, as is already clear from paragraphs 160 to 163 above, the active forest management operations at issue are not in any way targeted only at spruces colonised by the spruce bark beetle, since those operations, first, also relate to dead spruces even if they are not colonised by the spruce bark beetle, and second, do not exclude the removal of other types of trees, such as, hornbeam, oak, alder, ash, willow and poplar trees. As the Republic of Poland confirmed at the hearing in reply to a question from the Court in this regard, the spruce bark beetle colonises only coniferous trees, essentially spruces, but not broad-leaf trees.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, whilst it is true that, as the Republic of Poland itself stated at the hearing, a certain balance must be struck, in combating the spread of the spruce bark beetle, between active forest management measures and passive forest management measures, in order to achieve the conservation objectives envisaged by the Habitats and Birds Directives, it is clear that, as the Advocate General has observed in point 158 of his Opinion, such a balancing exercise cannot be found at all in the requirements of Decision No 51, which permit spruces to be felled and dead and dying trees to be removed without a restriction other than the ceiling resulting from the maximum volume of harvestable timber authorised in the three forest districts at issue.</p>

            <p>Fourth, it is apparent from the material supplied to the Court and the exchange of argument at the hearing that, as at the date of adoption of the 2016 appendix, there was still scientific controversy regarding the most appropriate methods to stop the spread of the spruce bark beetle. As is clear from the remediation programme, that controversy related, in particular, to the very desirability of combating its spread, which, according to certain views in the scientific community, formed part of a natural cycle corresponding to periodic trends specific to the characteristics of the site whose preservation was the objective justifying the site's designation in the list of SCIs and as an SPA. Consequently, in accordance with the case-law recalled in paragraph 117 above, the Polish authorities could not adopt the 2016 appendix, as there was no scientific certainty that the active forest management operations at issue would not have lasting adverse effects on the integrity of the site concerned.</p>

            <p>Fifth and finally, the Republic of Poland cannot, without contradicting itself, seek to base an argument on the measures taken by other Member States, such as the Republic of Austria, to combat the spread of the spruce bark beetle, since according to its own contentions, repeated at the hearing, the Białowieża Forest is so specific and unique that scientific studies relating to other ecosystems cannot be transposed to it.</p>

          <content eId="para_10097__content">
            <p>On the other hand, so far as concerns the same ecosystem, it is worth noting that the Commission observed at the hearing, without the Republic of Poland contesting the point, that in the Belarusian part of the Białowieża Forest, which is adjacent to the Puszcza Białowieska Natura 2000 site and extends over approximately 82000 hectares, the competent national authorities have not considered it necessary to carry out `sanitary pruning/felling' to stop the spread of the spruce bark beetle.</p>

          <num>182</num>
          <content eId="para_10098__content">
            <p>In the second place, so far as concerns the establishment of reference areas by Decision No 52, it should be noted that the Republic of Poland itself acknowledges that those areas are not intended to mitigate the effects of the active forest management operations at issue in the Puszcza Białowieska Natura 2000 site, since, as has already been stated in paragraph 146 above, the sole purpose of those areas was to assess the development of that site's characteristics without any human intervention.</p>

            <p>Therefore, since the reference areas provided for by Decision No 52 merely preserve the situation prior to the implementation of the 2016 appendix in certain parts of the Białowieża and Browsk Forest Districts, they do not limit at all the harmful effects stemming from the active forest management operations at issue on the remaining part of those forest districts. On the contrary, as the Commission rightly maintains, in the absence of any impact on the authorised maximum total volume of timber extraction, the establishment of those areas, which, it is common ground, relate to a surface area of 17000 hectares representing approximately half the surface area of the two forest districts at issue, is liable to aggravate those effects, as the outcome will necessarily be an intensification of felling in the parts of those forest districts that are not excluded.</p>

            <p>As to the contention that the active forest management operations at issue are also excluded in the nature reserves and in wet and boggy areas, whilst it is true that this could result in the active forest management operations at issue being precluded, as the Republic of Poland maintains, in habitats 91D0 (bog woodland) and 91E0 (alluvial forests with alder, ash, willow and poplar), it has not, however, been maintained and, a fortiori, has not been established that their preclusion would concern the entire area of those habitats. Furthermore, whilst those exclusions are referred to by the Regional Director for Environmental Protection, Białystok, in the opinion which he issued on 12 February 2016 concerning the 2016 appendix, they do not appear in that appendix or Decision No 51 or even in Decision No 52.</p>

            <p>In the third place, so far as concerns the impact of the active forest management operations at issue on saproxylic beetles, whilst the Republic of Poland contends that `dead pines that are standing and exposed to the sun', which constitute the habitat of the goldstreifiger beetle, will not be removed, it does not, however, adduce any evidence in support of that assertion, which is, moreover, contradicted by the 2016 appendix and Decision No 51 which expressly provide for the removal of dead or dying trees without including the restriction relied on by the Republic of Poland.</p>

Such a fact, even assuming it to be established, is not capable in the slightest of calling into question the fact that, for the reasons set out in paragraphs 164 to 168 above, those operations adversely affect the integrity of the Puszcza Białowieska Natura 2000 site.</p>

            <p>Finally, in the fifth place, in so far as the Republic of Poland, in justifying some of the active forest management operations at issue on grounds relating to public safety or to the need to exploit the forest's resources for economic and/or social reasons, may seek to rely on Article 6(4) of the Habitats Directive, it should be borne in mind that, whilst the main aim of that directive is admittedly to promote the maintenance of biodiversity, taking account of economic, social, cultural and regional requirements, the maintenance of such biodiversity may in certain cases require, in compliance with that provision, the maintenance, or indeed the encouragement, of human activities (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 September 2012, Nomarchiaki Aftodioikisi Aitoloakarnanias and Others, C‑43/10, EU:C:2012:560, paragraph 137).</p>

            <p>However, as a provision derogating from the criterion for authorisation laid down in the second sentence of Article 6(3) of the Habitats Directive, Article 6(4) thereof must be interpreted strictly and can be applied only after the implications of a plan or project have been analysed in accordance with Article 6(3) (see, inter alia, judgment of 21 July 2016, Orleans and Others, C‑387/15 and C‑388/15, EU:C:2016:583, paragraph 60 and the case-law cited).</p>

The assessment of any imperative reasons of overriding public interest and that of the existence of less harmful alternatives require a weighing up against the damage caused to the site by the plan or project under consideration. In addition, in order to determine the nature of any compensatory measures, the damage to the site concerned must be precisely identified (see, inter alia, judgments of 24 November 2011, Commission v Spain, C‑404/09, EU:C:2011:768, paragraph 109, and of 14 January 2016, Grüne Liga Sachsen and Others, C‑399/14, EU:C:2016:10, paragraph 57).</p>

            <p>Thus, the conservation measures provided for in the 2015 PZO for habitat 9170 (sub-continental oak-hornbeam forests) include, in particular, adapting the composition of the forest stand in a manner which is consistent with the natural habitat in forest stands dominated by aspen, birch, pine and, more rarely, spruce. Those measures are reflected in the 2012 FMP in the form of planned cleaning-up, thinning and pruning works. Timber extraction is thus required in order to carry out those conservation measures.</p>

            <p>The quantitative changes observed in a section of the populations of protected species in the Białowieża Forest are the result of increased access to food, linked to a short-term disturbance, namely the large-scale spread of the spruce bark beetle. In the longer term, the natural consequence of that situation is an abrupt decline. Permanent and geographically limited control of the spread of the spruce bark beetle, that is to say, preservation of its geographical scope and of a high proportion of spruces in stands, could be a factor that preserves a relatively stable situation in the case, for example, of woodpecker populations. Despite the possible negative effects on those populations caused by the active forest management operations at issue, the size of those populations is remaining at a relatively high level, in accordance with the 2015 PZO.</p>

            <p>There is no abrupt quantitative change in the populations of the white-backed woodpecker and the three-toed woodpecker at the boundaries of the national park. The spread of the spruce bark beetle is not on a large scale there, on account of the small proportion of spruce trees in the national park's forest stands and the different nature of the forest habitats. It follows that, in habitats having different parameters, which affect the propensity of those habitats to be subject to a large-scale spread of the spruce bark beetle, dynamic equilibrium may be maintained through selected forest management measures.</p>

            <p>All species of saproxylic beetles covered by that strict protection need, during their life cycle, dead or dying trees, whether standing or on the ground. Various scientific studies confirm that dead spruces constitute an important habitat of the flat bark beetle and are of paramount importance in its life cycle. After two or three years of decay and in later stages of their decomposition, the spruces are invaded by other species of saproxylic beetle, such as the false darkling beetle and Pytho kolwensis. Accordingly, the intensification of felling of tree stands, essentially of spruce trees, and the removal of dry or dead wood and dying trees colonised by the spruce bark beetle inevitably lead to the death of specimens of those strictly protected species and to the destruction of their breeding sites and resting places.</p>

Moreover, the false darkling beetle is a very rare species for which there are only four known habitats in Poland, so that the loss of a single habitat could have a considerable harmful impact on the maintenance of its conservation status in Europe. As for the goldstreifiger beetle, it is present in Poland only on the Puszcza Białowieska Natura 2000 site.

To ensure an appropriate state of protection, the Polish authorities have thus adopted a system of long-term conservation of habitat continuity for those species in the form of a network of forest plantation islets in reserves and of areas of protection around the protected species, on wet habitats, in the reference areas, and where dead trees are permanently and naturally present in all stands in Białowieża Forest.

As regards Boros schneideri, those results prove that it is a species which prefers pine, for which dead or dying spruce trees are not an essential habitat and which is also widespread in the whole of the Białowieża Forest. The key area for the false darkling beetle and Rhysodes sulcatus is the Białowieża National Park. The locations of the false darkling beetle in the district of Białowieża are to be found, moreover, in the reference areas. Furthermore, the essential cause of its disappearance is the absence of burned wood, Also, the presence of Pytho kolwensis is not reported outside that national park. The activity of the spruce bark beetle, on the other hand, could have a negative impact on the continuity of the environments occupied by that species, namely dead, old and felled spruce trees in wet habitats. Finally, as for the goldstreifiger beetle, the primary cause of its disappearance in Europe is the absence of old pine trees that have died following fires. Because of the lack of renewal of pine in the Białowieża National Park, the future of that species can be ensured only in harvested forests, in which pine has been artificially renewed.</p>

            <p>The Commission submits that, by implementing the active forest management operations at issue, the Republic of Poland, in breach of Article 5(b) and (d) of the Birds Directive, has failed to establish a general system of conservation preventing, in particular, the deliberate destruction of nests and the disturbance, on the Puszcza Białowieska Natura 2000 site, of the pygmy owl, the boreal owl, the white-backed woodpecker and the three-toed woodpecker, which are species listed in Annex I to that directive.</p>

            <p>Like Article 12 of the Habitats Directive, Article 5 of the Birds Directive requires the Member States not only to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework, but also to take specific and detailed conservation measures, including effective enforcement measures. That system stems from the obligation to halt the decline of the bird species referred to in Article 1 of the Birds Directive. However, it is clear that the significant increase in the volume of timber extracted in habitats of crucial importance for the breeding and resting of species naturally occurring in the wild on the site at issue increases the risk of destruction of their nests and deliberate disturbance, including during their breeding season.</p>

            <p>Indeed, the Puszcza Białowieska Natura 2000 site is the most important area in Poland for presence of the white-backed woodpecker and the three-toed woodpecker. Dying and dead trees, in particular spruce trees a century old or more, are the most important feeding and breeding places for those two species of woodpecker. The removal of thousands of trees colonised by the spruce bark beetle will result in the deliberate destruction of the habitats of those species of woodpecker and a large-scale disturbance of their populations. In that regard, the Polish authorities have not adduced any evidence showing that the two species of woodpecker at issue benefit from intensification of tree felling where their habitats are located, whereas its intensification is, on the contrary, liable to accelerate the decline in numbers of those two species. Moreover, there is no data indicating whether, after the spread of the spruce bark beetle has ended, the population of those woodpecker species will recover to a greater or lesser degree. Finally, account should be taken of the fact that spruce trees regenerate themselves in areas affected by the spruce bark beetle, without the need for human intervention.</p>

            <p>Dying and dead trees are also important nesting sites for the pygmy owl and the boreal owl, which depend on cavities hollowed out by woodpeckers. The large-scale removal of spruce trees colonised by the spruce bark beetle is a major factor in the destruction of their breeding area. The Puszcza Białowieska Natura 2000 site is one of the most important areas where those species of owl are distributed. The fact that the concentration of pygmy owls there is greater than the average concentration of that species in Poland does not justify the carrying out of active forest management operations which are liable to disturb specimens and destroy nests of that species.</p>

Furthermore, on all the Natura 2000 sites in Poland it is possible to find numbers of the two species of woodpecker at issue which are greater than those set out in the SDF. In particular, the value of the global abundance index of forest bird populations increased by 25% over the course of the 2000 to 2014 period.</p>

It is only the scale of the transformation that is impossible to foresee, that is to say, whether the decline in the stock numbers of species benefiting from the proliferation of a specific insect species will be limited to a return to the population level before the spread or whether, in view of the disappearance of food and the impossibility for the spruce bark beetle to colonise other trees, the stock of woodpeckers following that decline will be lower than that indicated, in particular, in the SDF in force and described in the conservation objectives of the site at issue.</p>

            <p>The Commission disregards the fact that the natural processes occurring on Natura 2000 sites are long-term processes. A permanent limitation of the spread of the spruce bark beetle, that is to say, a limitation of its territorial coverage and the maintenance of a high proportion of spruce trees in the stands, may be an active protection operation which maintains a relatively stable situation in relation to woodpecker populations, from a long-term perspective. Despite potential negative effects on those populations caused by the active forest management operations at issue, the size of those populations remains at a relatively high level, in accordance with the 2015 PZO, and any changes in the bird species' ranges arising from predictive models of climate change are spread over a period of time. Consequently, the final effect of the temporary operations implemented using forest management methods may make it possible to remedy the subsequent significant decline in woodpecker numbers.</p>

            <p>As regards the pygmy owl, the loss of breeding areas due to the removal of spruces on 5% of the site at issue is illusory. That species, which nests in cavities hollowed out by woodpeckers, generally the great spotted woodpecker, a species with large stock numbers, does not show any preference as to the species of tree in which it reproduces. Furthermore, the pygmy owl is often present in degraded environments. Thus, it is more frequent in the developed part of the Białowieża Forest. Similarly, the boreal owl often occupies cavities hollowed out by the black woodpecker. The removal of spruce trees on 5% of the site at issue may therefore be regarded as having no impact from the point of view of the numbers of the pygmy owl and the boreal owl inhabiting the Białowieża Forest.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, according to Finnish data, forest management through the clearing of areas, provided that the felled portion does not exceed 50% of the forest area from a long-term perspective, not only has no negative impact on those species but, by increasing accessibility of food, leads to increased reproduction. In addition, the populations of those species increase in size and spread to new areas. `Biocenotic' trees, including hollow trees, are left to their biological death. As a result, the potential nesting sites of the pygmy owl and boreal owl remain accessible, especially since the 2015 PZO provides for operations consisting in `the conservation, during management interventions, of all pines and firs with apparent cavities, except where there is a danger to the public'.(b) Findings of the Court</p>
