            <p>The Riigikohus (Supreme Court, Estonia) considers that, even though, from a formal point of view, the sales tax at issue in the main proceedings did not have the third and fourth characteristics of VAT for the purposes of the case-law of the Court, since it is not charged at each stage of the production and distribution process and it does not give rise to a deduction of the tax paid at an earlier stage, the application of that sales tax, in essence, achieved the same objective as that which would have been achieved by virtue of the third and fourth characteristics.

In that connection, particular attention must be paid to the need to safeguard the neutrality of the common system of VAT at all times (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 October 2006, Banca popolare di Cremona, C‑475/03, EU:C:2006:629, paragraph 29).</p>
