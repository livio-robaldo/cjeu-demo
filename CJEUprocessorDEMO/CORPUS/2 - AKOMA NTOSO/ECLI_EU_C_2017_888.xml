            <p>The third subparagraph of Paragraph 52e of the Laki elinkeinotulon verottamisesta (Law on taxation of business income), as so amended, ( `the EVL') states as follows: `If the transferred assets and liabilities are connected with a Finnish corporation's permanent establishment in another Member State of the European Union, the probable disposal price of the assets and the provisions deducted in the taxation of the income of the permanent establishment are to be regarded as taxable income of the transferring company. From the tax payable on that income in Finland there is deducted the tax which would have been paid in the State in which the permanent establishment is situated were it not for the provisions of the [Mergers Directive] mentioned in Paragraph 52.'</p>

            <p>According to the statement of reasons for the draft law which became the Law amending the law on taxation of business income, the third subparagraph of Paragraph 52e of the EVL, which transposes the derogation in Article 10(2) of the Mergers Directive into Finnish law, concerns situations in which, by reason of the transfer of the assets of a non-resident permanent establishment to a company that is also non-resident, those assets are no longer within Finland's tax jurisdiction. In such a situation, the market value of the transferred assets, like the provisions deducted previously in the taxation in Finland of that permanent establishment, are included in the permanent establishment's taxable income in the tax year in which the transfer takes place. The tax due in Finland on the income to be realised is reduced by the tax which would be levied on the same income in the Member State of the permanent establishment if the directive did not apply.</p>

            <p>A applied to the Verotuksen oikaisulautakunta (Tax Appeals Board, Finland) for rectification. When that application was rejected, A brought proceedings before the Helsingin hallinto-oikeus (Administrative Court, Helsinki), arguing that the legislation at issue in the main proceedings was an obstacle to freedom of establishment, since in an equivalent national situation taxation would not take place until the time of realisation of the capital gains, that is, the disposal of the assets transferred.</p>

            <p>The referring court states that, according to t he Veronsaajien oikeudenvalvontayksikkö (Tax recipients' legal services unit, Finland), the third subparagraph of Paragraph 52e of the EVL cannot be regarded as contrary to EU rules and legal principles, since the purpose of that provision is to transpose Article 10(2) of the Mergers Directive into Finnish law.</p>

            <p>The referring court observes, however, that while Article 10(2) allows the taxation of capital gains in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, it does not determine the point in time at which that taxation is to take place.</p>

            <p>The referring court is therefore uncertain whether, by providing for the taxation of the capital gains in the tax year in which the transfer of assets takes place, whereas in an equivalent national situation the taxation does not take place until the income is realised, that is, the transferred assets are disposed of, the legislation at issue in the main proceedings constitutes a restriction of freedom of establishment. If that is the case, it asks whether the legislation may be justified by an overriding reason of the public interest in connection with the distribution of powers of taxation between the Member States and, if so, whether it is proportionate to that objective.</p>

                <p>Does Article 49 TFEU preclude Finnish legislation under which, where a Finnish company, by way of a transfer of activity, transfers assets of a permanent establishment situated in another EU Member State to a company established in that State in return for new shares, the transfer of the assets is taxed immediately in the year of transfer, but in a corresponding national situation is not taxed until the time of realisation?</p>

                <p>If the answer to Questions 1 and 2 is in the affirmative, may the restriction of the right of establishment be justified on grounds such as an overriding reason of the public interest or the preservation of the national power of taxation?

            <p>By its questions, which should be considered together, the referring court essentially asks whether Article 49 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which, where a resident company, in the course of a transfer of assets, transfers a non-resident permanent establishment to a company that is also non-resident, first, provides for the immediate taxation of the capital gains resulting from the transfer and, second, does not allow deferred collection of the tax, whereas in an equivalent national situation such capital gains are not taxed until the disposal of the transferred assets.</p>

          <content eId="para_4337__content">
            <p>It should be noted, as a preliminary point, that it is common ground that the operation at issue in the main proceedings, by which A transferred a non-resident permanent establishment to a company that was also non-resident, is a transfer of assets within the meaning of Article 2(c) of the Mergers Directive. It is also not in dispute that the taxation of the capital gains of the permanent establishment resulting from that operation is covered by Article 10(2) of the Mergers Directive.</p>

          <content eId="para_4338__content">
            <p>It follows from Article 10(2) of the Mergers Directive that, where the assets transferred in a merger, division or transfer of assets include a permanent establishment of the transferring company situated in a Member State other than that of the company, the Member State of the transferring company has the right, if it applies a system of taxing worldwide profits, to tax the profits or capital gains of that permanent establishment resulting from the transfer, on condition that it gives relief for the tax that, but for the provisions of that directive, would have been charged on those profits or capital gains in the Member State in which that permanent establishment is situated, in the same way and in the same amount as it would have done if that tax had actually been charged and paid.</p>

The tax due is reduced by the tax which, were it not for the provisions of the Mergers Directive, would have been charged on those capital gains in the Member State in which the permanent establishment is situated.

            <p>As to whether the situations are comparable, it must be stated that, with reference to legislation of a Member State which seeks to tax capital gains generated within its tax jurisdiction, the situation of a company which, in the course of a transfer of assets, transfers a non-resident permanent establishment to a company that is also non-resident is, as regards the taxation of the capital gains of that permanent establishment which were generated within the tax jurisdiction of that Member State before the transfer, comparable to that of a resident company which, in the course of a transfer of assets, transfers a permanent establishment to another resident company (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 May 2015, Verder LabTec, C‑657/13, EU:C:2015:331, paragraph 38 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>As to whether the impediment can be justified by overriding reasons of the public interest recognised by EU law, it must be recalled, first, that the need to preserve the allocation of powers of taxation between Member States is a legitimate objective recognised by the Court, and that, in the absence of any unifying or harmonising measures of the European Union, the Member States retain the power to define, by treaty or unilaterally, the criteria for allocating their powers of taxation, with a view to eliminating double taxation (judgment of 21 May 2015, Verder LabTec, C‑657/13, EU:C:2015:331, paragraph 42 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Second, in accordance with the principle of fiscal territoriality, a Member State is entitled, in the case of a transfer of a non-resident permanent establishment to a non-resident company by way of a transfer of assets, to charge tax at the time of the transfer on the capital gains generated within its tax jurisdiction before the transfer. Such a measure is intended to prevent situations that might jeopardise the right of that Member State to exercise its powers of taxation in relation to activities carried on within that jurisdiction (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 May 2015, Verder LabTec, C‑657/13, EU:C:2015:331, paragraph 43 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Therefore the transfer of a non-resident permanent establishment of a resident company, by way of a transfer of assets, to a non-resident company cannot mean that the Member State concerned must waive its right to tax the capital gains generated within its tax jurisdiction before the transfer (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 May 2015, Verder LabTec, C‑657/13, EU:C:2015:331, paragraph 44).</p>

            <p>In the present case, since the transfer, in the course of a transfer of assets, of a non-resident establishment to a company that is also non-resident has the consequence of depriving Finland of any link with that establishment, and hence of its power to tax the capital gains relating to the assets of the permanent establishment after the transfer, it must be considered that national legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings is appropriate for ensuring the preservation of the allocation of powers of taxation between the Member States.</p>

            <p>As to the proportionality of the legislation at issue in the main proceedings, it follows from the Court's case-law, first, that it is in accordance with the principle of proportionality for the Member State of the transferring company, for the purpose of safeguarding the exercise of its powers of taxation, to determine the amount of tax on the capital gains generated within its tax jurisdiction at the time when its tax jurisdiction over the assets concerned ceases to exist, in the present case at the time of the transfer in question (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 May 2015, Verder LabTec, C‑657/13, EU:C:2015:331, paragraph 48 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It has been held, second, that legislation of a Member State offering a taxpayer the choice between immediate payment of tax, which creates a disadvantage for the taxpayer in terms of cash flow but frees it from subsequent administrative burdens, and deferred payment of tax, possibly together with interest in accordance with the applicable national legislation, which necessarily involves an administrative burden for the taxpayer in connection with tracing the transferred assets, constitutes a measure which, while being appropriate for ensuring the balanced allocation of powers of taxation between the Member States, is less harmful to freedom of establishment than immediate collection of the tax due (see, to that effect, judgment of 29 November 2011, National Grid Indus, C‑371/10, EU:C:2011:785, paragraph 73).</p>

            <p>As regards the administrative burden, the Court has explained that the taxpayer should be given the option to choose between, on the one hand, bearing the administrative burden relating to deferred payment of tax and, on the other, immediate collection of the tax. If the taxpayer considers that the burden is not excessive and chooses to bear it, the burden to be borne by the tax authorities cannot be regarded as excessive either (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 April 2015, Commission v Germany, C‑591/13, EU:C:2015:230, paragraph 73 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It follows that, in so far as the legislation at issue in the main proceedings does not give a resident company which, in the course of a transfer of assets, transfers a non-resident permanent establishment to a company that is also non-resident the choice between immediate payment of tax on the capital gains of that permanent establishment, on the one hand, and, deferred payment of that tax, on the other, that legislation goes beyond what is necessary to attain the objective of preserving the allocation of powers of taxation between the Member States.</p>

            <p>That assessment cannot be called in question by the fact that the legislation, pursuant to Article 10(2) of the Mergers Directive, gives relief for the tax that, but for the provisions of that directive, would have been charged on such capital gains in the Member State in which the non-resident permanent establishment is situated, given that the disproportionality of that legislation does not derive from the amount of tax due but from the fact that it makes no provision for the taxpayer to defer the time at which it is collected (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 September 2017, Trustees of the P Panayi Accumulation &amp; Maintenance Settlements, C‑646/15, EU:C:2017:682, paragraph 60).</p>

            <p>As regards the justification based on the need to ensure the effective collection of tax, raised by the German and Swedish Governments, it should be observed that, while the Court has previously accepted that it may constitute an overriding reason of the public interest capable of justifying a restriction of the freedoms of movement guaranteed by the FEU Treaty (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 June 2014, Strojírny Prostějov and ACO Industries Tábor, C‑53/13 and C‑80/13, EU:C:2014:2011, paragraph 46 and the case-law cited), the legislation at issue in the main proceedings is not appropriate for attaining it, so that that objective cannot, in a case such as that in the main proceedings, justify an impediment to freedom of establishment. As the Commission observed, for a Member State to allow a resident transferring company to opt for deferred payment of tax would not affect that Member State's possibility of requesting from that company the necessary information for collecting the tax due or of proceeding effectively to collecting it (see, by analogy, judgment of 19 June 2014, Strojírny Prostějov and ACO Industries Tábor, C‑53/13 and C‑80/13, EU:C:2014:2011, paragraphs 49 to 53).</p>

            <p>In the light of all the above considerations, the answer to the questions referred is that Article 49 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which, where a resident company, in the course of a transfer of assets, transfers a non-resident permanent establishment to a company that is also non-resident, first, provides for the immediate taxation of the capital gains resulting from the transfer and, second, does not allow deferred collection of the tax, whereas in an equivalent national situation such capital gains are not taxed until the disposal of the transferred assets, in so far as that legislation does not allow the deferred collection of the tax.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules: Article 49 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which, where a resident company, in the course of a transfer of assets, transfers a non-resident permanent establishment to a company that is also non-resident, first, provides for the immediate taxation of the capital gains resulting from the transfer and, second, does not allow deferred collection of the tax, whereas in an equivalent national situation such capital gains are not taxed until the disposal of the transferred assets, in so far as that legislation does not allow the deferred collection of the tax.</p>
