            <p>Under Article 9 of that regulation, entitled `Postponed and delayed transfers': `1.   The Member State responsible shall be informed without delay of any postponement due either to an appeal or review procedure with suspensive effect, or physical reasons such as ill health of the asylum seeker, non-availability of transport or the fact that the asylum seeker has withdrawn from the transfer procedure. 1a.   Where a transfer has been delayed at the request of the transferring Member State, the transferring and the responsible Member States must resume communication in order to allow for a new transfer to be organised as soon as possible, in accordance with Article 8, and no later than two weeks from the moment the authorities become aware of the cessation of the circumstances that caused the delay or postponement. In such a case, an updated standard form for the transfer of the data before a transfer is carried out as set out in Annex VI shall be sent prior to the transfer. 2.   A Member State which, for one of the reasons set out in Article 29(2) of [the Dublin III Regulation], cannot carry out the transfer within the normal time limit of six months from the date of acceptance of the request to take charge or take back the person concerned or of the final decision on an appeal or review where there is a suspensive effect, shall inform the Member State responsible before the end of that time limit. Otherwise, the responsibility for processing the application for international protection and the other obligations under [the Dublin III Regulation] falls to the requesting Member State, in accordance with Article 29(2) of that Regulation. ...'</p>

K., a national of the Syrian Arab Republic, and H. F., a national of the Arab Republic of Egypt, entered the territory of the European Union by means of a visa validly issued by the Republic of Croatia. It is also apparent that, after a short stay in that Member State, they crossed the Slovenian border equipped with false Greek identification. C. K. and H. F. were subsequently admitted to the reception centre for asylum seekers in Ljubljana (Slovenia) and each submitted an asylum application to the Ministry of the Interior of the Republic of Slovenia. It is again apparent from that information that C. K. was pregnant at the time of her entry into the territory of Slovenia.</p>

K., also likely to affect the well-being of her new-born child. In this regard, they argued, supported by a number of medical certificates, that C. K. had had a high-risk pregnancy and that she has suffered psychiatric difficulties since giving birth. A specialist psychiatrist, it was stated, had accordingly diagnosed her as having post-natal depression and periodic suicidal tendencies. Furthermore, it is apparent from several medical opinions that the poor state of health of C. K. is mainly caused by uncertainty regarding her status and the resulting stress. Moreover, it was stated, the deterioration in her psychological state could result in aggressive behaviour on her part towards herself and others, which might, as the case may be, require hospital care. The illness suffered by C. K., according to that psychiatrist, required that she and her child remain at the reception centre in Ljubljana to receive care there.</p>

On 29 June 2016, that court amended the judgment at first instance and confirmed that transfer decision. As regards the care that the state of health of C. K. requires, it held that it was apparent from a report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), received pursuant to a request by the Slovenian authorities, that the situation in the Republic of Croatia concerning the reception of asylum seekers was good. According to that report, that Member State had, in, inter alia, Kutina (Croatia), an accommodation centre designed specifically for vulnerable persons, where asylum seekers had free access to medical care provided by a doctor regularly visiting the centre or, in the event of emergencies, by the local hospital or even, if necessary, by the hospital in Zagreb (Croatia).</p>

However, those requirements are wider than the criterion of systemic flaws laid down by Article 3(2) of that regulation, which, moreover, relates only to the situation in which it is impossible for the Member States to proceed with any transfer of the asylum seekers to a particular Member State. In the event that, apart from the case referred to in that provision, the transfer of an asylum seeker to another Member State would result in an infringement of those fundamental requirements, the Member States are required to apply the discretionary clause laid down in Article 17(1) of the Dublin III Regulation.</p>

K. as part of the assessment of the situation in Croatia, but also should have verified whether the transfer to that Member State, considered in isolation, was compatible with Article 3 of the ECHR. By failing to assess the claims and the evidence submitted by the appellants in the main proceedings in that regard, that court disregarded their right, recognised by the Constitution of the Republic of Slovenia, to be accorded `equal protection in law'. On those grounds, the Ustavno sodišče (Constitutional Court) set aside the judgment of the Vrhovno sodišče (Supreme Court) and referred the case in the main proceedings back to that court for judgment in accordance with the considerations set out in its decision.</p>

            <p>52 By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 17(1) of the Dublin III Regulation must be interpreted as meaning that the question of the application, by a Member State, of the `discretionary clause' laid down in that provision is governed solely by national law and the interpretation given to it by the constitutional court of that Member State, or whether it is a question concerning the interpretation of EU law, within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU.</p>

          <content eId="para_1471__content">
            <p>In that respect, it must be recalled that the Court has already held, with regard to the `sovereignty clause' under Article 3(2) of the Dublin II Regulation, the terms of which coincide, in essence, with those of the `discretionary clause' laid down in Article 17(1) of the Dublin III Regulation and the interpretation of which is, accordingly, transposable to the latter, that the discretion which it allows the Member States is an integral part of the system for determining the Member State responsible developed by the EU legislature ( `the Dublin system'). It follows that a Member State implements EU law, within the meaning of Article 51(1) of the Charter, also when it makes use of that clause (see judgment of 21 December 2011, N. S. and Others, C‑411/10 and C‑493/10, EU:C:2011:865, paragraphs 64 to 68). Consequently, the application of the `discretionary clause' laid down in Article 17(1) of the Dublin III Regulation does indeed involve an interpretation of EU law, within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU.</p>

            <p>In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question is that Article 17(1) of the Dublin III Regulation must be interpreted as meaning that the question of the application, by a Member State, of the `discretionary clause' laid down in that provision is not governed solely by national law and by the interpretation given to it by the constitutional court of that Member State, but is a question concerning the interpretation of EU law, within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU.</p>

            </tblock>
            <p>55 By its second, third and fourth questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 4 of the Charter must be interpreted as meaning that, in circumstances in which the transfer of an asylum seeker with a particularly serious mental or physical illness would result in a real and proven risk of a significant and permanent deterioration in the state of health of the person concerned, that transfer would constitute inhuman and degrading treatment, within the meaning of that article. In the affirmative, the referring court expresses uncertainty as to whether the Member State concerned would be required to apply the `discretionary clause' laid down in Article 17(1) of that regulation and itself examine the asylum application at issue.</p>

S. and Others, C‑411/10 and C‑493/10, EU:C:2011:865, paragraphs 77 and 99). The prohibition of inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, laid down in Article 4 of the Charter, is, in that regard, of fundamental importance, to the extent that it is absolute in that it is closely linked to respect for human dignity, which is the subject of Article 1 of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 April 2016, Aranyosi and Căldăraru, C‑404/15 and C‑659/15 PPU, EU:C:2016:198, paragraphs 85 and 86).</p>

S. and Others ( C‑411/10 and C‑493/10, EU:C:2011:865, paragraphs 86 to 94 and 106), the Court stressed that the transfer of asylum seekers within the framework of the Dublin system may, in certain circumstances, be incompatible with the prohibition laid down in Article 4 of the Charter. It thus held that an asylum seeker would run a real risk of being subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment, within the meaning of that article, in the event of a transfer to a Member State in which there are substantial grounds for believing that there are systemic flaws in the asylum procedure and in the conditions for the reception of applicants. Consequently, in accordance with the prohibition laid down in that article, the Member States may not carry out transfers within the framework of the Dublin system to a Member State in the case where they cannot be unaware that such flaws exist in that Member State.</p>

They are, on the contrary, under an obligation to assess the risk that such consequences could occur when they decide to transfer the person concerned or, in the case of a court, the legality of a decision to transfer, since the execution of that decision may lead to inhuman or degrading treatment of that person (see, by analogy, judgment of 5 April 2016, Aranyosi and Căldăraru, C‑404/15 and C‑659/15 PPU, EU:C:2016:198, paragraph 88).</p>

K. is of such seriousness that there are substantial grounds for believing that her transfer would result for her in a real risk of inhuman or degrading treatment, within the meaning of Article 4 of the Charter. In the affirmative, it will be for the referring court to eliminate those grounds by ensuring that the precautions referred to in paragraphs 81 to 83 of the present judgment are taken before the transfer of C. K. or, if necessary, that the transfer of that person is suspended until her state of health permits it.</p>

            <p>In that context, the Commission's argument that it follows from Article 3(2) of the Dublin III Regulation that only the existence of systemic flaws in the Member State responsible is capable of affecting the obligation to transfer an asylum seeker to that Member State is unfounded.</p>

            <p>Nothing in the wording of that provision suggests that the intention of the EU legislature had been to regulate any circumstance other than that of systemic flaws preventing any transfer of asylum seekers to a particular Member State. That provision cannot, therefore, be interpreted as excluding the possibility that considerations linked to real and proven risks of inhuman or degrading treatment, within the meaning of Article 4 of the Charter, might, in exceptional situations such as those envisaged in the present judgment, have consequences for the transfer of a particular asylum seeker.</p>

            <p>Moreover, such a reading of Article 3(2) of the Dublin III Regulation would be, first, irreconcilable with the general character of Article 4 of the Charter, which prohibits inhuman or degrading treatment in all its forms. Secondly, it would be manifestly incompatible with the absolute character of that prohibition if the Member States could disregard a real and proven risk of inhuman or degrading treatment affecting an asylum seeker under the pretext that it does not result from a systemic flaw in the Member State responsible.</p>

            <p>Likewise, the interpretation of Article 4 of the Charter in the present judgment is not invalidated by the judgment of 10 December 2013, Abdullahi ( C‑394/12, EU:C:2013:813, paragraph 60), in which the Court held, with regard to the Dublin II Regulation, in essence, that, in circumstances such as those of the case giving rise to that judgment, the only way in which an asylum seeker could call his transfer into question was by pleading systemic flaws in the Member State responsible. Apart from the fact that the Court has held, as recalled in paragraph 62 of the present judgment, that, with regard to the rights enjoyed by an asylum seeker, the Dublin III Regulation differs in essential respects from the Dublin II Regulation, it must be recalled that that judgment was delivered in a case involving a national who had not claimed, before the Court of Justice, any particular circumstances indicating that his transfer would, in itself, be contrary to Article 4 of the Charter. The Court thereby merely recalled its previous judgment of 21 December 2011, N. S. and Others ( C‑411/10 and C‑493/10, EU:C:2011:865), concerning the impossibility of proceeding with any transfer of asylum seekers to a Member State experiencing systemic flaws in the asylum procedure or the conditions for their reception.</p>

            <p>Finally, that interpretation fully respects the principle of mutual trust since, far from affecting the existence of a presumption that fundamental rights are respected in each Member State, it ensures that the exceptional situations referred to in the present judgment are duly taken into account by the Member States. Moreover, if a Member State were to proceed with the transfer of an asylum seeker in such situations, the resulting inhuman and degrading treatment would not be attributable, directly or indirectly, to the authorities of the Member State responsible, but to the first Member State alone.</p>

            <p>In the light of all of the foregoing considerations, the answer to Questions 2, 3 and 4 is that Article 4 of the Charter must be interpreted as meaning that:</p>

If, taking into account the particular seriousness of the illness of the asylum seeker concerned, the taking of those precautions is not sufficient to ensure that his transfer does not result in a real risk of a significant and permanent worsening of his state of health, it is for the authorities of the Member State concerned to suspend the execution of the transfer of the person concerned for such time as his condition renders him unfit for such a transfer, and</p>

Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fifth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 17(1) of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person must be interpreted as meaning that the question of the application, by a Member State, of the `discretionary clause' laid down in that provision is not governed solely by national law and by the interpretation given to it by the constitutional court of that Member State, but is a question concerning the interpretation of EU law, within the meaning of Article 267 TFEU. 2. Article 4 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must be interpreted as meaning that:</p>
