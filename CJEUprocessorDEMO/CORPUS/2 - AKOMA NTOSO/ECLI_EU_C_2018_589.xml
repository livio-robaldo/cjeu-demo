            <p>On 12 December 2017, the Amtsgericht Bremen (District Court, Bremen, Germany) made an order on the basis of the European arrest warrant issued on 31 October 2017 placing ML in detention whilst awaiting his possible surrender to the Hungarian authorities. ML did not consent to his surrender.</p>

However, as the Hungarian Ministry of Justice had mentioned in its letter of 20 September 2017 that ML might be transferred to other detention centres, the court deemed it necessary to send the Ministry a request for information comprising a list of 78 questions concerning the conditions in which persons are detained in Budapest prison as well as in other detention centres to which ML might be transferred.</p>

            <p>To that end, the referring court raises the question, in the first place, of the extent of the assessment that it is required to undertake, in view of the fact that there is now a legal remedy in Hungary enabling prisoners to challenge the conditions of their detention in the light of the fundamental rights. More specifically, it wonders whether that remedy makes it possible to rule out all real risk of inhuman or degrading treatment when there is -- -- as is clear, inter alia, from the judgment of the ECtHR of 10 March 2015, Varga and Others v. Hungary(CE:ECHR:2015:0310JUD001409712, §§ 79 to 92) -- -- evidence of systemic or generalised deficiencies as regards detention conditions in Hungary. In that regard, the referring court is uncertain about the effect of the fact that the European Court of Human Rights recently held, in its judgment of 14 November 2017, Domján v. Hungary(CE:ECHR:2017:1114DEC000543317, § 22), that nothing proved that the remedy concerned was not going to offer realistic prospects of improving unsuitable conditions of detention in order to ensure compliance with the requirements arising under Article 3 ECHR.</p>

            <p>Should the legal remedy in question not avert the risk of a prisoner being subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment as a result of the conditions of his detention, the referring court enquires, in the second place, about the extent, in view of the information and assurances obtained from the Hungarian authorities, of any obligation it may have to review the arrangements for and conditions of detention in all the prisons in which ML might be held.</p>

            <p>In that regard, the referring court is uncertain, first of all, whether the assessment of detention conditions must concern all the prisons in which ML might be held, including those used on a transitional or temporary basis, or whether the review may be limited to those in which, according to the information provided by the issuing Member State, ML is likely to be incarcerated for most of the time. Although the referring court is able to rule out all risk of inhuman or degrading treatment at Szombathely prison, the Hungarian authorities have not provided enough information for such a finding to be made with regard to Budapest prison or the other detention centres to which they may, having left themselves that option, subsequently decide to transfer ML. That court also raises the question of the extent of the assessment to be made in this regard and the criteria to be used. In particular, it is uncertain whether it must take into account the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, as stated in its judgment of 20 October 2016, Muršić v. Croatia(CE:ECHR:2016:1020JUD000733413).</p>

            <p>Moreover, in the event of the executing judicial authorities being required to assess all the prisons in which ML might be detained, the referring court raises the question, first, of whether it may be satisfied with the general statements made by the Hungarian authorities that ML will not be exposed to a risk of inhuman or degrading treatment, or whether it may make ML's surrender subject to the sole condition that he will not be exposed to such treatment. Should that not be the case, the referring court asks, first, what significance it should attach to the fact that the Hungarian authorities have stated that ML's `transitional' detention will not exceed three weeks, given that the statement is expressed subject to the reservation `circumstances permitting'. Secondly, it wishes to ascertain whether it may take into account information when it is not possible to determine whether that information has been provided by the issuing judicial authority within the meaning of Article 6(1) of the Framework Decision or by a central authority within the meaning of Article 7(1) of that decision, acting in response to a request by the issuing judicial authority.</p>

            <p>In the field governed by the Framework Decision, the principle of mutual recognition, which, as is apparent in particular from recital 6 of that framework decision, constitutes the `cornerstone' of judicial cooperation in criminal matters, is applied in Article 1(2) thereof which lays down the rule that Member States are required to execute any European arrest warrant on the basis of the principle of mutual recognition and in accordance with the provisions of the framework decision. Executing judicial authorities may therefore, in principle, refuse to execute such a warrant only on the grounds for non-execution exhaustively listed by the framework decision and execution of the warrant may be made subject only to one of the conditions exhaustively laid down in Article 5. Accordingly, while execution of the European arrest warrant constitutes the rule, refusal to execute is intended to be an exception which must be interpreted strictly (judgment of today's date, Minister for Justice and Equality (Deficiencies in the System of Justice), C‑216/18 PPU, paragraph 41 and the case-law cited).</p>

The consequence of the execution of such a warrant must not be that that individual suffers inhuman or degrading treatment (judgment of 5 April 2016, Aranyosi and Căldăraru, C‑404/15 and C‑659/15 PPU, EU:C:2016:198, paragraph 88).</p>

That information may be obtained from, inter alia, judgments of international courts, such as judgments of the European Court of Human Rights, judgments of courts of the issuing Member State, and also decisions, reports and other documents produced by bodies of the Council of Europe or under the aegis of the United Nations (judgment of 5 April 2016, Aranyosi and Căldăraru, C‑404/15 and C‑659/15 PPU, EU:C:2016:198, paragraph 89).</p>

Hungary(CE:ECHR:2015:0310JUD001409712, §§ 79 to 92), that, as Hungary is experiencing prison overcrowding, there is a risk that the persons who are held there will be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment. That court considers that, at the date on which the order for reference was made, there continued to be such overcrowding, since, according to the Hungarian authorities, 1000 prison places had been created, whilst 5500 extra places were needed. The referring court also states that it is difficult to gauge the extent to which the possibility, introduced by the 2016 Law, of commuting imprisonment into house arrest has actually had an impact in reducing prison overcrowding in Hungary.</p>

            <p>Having regard to all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the questions referred is that Article 1(3), Article 5 and Article 6(1) of the Framework Decision must be interpreted as meaning that when the executing judicial authority has information showing there to be systemic or generalised deficiencies in the conditions of detention in the prisons of the issuing Member State, the accuracy of which must be verified by the referring court in the light of all the available updated data:</p>

                <p>the executing judicial authority cannot rule out the existence of a real risk that the person in respect of whom a European arrest warrant has been issued for the purpose of executing a custodial sentence will be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment within the meaning of Article 4 of the Charter, merely because that person has, in the issuing Member State, a legal remedy permitting him to challenge the conditions of his detention, although the existence of such a remedy may be taken into account by the executing judicial authority for the purpose of deciding on the surrender of the person concerned;</p>

                <p>the executing judicial authority is required to assess only the conditions of detention in the prisons in which, according to the information available to it, it is likely that that person will be detained, including on a temporary or transitional basis;</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules: Article 1(3), Article 5 and Article 6(1) of Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States, as amended by Council Framework Decision 2009/299/JHA of 26 February 2009, must be interpreted as meaning that when the executing judicial authority has information showing there to be systemic or generalised deficiencies in the conditions of detention in the prisons of the issuing Member State, the accuracy of which must be verified by the referring court in the light of all the available updated data:</p>
