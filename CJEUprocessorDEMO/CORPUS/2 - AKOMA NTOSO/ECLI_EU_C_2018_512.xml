            <p>From 1 November 2000, Ms Checa Honrado worked as a cleaner in the theme park `Terra Mítica' in Benidorm (Alicante, Spain). She was employed by Cespa SA until 1 March 2010, and then by Soroma patrimonial SL ( `Soroma'). She had a full-time contract of employment.</p>

            <p>According to the facts as set out by the referring court, that transfer meant that Ms Checa Honrado would have to change her place of residence, since there was a distance of more than 450 kilometres between the old and new workplaces. Ms Checa Honrado therefore opted to terminate her contract of employment, pursuant to Article 40 of the Workers' Statute. That option was accepted by Soroma.</p>

By decision of 16 September 2011, that court ordered Soroma to pay the sum of EUR 7 453.77 pursuant to Article 40 of the Workers' Statute.</p>

            <p>As Soroma executed that judgment only in part, Ms Checa Honrado applied for the opening of judicial enforcement proceedings. In the course of those proceedings, on 11 June 2013, Soroma was declared insolvent. The insolvency decision was notified to the Fogasa. Ms Checa Honrado thus requested the Fogasa to take over the amount of severance pay left outstanding by Soroma, owing to its insolvency. The Fogasa refused that request on the ground that severance pay arising from the termination of a contract of employment at the request of the worker affected by her employer's decision to change workplace is not guaranteed by Article 33(2) of the Workers' Statute.</p>

            <p>Hearing the case on appeal, the Tribunal Superior de Justicia de la Comunidad Valenciana (High Court of Justice of the Community of Valencia, Spain), which is the referring court, states that it harbours doubts as to the compatibility of Article 33(2) of the Workers' Statute with EU law, on the ground that this provision limits the guarantee of severance pay being taken over by the Fogasa in the cases of dismissal or termination of contract of employment regulated in Articles 50 to 52 of the statute. It states that the guarantee mechanism thus excludes claims arising from other legal forms of termination of the employment relationship that give rise to severance pay, such as that established in Article 40 of the statute, which, although presented as an option, in fact includes actual termination of the contract of employment on objective grounds.</p>

            <p>Referring to the judgment of 11 November 2015, Pujante Rivera ( C‑422/14, EU:C:2015:743), the referring court considers that Article 33(2) of the Workers' Statute ought to have included all the situations of termination of contract not attaching to the individual worker concerned. Accordingly, that provision of the statute, in not covering other legal forms of termination of the employment relationship that give rise to lawfully calculated severance pay, such as that established in Article 40 of the statute, constitutes an unjustified exclusion not authorised by Directive 2008/94.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the Tribunal Superior de Justicia de la Comunidad Valenciana (High Court of Justice of the Community of Valencia) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling: `May statutory severance pay payable by a company to a worker, on termination of the employment relationship as a consequence of a change to a fundamental element of the contract of employment, such as geographic mobility obliging the worker to change residence, be understood to constitute ``severance pay on termination of employment relationships '', as referred to in the first paragraph of Article 3 of Directive 2008/94?'</p>

            <p>By its question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the first paragraph of Article 3 of Directive 2008/94 must be interpreted as meaning that, where, according to the national legislation in question, some forms of statutory compensation payable on termination of a contract of employment at the worker's request and those payable in the case of dismissals on objective grounds, such as those envisaged by the referring court, fall within the concept of `severance pay on termination of employment relationships', within the meaning of that provision, statutory compensation payable on termination of a contract of employment at the worker's request on account of a transfer of workplace by the employer, obliging the worker to change residence, must also fall within that concept.</p>

            <p>However, the Court has repeatedly held that the power of national law, recognised by that directive, to specify the benefits payable by the guarantee institution is conditional upon the requirements flowing from the general principle of equality and non-discrimination (judgment of 21 February 2008, Robledillo Núñez, C‑498/06, EU:C:2008:109, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is apparent from the order for reference that Article 33(2) of the Workers' Statute explicitly provides for the guarantee of payment of compensation by the Fogasa for the cases of dismissal or termination of contract of employment laid down in Articles 50 to 52 of the statute, but does not cover other legal forms of termination of the employment relationship that give rise to statutory severance pay, which includes inter alia that laid down in Article 40 of the statute, pursuant to which the employment relationship at issue in the main proceedings was terminated.</p>

            <p>In that regard, the referring court points out, first of all, that Article 40 of the Workers' Statute provides that the transfer of workers, by the employer, to another workplace under the same employer and obliging those workers to change residence must be justified on economic, technical, organisational or production grounds and that, in such a case, the worker has the right to opt to terminate his contract of employment, in which case he will receive severance pay of 20 days' salary for every year worked.</p>

            <p>Next, it states that Articles 50 to 52 of the Workers' Statute, referred to in Article 33(2) of the statute, regulate, respectively, termination of the employment relationship by a worker, termination of the employment relationship as a result of a collective redundancy and termination of the employment relationship on objective grounds.</p>

            <p>More specifically, it is apparent from the order for reference that Article 50 of the Workers' Statute sets out the grounds that entitle the worker to request termination of the employment relationship, which include, inter alia, substantial changes in working conditions made by the employer without due regard for the provisions of Article 41 and adversely affecting the dignity of the worker and any other serious infringement of his obligations by the employer, and that the worker is entitled in such cases to the forms of compensation provided for in the case of improper dismissal.</p>

            <p>Article 51 of the Workers' Statute regulates collective redundancy, which concerns the termination of contracts of employment on economic, technical, organisational or production grounds, when it affects a minimum number of workers over a certain period. Article 52 of the statute regulates termination of the contract on objective grounds, including inter alia the worker's incompetence, the worker's failure to adapt to the technical changes made at his workplace and individual redundancies on objective grounds, namely economic, technical, organisational and production grounds.</p>

            <p>Finally, the referring court states that the termination of the employment relationship laid down in Article 40 of the Workers' Statute is an actual termination of the contract of employment on objective grounds, in so far as that provision requires economic, technical, organisational or production grounds justifying a substantial change to the working conditions, and because the option given to the worker to terminate the employment relationship is linked to the clear damage involved by changing his place of work, which necessarily means changing residence.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, it must be considered that workers who opt to terminate the employment relationship pursuant to Article 40 of the Workers' Statute are in a situation comparable to that of workers who opt to terminate the employment relationship pursuant to Article 50 of the Workers' Statute, in so far as they choose that termination as a result of the fact that the employer is making substantial changes to their working conditions which, in the view of the Spanish legislature, may not be forced upon the workers, as it has provided, in both cases, that the worker may opt to terminate the contract of employment and would also receive compensation.</p>

            <p>It must also be stated that workers whose employment relationship has been terminated pursuant to Article 40 of the Workers' Statute are in a situation comparable to that of workers made redundant on one of the objective grounds set out in Articles 50 to 52 of the statute, in so far as it is apparent from the order for reference that termination of the employment relationship on the basis of Article 40 is also regarded as termination of the contract of employment on objective grounds.</p>

            <p>The difference in treatment thus afforded by Article 33(2) to workers whose claims result from compensation for termination of the employment relationship based on Article 40 of the Workers' Statute can therefore be accepted, in accordance with the case-law recalled in paragraph 32 above, only if it is objectively justified (see also, to that effect, judgment of 16 December 2004, Olaso Valero, C‑520/03, EU:C:2004:826, paragraph 36 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In that regard, the argument put forward by the Spanish Government that, in essence, the discretion left to Member States by Directive 2008/94 permits the Spanish legislature to opt for the guarantee institution to take over only `severance pay for termination of the contract of employment for reasons beyond the control of the worker' and that institution therefore does not guarantee claims arising from a voluntary choice on the part of the worker concerned, cannot be accepted.</p>

            <p>In actual fact, that argument seeks to challenge the comparability of the situations of workers who have opted to terminate their contracts of employment pursuant to Article 40 of the Workers' Statute, on the one hand, and workers whose contract of employment has been terminated pursuant to Articles 50 to 52 of the statute, on the other. It is apparent from the order for reference that termination of a contract of employment pursuant to Article 40 cannot be regarded as stemming from the worker's choice, since it is the consequence of the fact that the employer intends to make a change to the worker's contract of employment as substantial as a transfer of workplace to a distance obliging the worker to change residence and that the law provides for the payment of compensation by the employer where the worker refuses to accept that transfer and opts to terminate the employment relationship.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, it must be noted that the Spanish Government, questioned in that regard by the Court, has not provided any information liable to justify the different treatment in the Fogasa's taking over of claims resulting from the compensation laid down in Article 40 of the Workers' Statute and claims resulting from the compensation laid down in Articles 50 to 52 of the statute.</p>

            <p>The interpretation of the first paragraph of Article 3 of Directive 2008/94 defended by the Spanish Government is not, moreover, compatible with the social objective of that directive, which is, as follows from Article 1(1) thereof, read in conjunction with recital 3 of the directive, to guarantee employees a minimum of protection at EU level in the event of the employer's insolvency through payment of outstanding claims resulting from contracts of employment or employment relationships (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 March 2017, Eschenbrenner, C‑496/15, EU:C:2017:152, paragraph 52 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Furthermore, it must be recalled, first, that Article 1(2) of Directive 2008/94 provides that Member States may, by way of exception, exclude claims by certain categories of employee from the scope of the directive, by virtue of the existence of other forms of guarantee if it is established that these offer the persons concerned a degree of protection equivalent to that resulting from the directive. Secondly, Article 12(a) of the directive permits Member States to take the measures necessary to avoid abuses.</p>

            <p>However, it must be noted that it is not apparent from the file submitted to the Court and, in particular, the observations of the Spanish Government, that circumstances such as those of the case in the main proceedings would be regarded as being exceptional within the meaning of Article 1(2) of Directive 2008/94 or as constituting an abuse for the purposes of applying Article 12(a) of the directive.</p>

            <p>Consequently, the answer to the question referred is that the first paragraph of Article 3 of Directive 2008/94 must be interpreted as meaning that, where, according to the national legislation in question, some forms of statutory compensation payable on termination of a contract of employment at the worker's request and those payable in the case of dismissals on objective grounds, such as those envisaged by the referring court, fall within the concept of `severance pay on termination of employment relationships', within the meaning of that provision, statutory compensation payable on termination of a contract of employment at the worker's request on account of a transfer of workplace by the employer, obliging the worker to change residence, must also fall within that concept.</p>
