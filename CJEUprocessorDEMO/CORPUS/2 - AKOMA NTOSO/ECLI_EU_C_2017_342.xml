            <p>During the landing of the flight from Burgas to Brno, according to Travel Service, the aircraft collided with a bird and so the aircraft was subject to checks, although no damage was found. Nonetheless, a Travel Service technician was taken by private aircraft from Slaný (Czech Republic) to Brno to put the aircraft back in operation. He was told by the aircraft's crew that the checks had already been performed by another firm but its authorisation to carry out the checks was not accepted by Sunwing, the owner of the aircraft. Travel Service once again checked the point of impact, which had earlier been cleaned, and found no traces on the engines or other parts of the aircraft.</p>

            <p>By application lodged on 26 November 2013 at the Obvodní soud pro Prahu 6 (Prague 6 District Court), the applicants in the main proceedings each claimed payment of a sum of around CZK 6825 (6825 Czech Crowns, approximately EUR 250) under Article 7(1)(a) of Regulation No 261/2004. By decision of 22 May 2014, that court upheld their claim on the ground that the facts of the case could not be considered `extraordinary circumstances' within the meaning of Article 5(3) of that regulation since the choice of procedure to return an aircraft to service following a technical problem, such as a collision with a bird, lay with Travel Service. In that regard, the Obvodní soud pro Prahu 6 (Prague 6 District Court) added that Travel Service had not established that it had done all it could to prevent a delay to the flight, since it merely stated that `it was necessary' after the aircraft suffered the collision with a bird to wait for the arrival of the authorised technician.</p>

By decision of 20 November 2014, the Ústavní soud (Constitutional Court) upheld the appeal and set aside the decision of the Obvodní soud pro Prahu 6 (Prague 6 District Court) on the ground that it had infringed Travel Service's fundamental right to a fair hearing and the fundamental right to a hearing before the proper statutory court, since, as a court of last instance, it was required to refer a question for a preliminary ruling to the Court under Article 267 TFEU, given that the answer to the question of whether the collision of an aircraft with a bird, combined with other technical difficulties, should be classified as `extraordinary circumstances' within the meaning of Article 5(3) of Regulation No 261/2004 was not clear from either that regulation or the Court's case-law.</p>

            <p>The case was referred back to the Obvodní soud pro Prahu 6 (Prague 6 District Court). That court is doubtful as to whether, if a collision between an aircraft and a bird is classified under the concept of an `event' within the meaning of paragraph 22 of the judgment of 22 December 2008, Wallentin-Hermann ( C‑549/07, EU:C:2008:771), or under that of `extraordinary circumstances' within the meaning of recital 14 of that regulation, as interpreted by the judgment of 31 January 2013, McDonagh ( C‑12/11, EU:C:2013:43), or whether those two concepts overlap. It entertains doubts, next, as to whether such events are inherent in the normal exercise of the activity of air transport, having regard, firstly, to their frequency and, secondly, to the fact that a carrier can neither foresee nor control them, that control being exercised by the managers of airports. It also asks whether technical failures consequent upon such a collision and the administrative and technical measures taken to deal with them must also be regarded as extraordinary circumstances and to what extent they may be regarded as necessary. Finally, it is doubtful as to how a delay of or greater than three hours is to be assessed when it is caused, as in the main proceedings, by a combination of several factors, namely the repair of a technical failure, then the checking procedures necessary after a collision with a bird.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the Obvodní soud pro Prahu 6 (Prague 6 District Court) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling: `1. Is a collision between an aircraft and a bird an event within the meaning of paragraph 22 of the judgment of 22 December 2008, Wallentin-Hermann ( C‑549/07, EU:C:2008:771), or does it constitute extraordinary circumstances within the meaning of recital 14 of [Regulation No 261/2004], or is it impossible to classify it under either of those concepts? 2. If the collision between an aircraft and a bird constitutes extraordinary circumstances within the meaning of recital 14 of [Regulation No 261/2004], may preventative control systems established in particular around airports (such as sonic bird deterrents, cooperation with ornithologists, the elimination of spaces where birds typically gather or fly, using light as a deterrent and so on) be considered to be reasonable measures to be taken by the air carrier to avoid such a collision? What in this case constitutes the event within the meaning of paragraph 22 of [the judgment of 22 December 2008, Wallentin-Hermann ( C‑549/07, EU:C:2008:771)]? 3. If a collision between an aircraft and a bird is an event within the meaning of paragraph 22 of [the judgment of 22 December 2008, Wallentin-Hermann ( C‑549/07, EU:C:2008:771)], may it also be considered to be an event within the meaning of recital 14 of [Regulation No 261/2004], and may, in such a case, the body of technical and administrative measures which an air carrier must implement following a collision between an aircraft and a bird which nevertheless did not result in damage to the aircraft be considered to constitute exceptional circumstances within the meaning of recital 14 of that regulation? 4. If the body of technical and administrative measures taken following a collision between an aircraft and a bird which nevertheless did not result in damage to the aircraft constitutes exceptional circumstances within the meaning of recital 14 of [Regulation No 261/2004], is it permissible to require, as reasonable measures, the air carrier to take into consideration, when it schedules flights, the risk that it will be necessary to take such technical and administrative measures following a collision between an aircraft and a bird and to make provision for that fact in the flight schedule? 5. How must the obligation on the air carrier to pay compensation, as provided for in Article 7 of [Regulation No 261/2004], be assessed where the delay is caused not only by administrative and technical measures adopted following a collision between the aircraft and a bird which did not result in damage to the aircraft, but also to a significant extent by repairing a technical problem unconnected with that collision?'</p>

            <p>18 By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 5(3) of Regulation No 261/2004, read in the light of recital 14 of that regulation, must be interpreted as meaning that a collision between an aircraft and a bird is classified under the concept of `extraordinary circumstances' within the meaning of that provision.</p>

            <p>Thus, the Court has deduced therefrom that events may be classified as extraordinary circumstances, within the meaning of Article 5(3) of Regulation No 261/2004, if, by their nature or origin, they are not inherent in the normal exercise of the activity of the air carrier concerned and are outside that carrier's actual control (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 December 2008, Wallentin-Hermann, C‑549/07, EU:C:2008:771, paragraph 23; of 31 January 2013, McDonagh, C‑12/11, EU:C:2013:43, paragraph 29; and of 17 September 2015, van der Lans, C‑257/14, EU:C:2015:618, paragraph 36).</p>

            <p>Conversely, it is clear from the Court's case-law that the premature failure of certain parts of an aircraft does not constitute extraordinary circumstances, since such a breakdown remains intrinsically linked to the operating system of the aircraft. That unexpected event is not outside the actual control of the air carrier, since it is required to ensure the maintenance and proper functioning of the aircraft it operates for the purposes of its business (see, to that effect, judgment of 17 September 2015, van der Lans, C‑257/14, EU:C:2015:618, paragraphs 41 and 43).</p>

            <p>In the present case, a collision between an aircraft and a bird, as well as any damage caused by that collision, since they are not intrinsically linked to the operating system of the aircraft, are not by their nature or origin inherent in the normal exercise of the activity of the air carrier concerned and are outside its actual control. Accordingly, that collision must be classified as `extraordinary circumstances' within the meaning of Article 5(3) of Regulation No 261/2004.</p>

            <p>It is clear from the order for reference that, following a collision with a bird, the aircraft concerned, operated by Travel Service, underwent, after landing, a safety check carried out by an authorised firm without any damage being found on the aircraft. Nonetheless, Travel Service sent a technician to the location to carry out a second safety check, since the owner of the aircraft refused to recognise the authorisation of the firm which carried out the initial check.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be noted that it is for the air carrier, faced with extraordinary circumstances, such as the collision of its aircraft with a bird, to adopt measures appropriate to the situation, deploying all its resources in terms of staff or equipment and the financial means at its disposal in order to avoid, as far as possible, the cancellation or delay of its flights.</p>

            <p>Thus, although Regulation No 261/2004 does not infringe the freedom of air carriers to use the experts of their choice to carry out the checks necessitated by a collision with a bird, the fact remains that, when a check has already been carried out after such a collision by an expert authorised to do so under the applicable rules, which it is for the referring court to ascertain, the view cannot be taken that a second check inevitably leading to a delay equal to or in excess of three hours to the arrival of the flight concerned constitutes a measure appropriate to the situation for the purposes of the case-law cited in paragraph 28 of this judgment.</p>

Such compensation may accordingly reduce or even remove the financial burden borne by carriers in consequence of those obligations (judgment of 17 September 2015, van der Lans, C‑257/14, EU:C:2015:618, paragraph 46 and the case-law cited).</p>

Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 295/91, read in the light of recital 14 thereof, must be interpreted as meaning that a collision between an aircraft and a bird is classified under the concept of `extraordinary circumstances' within the meaning of that provision. 2. Article 5(3) of Regulation No 261/2004, read in the light of recital 14 thereof, must be interpreted as meaning that cancellation or delay of a flight is not due to extraordinary circumstances when that cancellation or delay is the result of the use by the air carrier of an expert of its choice to carry out fresh safety checks necessitated by a collision with a bird after those checks have already been carried out by an expert authorised under the applicable rules. 3. Article 5(3) of Regulation No 261/2004, read in the light of recital 14 thereof, must be interpreted as meaning that the `reasonable measures' which an air carrier must take in order to reduce or even prevent the risks of collision with a bird and thus be released from its obligation to compensate passengers under Article 7 of Regulation No 261/2004 include control measures preventing the presence of such birds provided that, in particular at the technical and administrative levels, such measures can actually be taken by that air carrier, that those measures do not require it to make intolerable sacrifices in the light of the capacities of its undertaking and that that carrier has shown that those measures were actually taken as regards the flight affected by the collision with a bird, it being for the referring court to satisfy itself that those conditions have been met. 4. Article 5(3) of Regulation No 261/2004, read in the light of recital 14 thereof, must be interpreted as meaning that, in the event of a delay to a flight equal to or in excess of three hours in arrival caused not only by extraordinary circumstances, which could not have been avoided by measures appropriate to the situation and which were subject to all reasonable measures by the air carrier to avoid the consequences thereof, but also in other circumstances not in that category, the delay caused by the first event must be deducted from the total length of the delay in arrival of the flight concerned in order to assess whether compensation for the delay in arrival of that flight must be paid as provided for in Article 7 of that regulation.</p>
