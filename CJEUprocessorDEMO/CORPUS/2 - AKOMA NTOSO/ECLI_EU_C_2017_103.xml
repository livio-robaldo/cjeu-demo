The expression ``foodstuffs or other substances with nutritive value '' also includes certain other products, inter alia products of Chapter 28 used as mineral supplements in food preparations, sugar alcohols of heading 29.05, essential amino acids of heading 29.22, lecithin of heading 29.23, provitamins and vitamins of heading 29.36, sugars of heading 29.40, animal blood fractions of heading 30.02 for use in food preparations, casein and caseinates of heading 35.01, albumins of heading 35.02, edible gelatin of heading 35.03, edible protein substances of heading 35.04, dextrins and other edible modified starches of heading 35.05, sorbitol of heading 38.24, edible products of Chapter 39 (such as amylopectin and amylose of heading 39.13).

Substances having a nutritive value that is merely incidental to their function as chemical products, e.g., as food additives or processing aids, are not regarded as ``foodstuffs or substances with nutritive value '' for the purpose of this Note. The mixtures which are excluded from Chapter 38 by virtue of Note 1(b) are those which are of a kind used in the preparation of human foodstuffs and which are valued for their nutritional qualities.'</p>

It states, first, that the starch content of the product at issue exceeds 5% of its total weight and, secondly, that the starch is not added because of its nutritional properties but serves simply as a processing aid in order to improve the suitability of calcium carbonate for use in calcium tablets. Any minimal nutritive value of the added starch is incidental.</p>

            <p>Madaus submits that, having regard to the foregoing, the product at issue falls within the scope of Chapter 38 of the CN. The exclusion of certain products from the scope of that chapter, provided for in Note 1(b) thereto relating to `mixtures of chemicals with foodstuffs or other substances with nutritive value', does not apply to the product at issue in the main proceedings since it is not a mixture composed inter alia of a foodstuff or other substance with nutritive value. In accordance with the Explanatory Notes to the HS on Chapter 38, the mere presence of foodstuffs or other substances with nutritive value, such as the modified starch in the present case, in a mixture would not suffice to exclude the mixture from the scope of Chapter 38 of the CN, given that, according to those Explanatory Notes, a substance having a nutritive value that incidental to its function as a processing aid is not regarded as a substance with nutritive value. Madaus adds, lastly, that Implementing Regulation No 328/2013 is invalid on the grounds that it misinterprets the scope of Note 1(b) to Chapter 38 of the CN.</p>

            <p>That court takes the view that the product at issue in the main proceedings falls within the scope of Chapter 38 of the CN, since the main component, calcium carbonate, is a chemical product whereas the modified starch was added merely in order to improve the suitability of the former for use in calcium tablets. As a result, it considers that the modified starch is included in the product at issue in the main proceedings merely to serve as a processing aid and not in order to confer on that product nutritive value.</p>

            <p>The referring court relies in this connection on the Explanatory Notes to Chapter 38 of the HS, as they are set out in paragraph 18 above, according to which, as the referring court states `the mere presence of a substance with nutritive value in a mixture is not sufficient to exclude that mixture from Chapter 38 by virtue of Note 1(b) to that Chapter where the nutritive value of the substance is merely incidental to its function as a chemical product'.</p>

            <p>It nevertheless has doubts as regards whether the product at issue in the main proceedings may fall within the scope of Chapter 38 of the CN in the light of Implementing Regulation No 328/2013. It states that that regulation refers to Note 1(b) to Chapter 38, by virtue of which certain mixtures of chemicals with foodstuffs or other substances with nutritive value are excluded from that chapter. Thus, a product comparable to that at issue in the main proceedings would fall within the scope of Chapter 21 of the CN, and should therefore be classified under heading 2106 of that nomenclature, and not in Chapter 38 thereof. The referring court considers that the regulation concerned could be invalid on the same grounds as those which seem to that court to warrant classification of the product at issue in the main proceedings in Chapter 38 of the CN and, accordingly, on the grounds that it misinterprets the scope of Note 1(b) to that chapter.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the Finanzgericht Bremen (Finance Court, Bremen) decided to stay the proceedings and refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling: `Is the [CN] to be interpreted as meaning that a raw material with the designation ``DESTAB Calcium Carbonate 90SE Ultra 250 '', used for the manufacture of calcium tablets in the form of simple tablets, effervescent tablets and chewable tablets, consisting of chemically defined calcium carbonate in powder form and, to improve suitability for use in tablets, added modified starch, and with a starch content -- determined in accordance with Commission Regulation (EU) No 118/2010 of 9 February 2010 amending Regulation (EC) No 900/2008 laying down the methods of analysis and other technical provisions necessary for the application of the arrangements for imports of certain goods resulting from the processing of agricultural products ( OJ 2010 L 37, p. 21) -- of less than 5% by weight, is to be classified under subheading 3824 90 97 [of the CN]?'</p>

            <p>By its question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the CN must be interpreted to the effect that a product, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, used for the manufacture of calcium tablets in the form of simple tablets, effervescent tablets and chewable tablets, consisting of chemically defined calcium carbonate in powder form and, to improve suitability for use in tablets, added modified starch, and with a starch content of less than 5% by weight, must be classified under heading 2106 of that nomenclature, as a food preparation, or under heading 3824 thereof, as a chemical product.</p>

            <p>First of all, it must be pointed out that, when the Court is requested to give a preliminary ruling on a matter of tariff classification, its task is to provide the national court with guidance on the criteria which will enable the latter to classify the products at issue correctly in the CN, rather than to effect that classification itself, a fortiori since the Court does not necessarily have available to it all the information which is essential in that regard. In any event the national court is in a better position to do so (judgment of 17 September 2015, Kyowa Hakko Europe, C‑344/14, EU:C:2015:615, paragraph 24 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Next, it should be noted that, according to the Court's settled case-law, in the interests of legal certainty and ease of verification, the decisive criterion for the classification of goods for customs purposes is in general to be sought in their objective characteristics and properties as defined in the wording of the relevant heading of the CN and in the section or chapter notes (judgment of 17 February 2016, Salutas Pharma, C‑124/15, EU:C:2016:87, paragraph 29 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Thus, the chapter notes to the CN constitute important means for ensuring the uniform application of the common customs tariff and provide, as such, useful information for its interpretation. The content of those notes must therefore be consistent with the provisions of the CN and cannot modify its scope (judgment of 17 February 2016, Salutas Pharma, C‑124/15, EU:C:2016:87, paragraph 30).</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the explanatory notes drawn up by the Commission as regards the CN and by the WCO as regards the HS are an important aid to the interpretation of the scope of the various tariff headings but do not have legally binding force (judgment of 17 February 2016, Salutas Pharma, C‑124/15, EU:C:2016:87, paragraph 31 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Finally, for the purposes of classification under the appropriate heading, it should also be recalled that the intended use of a product may constitute an objective criterion for classification if it is inherent to the product, and that inherent character must be capable of being assessed on the basis of the product's objective characteristics and properties (judgments of 20 June 2013, Agroferm, C‑568/11, EU:C:2013:407, paragraph 41, and of 4 March 2015, Oliver Medical, C‑547/13, EU:C:2015:139, paragraph 47). However, the intended use of the product is a relevant criterion only where the classification cannot be made on the sole basis of the objective characteristics and properties of the product (judgments of 16 December 2010, Skoma-Lux, C‑339/09, EU:C:2010:781, paragraph 47, and of 28 April 2016, Oniors Bio, C‑233/15, EU:C:2016:305, paragraph 33).</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is apparent from the order for reference that the product at issue in the main proceedings is composed of calcium carbonate, a chemical product, and modified starch, a substance with nutritive value, in the proportions of approximately 95% and 5% respectively. The product at issue in the main proceedings is used as a raw material in the manufacture of calcium tablets intended as a human foodstuff. Consequently, having regard to the objective characteristics and properties of the product at issue, in principle it falls within the scope of Chapter 38 of the CN on `Miscellaneous chemical products'.</p>

            <p>Secondly, the last sentence of the last paragraph of the Explanatory Notes to the HS on Chapter 38 thereof states that mixtures which are excluded from that chapter `are those which are of a kind used in the preparation of human foodstuffs and which are valued for their nutritional qualities'.</p>

Thus, the fact that a substance such as calcium carbonate is a chemical product does not prevent it from being regarded as a substance with nutritive value.</p>
