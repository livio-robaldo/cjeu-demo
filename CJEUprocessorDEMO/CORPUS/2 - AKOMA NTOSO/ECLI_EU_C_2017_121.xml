                <p>A number of substantive changes are to be made to Directive 2000/35/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 June 2000 on combating late payment in commercial transactions [ OJ 2000 L 200, p. 35].

                <p>Late payment constitutes a breach of contract which has been made financially attractive to debtors in most Member States by low or no interest rates charged on late payments and/or slow procedures for redress. A decisive shift to a culture of prompt payment, including one in which the exclusion of the right to charge interest should always be considered to be a grossly unfair contractual term or practice, is necessary to reverse this trend and to discourage late payment. Such a shift should also include the introduction of specific provisions on payment periods and on the compensation of creditors for the costs incurred, and, inter alia, that the exclusion of the right to compensation for recovery costs should be presumed to be grossly unfair. ...</p>

                <p>This Directive should prohibit abuse of freedom of contract to the disadvantage of the creditor. As a result, where a term in a contract or a practice relating to the date or period for payment, the rate of interest for late payment or the compensation for recovery costs is not justified on the grounds of the terms granted to the debtor, or it mainly serves the purpose of procuring the debtor additional liquidity at the expense of the creditor, it may be regarded as constituting such an abuse. For that purpose, ... any contractual term or practice which grossly deviates from good commercial practice and is contrary to good faith and fair dealing should be regarded as unfair to the creditor. In particular, the outright exclusion of the right to charge interest should always be considered as grossly unfair, whereas the exclusion of the right to compensation for recovery costs should be presumed to be grossly unfair. This Directive should not affect national provisions relating to the way contracts are concluded or regulating the validity of contractual terms which are unfair to the debtor.'</p>

            <p>It is apparent from the documents submitted to the Court that the Spanish legislature put in place, from 2012, an `extraordinary financing mechanism for payment of suppliers', for a limited period, in order to deal with the delays which had been built up, because of the economic crisis, by the Autonomous Communities and local bodies in paying their suppliers (the `extraordinary financing mechanism'). In essence, under the rules governing the functioning of that mechanism, suppliers who join that mechanism agree, in exchange for immediate payment of the principal debt, to waive related sums owed on account of the failure by the public administrations concerned to respect the payment periods, including, inter alia, interest for late payment and compensation for recovery costs.</p>

The national courts alone are competent to decide on the interpretation of domestic law (judgment of 27 October 2016, Audace and Others, C‑114/15, EU:C:2016:813, paragraph 65 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Consequently, in so far as the referring court infers from its interpretation of Spanish law that Directive 2011/7 applies to the facts at issue in the main proceedings, the questions referred, as raised by the referring court, must be answered.</p>

              <p>The first and second questions</p>
            </tblock>
            <p>23 By its first and second questions, which should be examined together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Directive 2011/7, and in particular Article 7(2) and (3) thereof, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which allows a creditor to waive his right to interest for late payment and to compensation for recovery costs in return for immediate payment of the principal amount of the debt owed.</p>

            <p>In order to answer those questions, it must be noted that, in accordance with Article 1(1) of Directive 2011/7, the aim of that directive is to combat late payment in commercial transactions, that delay constituting, according to recital 12 of that directive, a breach of contract which has been made financially attractive to debtors because, inter alia, low or no interest is charged on late payments.</p>

            <p>In order to achieve that aim, Directive 2011/7 does not, however, harmonise fully all of the rules relating to late payments in commercial transactions (see, by analogy with Directive 2000/35, judgment of 15 December 2016, Nemec, C‑256/15, EU:C:2016:954, paragraph 46 and case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Like Directive 2000/35, Directive 2011/7 lays down only certain rules in this area, which include those relating to interest for late payment.</p>

            <p>In that regard, the Member States must, in accordance with Article 4(1) and Article 6 of Directive 2011/7, ensure that, in commercial transactions where the debtor is a public authority, a creditor who has met his obligations, and who has not received the amount owed on time, has the right to obtain interest for late payment as well as compensation for the recovery costs which he has incurred, unless the debtor is not responsible for the delay.</p>

            <p>To that end, Article 7(1) of that directive does, it is true, require the Member States to provide that a contractual term or a practice relating, in particular, to the rate of interest for late payment or the compensation for recovery costs is either unenforceable or is to give rise to a claim for damages if it is grossly unfair to the creditor. Furthermore, Article 7 provides that any contractual term or practice which excludes the payment of that interest for late payment or the compensation for recovery costs must be considered, according to Article 7(2), or presumed, according to Article 7(3), to be grossly unfair.</p>

            <p>However, it is apparent from those provisions that they do no more than guarantee that the circumstances envisaged in, inter alia, Article 4(1) and Article 6 of Directive 2011/7 grant the creditor the right to demand interest for late payment and compensation for recovery costs. As is apparent from recital 28 of that directive, the impossibility of excluding such a right by contractual means is intended to prevent abuse of the freedom of contract to the disadvantage of the creditor, who, at the time when the contract is entered into, is not in a position to renounce such a right.</p>

            <p>In other words, the purpose of Article 7(2) and (3) of Directive 2011/7 is to prevent the creditor's waiver of the right to interest for late payment or to compensation for recovery costs from occurring at the time when the contract is entered into, that is to say, at the time of the exercise of the creditor's freedom of contract and therefore of the possible risk of an abuse of that freedom by the debtor to the disadvantage of the creditor.</p>

            <p>By contrast, when, as in the case in the main proceedings, the conditions laid down in Directive 2011/7 are met and the interest for late payment and the compensation for recovery costs are payable, the creditor, having regard to his freedom of contract, must remain free to waive the sums owed in respect of that interest and compensation, inter alia, in exchange for immediate payment of the principal sum.</p>

            <p>This is, moreover, confirmed by recital 16 of Directive 2011/7, which states that the directive should not oblige a creditor to claim interest for late payment.</p>

            <p>Consequently, as the Advocate General notes in essence in point 62 of her Opinion, there is nothing in Directive 2011/7 to suggest that it prohibits the creditor from freely waiving the right to demand interest for late payment and compensation for recovery costs.</p>

            <p>In the light of all of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first and second questions is that Directive 2011/7, and Article 7(2) and (3) thereof in particular, must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which allows a creditor to waive his right to interest for late payment and compensation for recovery costs in exchange for immediate payment of the principal amount of debts owed, on condition that such a waiver is freely agreed to, this being a matter for the referring court to verify.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fifth Chamber) hereby rules: Directive 2011/7/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 on combating late payment in commercial transactions, and Article 7(2) and (3) thereof in particular, must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which allows a creditor to waive his right to interest for late payment and compensation for recovery costs in exchange for immediate payment of the principal amount of debts owed, on condition that such a waiver is freely agreed to, this being a matter for the referring court to verify.</p>
