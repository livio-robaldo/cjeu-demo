            <p>It is not in dispute that a subscription agreement relating to financial instruments does constitute such an agreement. As to the fact that, in the context of the service of `execution of orders', the agreement is concluded `on behalf of clients', those words could admittedly suggest, in the abstract, that a credit institution cannot be regarded as providing that service to a client when its role in the conclusion of the agreement is not limited to that of an intermediary and it is also party to the agreement, as issuer of the financial instruments which the client wishes to acquire.</p>

            <p>Those words must, however, be placed in their context.

In accordance with point 6 of Article 4(1) of MiFID, that activity consists in trading against proprietary capital resulting in the conclusion of transactions in one or more financial instruments.</p>

            <p>It is apparent from this that MiFID is based on a clear division between, on the one hand, the conclusion of agreements for the purchase or sale of financial instruments by credit institutions and investment firms for their own benefit, employing their own capital, and, on the other, the conclusion of such agreements by those institutions and firms for the benefit of their clients, employing their clients' capital. Seen in this light, an agreement of such a kind must be regarded as being concluded by a credit institution `on behalf of' clients, within the meaning of point 5 of Article 4(1) of MiFID and point 2 of Section A of Annex I thereto, where a client is the beneficiary thereof and employs his capital, even when that institution is also party to the agreement as issuer of the instruments concerned.</p>

Consequently, claims relating to money transferred by those clients to that institution in connection with those agreements are capable of being covered by investor-compensation schemes, in accordance with the first indent of the second subparagraph of Article 2(2) of Directive 97/9.</p>

            <p>It is true that, as the Advocate General has observed in point 134 of his Opinion, Directive 97/9 does not have the aim of protecting investors from the risks inherent in all investment. In particular, that directive is not intended to protect investors against the insolvency of the companies that have issued the financial instruments which they own. On that basis, the risk of insolvency of the issuer cannot be covered by that directive simply because, in the case of a given investment transaction, the issuer happens to be a credit institution or an investment firm.</p>

            <p>In such circumstances, it is not the loss of value of financial instruments held by an investor, or the inability of their issuer to repay the investor the money that they represent, that is at issue. On the other hand, what is at issue is the inability of a credit institution, acting as an investment firm, to supply such instruments to the clients wishing to acquire ownership of them and, therefore, to meet its obligations to them. This situation constitutes materialisation of the risk covered by Directive 97/9.</p>

In the light of those objectives, and as the Commission maintains, it is essential that the money which an investment firm or credit institution holds for an investor wishing to acquire financial instruments, before issue of those instruments, be protected, irrespective of whether those instruments are issued by a third-party company or by that institution.</p>

            <p>In that regard, Directive 97/9 is intended, in particular, to protect investors against a situation where an investment firm is unable to meet its obligations to them. In accordance with that objective, Article 1(4) of Directive 97/9 defines the term `investor' broadly as any person who has entrusted money or instruments to such a firm in connection with investment business. Likewise, recital 8 of the directive refers, generally, to `money and instruments held by an investment firm in connection with an investor's investment operations'.</p>

            <p>In accordance with the second recital of Directive 94/19, the deposit-guarantee schemes provided for by that directive have the aim of protecting individuals against deposits in a credit institution becoming unavailable. In providing for such deposit-guarantee schemes, Directive 94/19 is intended, as its first and fourth recitals indicate, both to protect depositors and to ensure the stability of the banking system, by preventing massive withdrawal of deposits not only from a credit institution in difficulties but also from healthy institutions following a loss of public confidence in the soundness of the banking system.</p>

Second, the future transferable securities to which they had subscribed and of which that credit institution was to be the issuer were ultimately not issued before it was declared insolvent. In addition, as regards those transferable securities, whilst the bonds at issue in Case C‑109/16 are among the `debts evidenced by a certificate' envisaged in Article 1(1) of Directive 94/19, the shares at issue in Case C‑688/15, on the other hand, are equity securities, with respect to which that directive provides no guarantee (judgment of 21 December 2016, Vervloet and Others, C‑76/15, EU:C:2016:975, paragraphs 66 and 67).</p>

            <p>That said, it is not in dispute that credit institutions habitually carry out, in connection with that activity, a wide range of operations, a list of which was drawn up by the EU legislature in Annex I to Directive 2006/48. In the light of the fact that Directive 94/19 and Directive 2006/48 both apply to credit institutions and that they pursue common objectives, in particular the protection of savings and depositors, the list of activities set out in that annex is relevant for interpreting the concept of `normal banking transactions' within the meaning of Article 1(1) of Directive 94/19.</p>

            <p>It follows that subscription to future transferable securities on behalf of its customers is among the transactions habitually carried out by credit institutions in the course of their business. Consequently, and in the light of the objectives pursued by Directive 94/19, as noted in paragraph 83 above, such a transaction must be classified as a `normal banking transaction', within the meaning of Article 1(1) of Directive 94/19, when it is carried out by the credit institution, as in the main actions, by using funds of its depositors. Furthermore, and by analogy with the grounds set out in paragraphs 61 to 66 above, the fact that the credit institution is the issuer of the future transferable securities concerned does not affect that classification.</p>

            <p>Second, as regards the question whether the transactions for subscribing to future transferable securities at issue in the main actions resulted in a `temporary situation' within the meaning of Article 1(1) of Directive 94/19, it must be held that where, in the context of such transactions, funds of depositors of a credit institution are debited, before the transferable securities are issued, from their bank accounts and credited to accounts opened in that institution's name, in which they remain deposited until such time as they become the consideration for the acquisition of the transferable securities when the latter are issued, those funds are indeed in such a `temporary situation'.</p>

In the case referred to in Article 1(1) of Directive 94/19 of a `credit balance which results from temporary situations deriving from normal banking transactions', the location of the account in which the credit institution has entered the funds in the course of the normal banking transactions is not decisive.</p>

That exclusion is irrelevant in Case C‑109/16, in relation to which it should be recalled that the bonds had not been issued and not been acquired by Mr Raišelis on the date when Snoras was declared insolvent.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fifth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Directive 97/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 3 March 1997 on investor-compensation schemes, on the one hand, and Directive 94/19/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 1994 on deposit-guarantee schemes, as amended by Directive 2009/14/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2009, on the other, must be interpreted as meaning that claims relating to funds which were debited from accounts that individuals held with a credit institution and credited to accounts opened in that institution's name, in respect of subscription to future transferable securities of which that institution was to be the issuer, in circumstances where owing to that institution's insolvency those securities were ultimately not issued, fall within both the investor-compensation schemes provided for by Directive 97/9 and the deposit-guarantee schemes provided for by Directive 94/19. 2. Article 2(3) of Directive 97/9 must be interpreted as meaning that, in a situation where claims fall within both the deposit-guarantee schemes provided for by Directive 94/19 and the investor-compensation schemes provided for by Directive 97/9, and the national legislature has not directed such claims to a scheme under one or other of those directives, the court dealing with the case may not decide itself, on the basis of that provision, which scheme the holders of those claims may benefit from. On the contrary, in such a situation it falls to the holders of the claims to choose to be compensated by one or other of the schemes laid down in national law to implement those two directives. 3. Article 1(1) of Directive 94/19, as amended by Directive 2009/14, and Article 1(4) and the second subparagraph of Article 2(2) of Directive 97/9, must be interpreted as being capable of being relied upon by individuals before the national courts in support of claims for compensation against a public undertaking entrusted, in a Member State, with the deposit-guarantee and investor-compensation schemes.</p>
