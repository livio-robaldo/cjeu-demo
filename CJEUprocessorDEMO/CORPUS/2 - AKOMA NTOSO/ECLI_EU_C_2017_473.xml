            <p>By that uniform approval procedure, the Member States certify that a vehicle type meets those technical requirements, which, in essence, seek to ensure, as is apparent from Article 4(2) and Article 15(1) of Directive 2003/37, road safety, protection of the environment and safety at work.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, in accordance with the principle of total harmonisation on which Directive 2003/37 is based, Article 7(1), read together with Article 6(1), requires Member States to register new vehicles that are type-approved, that is to say manufactured in conformity with the approved vehicle type, and to permit their sale or their entry into service, where those vehicles are accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity issued by the vehicle manufacturer. It thus follows from those provisions, read in the light of Article 3(4) and Article 4(3) of Directive 2003/37, that new vehicles that have been covered by such EC type-approval in a Member State may be marketed and registered in other Member States without any other formal checking concerning technical requirements.</p>

            <p>The EU type-approval procedure, as provided for by the EU legislature, is thus based on the principle of mutual recognition of the monitoring carried out by the approval authorities of the various Member States of compliance with the requirements set out in Directive 2003/37 and in the separate directives set out in Annex II, Chapter B, thereto (see, to that effect, judgment of 18 November 2010, Lahousse and Lavichy, C‑142/09, EU:C:2010:694, paragraph 27). Its objective is to guarantee and promote the operation of the internal market while safeguarding road safety, the environment and safety at work.</p>

            <p>In that context, it should be observed, in the first place, that the State in which the vehicles are manufactured is irrelevant for the purpose of the application of the EC type-approval procedure. As the Advocate General observed in points 51 to 53 of his Opinion, the obligation imposed on Member States to register new type-approved vehicles only where they are accompanied by a valid certificate of conformity, laid down by Article 7(1) of Directive 2003/37, applies both to vehicles manufactured within the European Union and to those manufactured in a third State and then imported into the European Union.</p>

            <p>In the second place, it should be noted that it is apparent from the wording of Article 7(1) and Article 10(1) of Directive 2003/37 that the requirements that they lay down concerning the registration and the entry into service of vehicles expressly concern only `new vehicles'. Article 23(1)(b) of that directive provides, moreover, that as regards vehicles belonging to categories T1, T2 and T3, Member States are to apply that directive to all `new vehicles' entered into service from 1 July 2009.</p>

            <p>Having regard to its characteristics, the system established by the directive is intended, in respect of vehicles manufactured within the European Union, to apply to new vehicles. All vehicles which, when new, came under Directive 2003/37 and were entered into service within the European Union were consequently covered by EC type-approval.</p>

            <p>However, it must be pointed out, as the Advocate General observed in point 66 of his Opinion, that the system established by Directive 2003/37 has the aim of ensuring that all vehicles, new or used, which belong to specified categories and which are placed on the EU market for the first time, from 1 July 2009 in respect of vehicles in categories T1, T2 and T3, comply with the technical requirements laid down in that directive.</p>

          <content eId="para_10508__content">
            <p>That interpretation is borne out by Regulation No 167/2013 which, unlike Directive 2003/37, specifies in Article 3(37) that `new vehicle' means `a vehicle which has never been previously registered or entered into service'. It is apparent both from Article 2(q) of Directive 2003/37 and from Article 3(40) of Regulation No 167/2013 that `entry into service' must be understood as the first use of a vehicle within the European Union.</p>

            <p>That interpretation is, moreover, confirmed by the view expressed by the Commission in paragraph 72 of the `Guide to application of the Machinery Directive 2006/42/EC' (of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 May 2006 on machinery, and amending Directive 95/16/EC ( OJ 2006 L 157, p. 24)), in which the Commission indicated that `in general, the Machinery Directive does not apply to the placing on the market of used or second-hand machinery', while recognising that there is `one exception to this general rule'. According to the Commission, `the Machinery Directive applies to used or second-hand machinery that was first made available with a view to distribution or use outside the [European Union], when it is subsequently placed on the market or put into service for the first time in the [European Union]'.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, as the Advocate General pointed out, in essence, in points 68 to 69 of his Opinion, a different interpretation that allows each Member State to lay down itself the technical requirements for the entry into service and registration of second-hand vehicles imported from a third country would run counter to the objective of ensuring and promoting the functioning of the internal market pursued successively by Directive 74/150, Directive 2003/37 and now Regulation No 167/2013, since the powers thus conferred on Member States would be liable to impede trade between them.</p>

Directive 2003/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 May 2003 on type-approval of agricultural or forestry tractors, their trailers and interchangeable towed machinery, together with their systems, components and separate technical units and repealing Directive 74/150/EEC, as amended by Commission Directive 2014/44/EU of 18 March 2014, must be interpreted as meaning that the first placing on the market and the registration in a Member State of used or second-hand tractors imported from a third country are subject to compliance with the technical requirements laid down by that directive. 2. Article 23(1)(b) of Directive 2003/37, as amended by Directive 2014/44, must be interpreted as meaning that the provisions of that directive apply to second-hand vehicles coming under categories T1, T2 and T3 and imported into the European Union from a third country, where they are entered into service in the European Union for the first time on or after 1 July 2009.</p>
