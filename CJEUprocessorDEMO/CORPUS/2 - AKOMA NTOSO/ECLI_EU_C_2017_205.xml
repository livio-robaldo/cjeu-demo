As the appellant had been the first company to contact the Commission, in December 2002, pursuant to the 2002 Leniency Notice, and had on that occasion fully cooperated and provided the Commission with all the information in its possession concerning the infringement, it was granted complete immunity from fines.</p>

            <p>In a letter to the appellant dated 28 November 2011, the Commission informed it that it intended to publish a new, more complete, non-confidential version of the PHP Decision ( `the extended version of the PHP Decision'), setting out the entire content of that decision apart from the confidential information.

            <p>Being of the view that that extended version of the PHP Decision contained confidential information or business secrets, the appellant informed the Commission, in a letter of 23 December 2011, that it objected to the proposed publication. In support of that objection, the appellant claimed, more particularly, that that version contained a significant amount of information which it had sent to the Commission under the 2002 Leniency Notice, and also the names of a number of its collaborators and information concerning its business relations. In the appellant's contention, the proposed publication would thus fail to have regard, in particular, to the principles of the protection of legitimate expectations and equal treatment and would be liable to have an adverse effect on the Commission's investigations.</p>

On the other hand, the Commission considered that there was no reason to grant the benefit of confidentiality to the other information for which the appellant had requested such confidential treatment ( `the contested information').</p>

            <p>The hearing officer further noted that the appellant's only reason for objecting to the publication of the new, extended version of the PHP Decision was that it contained information supplied pursuant to the 2002 Leniency Notice and that the disclosure of such information to third parties was likely to be detrimental to it in the context of actions for damages brought before the national courts. In the hearing officer's view, the Commission has a wide discretion to decide to publish more than the essential part of its decisions. In addition, references to documents in the administrative file are not in themselves business secrets or other confidential information.</p>

            <p>The hearing officer took the view that the appellant had not shown that the publication of information which it had communicated to the Commission with a view to benefiting from the leniency programme governed by the 2002 Leniency Notice was likely to cause it serious harm. The interest of an undertaking fined by Commission for an infringement of competition law in the details of the unlawful conduct of which it is accused not being disclosed to the public does not in any event merit special protection. The hearing officer observed, on that point, that actions for damages formed an integral part of EU competition policy and that, accordingly, the appellant could not claim a legitimate interest in being protected against the risk of being subject to such actions as a result of its participation in the cartel to which the PHP Decision related.</p>

            <p>The hearing officer also considered that he was not competent to answer the appellant's argument that disclosure to third parties of the information which it had communicated to the Commission in the context of the leniency programme would harm that programme, as such a question was outside the scope of his terms of reference.

He is also required to check whether that version contains other information which may not be disclosed to the public either on the basis of rules of EU law affording such information specific protection or because it is information of the kind covered by the obligation of professional secrecy.</p>

Those principles did not, therefore, come, in and of themselves, within the protection which EU law confers on information which has come to the knowledge of the Commission in the context of proceedings under Article 101 TFEU.</p>

            <p>However, as pointed out in paragraph 44 above, the aim of Article 8 of Decision 2011/695 is to provide, on a procedural level, for the protection of information required by EU law which has come to the Commission's knowledge in the context of proceedings applying the competition rules.

            <p>As regards, first, the argument by which the appellant complains that the General Court applied to the publication of information communicated for the purposes of obtaining leniency a rule which may not be transposed to that context, it must be pointed out that information which was secret or confidential, but which is at least five years old, must as a rule, on account of the passage of time, be considered historical and therefore as having lost its secret or confidential nature unless, exceptionally, the party relying on that nature shows that, despite its age, that information still constitutes essential elements of its commercial position or that of interested third parties. Those considerations, which give rise to a rebuttable presumption, are valid both in the context of requests for confidential treatment in respect of parties intervening in actions before the EU Courts and in the context of requests for confidentiality with a view to the publication by the Commission of a decision finding an infringement of competition law.</p>

          <content eId="para_3388__content">
            <p>In the present case, after setting out that rule in paragraph 84 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court found, in paragraph 85 of that judgment, that although the contested information all dated from more than five years previously and that most of it even dated from more than 10 years previously, the appellant had put forward no specific argument to show that, in spite of its age, that information still constituted essential elements of its commercial position or that of a third party. The appellant merely asserted that a large number of the passages in the extended version of the PHP Decision, while describing the facts constituting the infringement, contained information relating to the appellant's business relations and its pricing policy.</p>

            <p>Lastly, the General Court concluded, in paragraph 86 of the judgment under appeal, that, even assuming that some of the contested information may have constituted business secrets at a certain time, it had in any event to be considered historical. Moreover, the appellant has not shown how there would still be any reason to confer on it, exceptionally, the protection afforded on that basis by Article 30(2) of Regulation No 1/2003.</p>

            <p>Secondly, it is to be noted that the appellant relies, in the context of the first part of the second ground of appeal, on a contradiction between the assessment, in paragraph 85 of the judgment under appeal, that the information concerned was not confidential on the ground of its historical nature and the assessment, in paragraph 105 of that judgment, that the publication of that information could cause it serious harm.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must, however, be pointed out that that argument is based on a misreading of the judgment under appeal. In paragraph 85 of that judgment, the General Court merely noted the historical nature of the contested information for the purposes of rejecting the appellant's request for the protection of that information as business secrets or confidential business information, whereas the General Court's statement, in paragraph 105 of that judgment, that the disclosure of the contested information would be of such a kind as to cause the appellant serious harm, forms part of the examination of the second of the three conditions governing the protection of the confidentiality of the information communicated, in the present case, to the Commission under the leniency programme.</p>

          <content eId="para_3393__content">
            <p>Thirdly, the appellant's argument that the General Court accepted a general presumption of the loss of confidentiality of the information provided by leniency applicants at the end of five years, the effect of which being to eliminate the protection of the statements made in the context of the leniency programme, is again based on a misreading of the judgment under appeal. As the Advocate General observed in points 136 to 139 of his Opinion, such an argument misconstrues the fact that, in paragraphs 84 to 86 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court simply applied that presumption in order to reject the appellant's assertion that the proposed publication contained sensitive commercial information, and that the application of that presumption was, therefore, without prejudice to the General Court's examination, in paragraphs 88 to 122 of the judgment under appeal, of the appellant's separate complaint relating to the fact that the contested information came from a leniency statement. That argument must, therefore, also be rejected as unfounded.</p>

A general presumption of endangering the aim of the Commission's investigations and the financial interests of the parties to cartel proceedings, such as that established by the Court in the judgment of 27 February 2014, Commission v EnBW ( C‑365/12 P, EU:C:2014:112), should also apply to the publication of passages from the statements of applicants for leniency in the non-confidential versions of the Commission's decisions.</p>

            <p>In the first place, as regards the appellant's argument concerning the rules derived from case-law restricting the conditions in which the Commission may, under Regulation No 1049/2001, disclose to third parties documents in the administrative file relating to a proceeding under Articles 101 TFEU and 102 TFEU, it must be stated, at the outset, that Regulation 1049/2001 does not apply in the context of the present case, which relates to the publication of information in a Commission decision finding an infringement of Article 101 TFEU. The question arises, therefore, of whether, despite the fact that that regulation does not apply to the present case, the case-law formulated on the basis of that regulation, under which the Court acknowledged that there was a general presumption capable of justifying the refusal to disclose the documents in a file relating to a proceeding under Article 101 TFEU, must, nonetheless, be transposed to the publication of decisions on infringements of Article 101 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 27 February 2014, Commission v EnBW, C‑365/12 P, EU:C:2014:112, paragraphs 92 and 93).</p>

That provision reflects considerations concerning the effectiveness of the application of EU competition law in so far as, in particular, such publication enables victims of infringements of Article 101 TFEU to be provided with support during their actions for damages against those who have committed those infringements. Those different interests must, however, be weighed against the protection of rights conferred by EU law, in particular, on the undertakings concerned, such as the right to protection of professional secrecy or business secrecy, or on the individuals concerned, such as the right to the protection of personal data.</p>

The Commission agreed, by letter of 15 March 2012, to delete from the more complete non-confidential version of the PHP Decision, which it proposes publishing, the information that would directly or indirectly enable the source of the information communicated under the 2002 Leniency Notice, and likewise the names of the appellant's collaborators, to be identified.</p>

            <p>By the third part of the second ground of appeal, the appellant submits, in the alternative, that, contrary to the General Court's statements in paragraphs 107 to 111 of the judgment under appeal, the contested information should be protected against the proposed publication, since the conditions laid down in the General Court's judgment of 30 May 2006, Bank Austria Creditanstalt v Commission ( T‑198/03, EU:T:2006:136), are met. Accordingly, the General Court ought to have found that the appellant's interests were worthy of protection.</p>

          <content eId="para_3427__content">
            <p>In the appellant's view, its interest is not in avoiding an order for damages or the disclosure of the Commission's findings on the course of the infringement at issue, but rather dissuading the Commission from eliminating the protection, provided for by the 2002 and 2006 Leniency Notices, afforded to the statements made for the sole purposes of the leniency programme, in the expectation that their confidentiality would be preserved.</p>

          <content eId="para_3428__content">
            <p>In addition, contrary to the General Court's finding in paragraph 149 of the judgment under appeal, the proposed publication would clearly place the appellant at a disadvantage by comparison with other participants in the cartel which have not cooperated with the Commission under the leniency programme. In so far as the relevant passages of the PHP Decision do not constitute the Commission's own findings, but only the verbatim reproduction of the leniency candidates' statements, the disclosure of those passages would have a considerably greater effect on leniency applicants than the cartel participants which have not cooperated with the Commission. The General Court infringed, therefore, in paragraph 164 of the judgment under appeal, the principle of equal treatment.</p>

            <p>It must be noted, first of all, that the appellant does not call into question the consideration set out by the General Court in paragraph 94 of the judgment under appeal, according to which three cumulative conditions must be fulfilled in order for information, such as that at issue, to fall within the protection of professional secrecy and thus to benefit from protection on that ground.</p>

          <content eId="para_3431__content">
            <p>On the other hand, the appellant disputes, in the context of the third part of the present ground of appeal, the application to the present case of the last of those conditions by the General Court and, therefore, the finding, in paragraph 110 of the judgment under appeal, that its interests are not worthy of protection.</p>

        <paragraph eId="para_3432">

          <content eId="para_3432__content">
            <p>In that regard, as has been found in paragraphs 82 and 85 above, the argument developed by the appellant before the General Court in contending that its interest in the non-disclosure of the contested information was worthy of protection was directed at all the information on the ground that the latter had been communicated to the Commission in the context of an application for leniency. That argument was not aimed at any verbatim quotations taken directly from its statement made for the purposes of obtaining such leniency.</p>

        <paragraph eId="para_3433">
          <num>110</num>
          <content eId="para_3433__content">
            <p>In those circumstances, the General Court's assessment in paragraphs 107 to 111 of the judgment under appeal and, in particular, in paragraph 110 thereof, regarding the appellant's having no interest worthy of protection concerning the information it had communicated to the Commission, must necessarily be understood as not concerning such verbatim quotations and as being directed solely at the information, taken from documents produced by the appellant in support of its application for leniency, providing details of the elements constituting the infringement and the appellant's participation in that infringement.</p>

        <paragraph eId="para_3434">
          <num>111</num>
          <content eId="para_3434__content">
            <p>That reading of the General Court's assessment is borne out by paragraph 107 of the judgment under appeal, in which the General Court stated that the interest of an undertaking which has been fined, in the non-disclosure to the public of `the details of the offending conduct of which it is accused' does not warrant any particular protection, and also by paragraph 108 of that judgment, in which the General Court stated that the appellant cannot legitimately object to the publication by the Commission `of information revealing in detail its participation in the infringement penalised in the PHP Decision'.</p>

          <content eId="para_3435__content">
            <p>It follows that the appellant's argument, referred to in paragraph 108 above, is based on a misreading of paragraphs 107 to 111 of the judgment under appeal. That argument must, therefore, be rejected.</p>

            <p>As regards the appellant's argument alleging an infringement of the principle of equal treatment, the examination of that argument would lead the Court of Justice to prejudge the examination -- which must be carried out by the hearing officer -- of the similar argument developed by the appellant during the administrative procedure which the hearing officer incorrectly refrained from adjudicating on, as is apparent from the examination of the first part of the first ground of appeal. In those circumstances, there are no grounds for the Court of Justice to rule on that argument in the context of the present appeal.</p>

            <p>By the fourth part of the second ground of appeal, the appellant submits that the passages taken from the leniency applicants' statements are protected by Article 8 of the ECHR and Article 7 of the Charter and it infers from this that the General Court erred in rejecting, in paragraphs 121 to 126 of the judgment under appeal, its argument alleging an infringement of those provisions. In that regard, the appellant submits that the statements from which the contested information has been taken which the Commission plans to disclose were made under the leniency programme and would not exist without its participation in that programme. The disclosure of such statements, in breach of the 2002 and 2006 Leniency Notices, and the practice established by the Commission, could not, contrary to what the General Court held in paragraphs 125 et seq. of the judgment under appeal, be regarded as a foreseeable consequence of participating in the cartel.</p>

          <content eId="para_3440__content">
            <p>The Court points out that the General Court held, in paragraphs 125 and 126 of the judgment under appeal, that the right to protection of private life guaranteed in Article 8 of the ECHR and Article 7 of the Charter cannot prevent the disclosure of information which, like that whose publication is envisaged in the present case, concerns an undertaking's participation in an infringement of EU law relating to cartels, established in a Commission decision adopted on the basis of Article 23 of Regulation No 1/2003 and intended to be published in accordance with Article 30 of that regulation, since a person cannot, according to the well-established case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, rely on Article 8 of the ECHR in order to complain of a loss of reputation which is the foreseeable consequence of his own actions.</p>

          <content eId="para_3441__content">
            <p>However, although the appellant submits, in the context of the present appeal, that the disclosure of the contested information could not be considered a foreseeable consequence of its participation in the cartel at issue, it adduces no evidence capable of supporting such an assertion. As the Commission has argued, while the contested information is of direct relevance to the elements constituting the infringement and the appellant's participation in it, the appellant had to expect, in a case such as the present, that that information might be the subject of a public decision, unless such information is protected on another ground.</p>
