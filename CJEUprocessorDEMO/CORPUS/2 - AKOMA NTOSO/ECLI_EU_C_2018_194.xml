            <p>In that regard, the Commission specified that ÖS, a company governed by private law, provided, by the printing of those documents, a supply of services which should have been awarded in accordance with Directive 92/50 or Directive 2004/18, to the extent that the supply falls within the scope of one of those directives, or in conformity with the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services as enshrined in Articles 49 and 56 TFEU, to the extent that it does not fall within the scope of those directives.</p>

In essence, that Member State again relied on national security interests and emphasised that the performance of the printing contracts in question was closely linked to public order and the institutional operation of that State. It argued in particular that the observance of security requirements could be enforced against undertakings other than ÖS only by means of civil law, whereas, by law, the Austrian public authorities enjoyed special supervisory powers in relation to ÖS.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the Commission states that ÖS is a limited liability company governed by private law, the sole shareholder of which is Österreichische Staatsdruckerei Holding AG whose shares are listed on the stock market and held by private individuals. Moreover, unlike the earlier legislative provisions, the StDrG no longer contains any special mechanism for State supervision. At the hearing, the Commission explained in that regard that the Austrian authorities are vested with supervisory powers which are stipulated in a contract entered into with ÖS.</p>

            <p>The Commission argues that, in so far as the value of the contract for producing fireworks display permits does not exceed the thresholds laid down by those directives, it must nonetheless be entered into in conformity with the principles laid down by the FEU Treaty, in particular the principles of freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services.</p>

            <p>The Commission explains that, even if the value of a contract for the production of fireworks display permits seems relatively low, such a contract could, taking account of its technical characteristics, attract interest from undertakings in other Member States. There is therefore certain cross-border interest since the market of undertakings which produce secure identity documents is specialised, limited and internationalised and geographic proximity does not constitute a requirement for the performance of a contract for the production of secure documents.</p>

            <p>It is agreed between the parties that the estimated value of the contract for the production of fireworks display permits is EUR 56000, namely, an amount which is well below the thresholds laid down by Directives 92/50 and 2004/18 for public service contracts. Accordingly, there was no obligation flowing from those directives to conduct a procurement procedure.</p>

            <p>Nonetheless, according to settled case-law, the award of contracts which, in view of their value, do not fall within the scope of the directives on the award of public contracts is subject to the fundamental rules and general principles of the FEU Treaty, in particular the principles of equal treatment and of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality and the consequent obligation of transparency, provided that those contracts have certain cross-border interest (judgment of 6 October 2016, Tecnoedi Costruzioni, C‑318/15, EU:C:2016:747, paragraph 19 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be noted that it is for the Commission to establish that the contract in question has certain interest for an undertaking located in a Member State other than that of the contracting authority in question, and the Commission is unable to rely on any presumption for that purpose (see, to that effect, judgment of 13 November 2007, Commission v Ireland, C‑507/03, EU:C:2007:676, paragraphs 32 and 33 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>With regard to the objective criteria which may indicate certain cross-border interest, the Court has previously held that such criteria may be, inter alia, the fact that the contract in question is for a significant amount, in conjunction with the place where the work is to be carried out or the technical characteristics of the contract and the specific characteristics of the products concerned (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 October 2016, Tecnoedi Costruzioni, C‑318/15, EU:C:2016:747, paragraph 20 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Whilst, as the Commission argued, the existence of such cross-border interest cannot be determined solely on the basis of the value of the contract, an overall assessment of other criteria and of all the relevant circumstances of the case being necessary, it should be noted that the contract for the production of fireworks display permits is distinguished not only by its relatively low value but also by its very technical nature, furthermore requiring compliance with special security measures with the costs that the implementation of such measures entails.</p>

            <p>The argument put forward by the Commission, that the fact that ÖS has been entrusted by a number of foreign States with the printing of visas and passports is a strong indication of the existence of certain cross-border interest, is irrelevant with regard to the printing of fireworks display permits.</p>
