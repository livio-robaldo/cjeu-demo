            <p>Among the actions to benefit from that support was the acquisition of a spinach processing line, used to turn freshly harvested spinach into frozen spinach. That processing line, acquired by ETG, was installed on the site of Ardo Austria Frost GmbH ( `Ardo'), an ETG co-contractor, which is active in the processing and marketing of ETG products. That line was to be operated `under the supervision and responsibility' of ETG and, according to the latter, the land necessary for that processing line had been `made available to ETG by Ardo pursuant to a loan agreement for the installation and operation of machinery [constituting the processing line]'.</p>

            <p>By letter of 19 January 2010, the competent Austrian authority approved that operational programme. The Bundesverwaltungsgericht (Federal Administrative Court, Austria) states, in that regard, that it is common ground that, when the competent Austrian authority considered that investment as being eligible for the aid at issue, that authority knew that that processing line was not on land owned by ETG, but on the Ardo site. That court also states that that operational programme was based on a calculation of the value of marketed production made using turnover for 2009, since ETG was only established in 2009, and that that value has been calculated by including in particular the `processing costs', including, for the spinach concerned, `reduction into pieces, washing, cutting, drying, blanching ...

It submits that the refusal of the aid relating to the processing line was effective against ETG on the ground that `that investment was a measure implemented on land belonging to a third party'. If point 23 were to be interpreted as meaning that it precludes absolutely aid for investments made on land belonging to a third party, that is to say without the applicant being able to prove on a case-by-case basis that there are legitimate economic reasons to invest in equipment located on land owned by a third party, point 23 of Annex IX could, according to the referring court, be invalid.</p>

In that regard, the referring court states that it questions how it should itself respond to ETG's arguments on the principle of legal certainty, in order to challenge the repayment sought, or even to obtain the payment of sums forming the subject matter of binding commitments, in the event that the Court does not in any way limit the temporal effects of its ruling, or makes a limitation that does not extend to ETG.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should first of all be pointed out that AMA's decision of 12 October 2015, relating to the payment of the balance of the EU's financial aid for 2014, in the context of an operational programme for the years 2010 to 2014, that programme having been approved on 19 January 2010, namely before the adoption of Regulation No 543/2011, is disputed before the referring court. However, in the absence of any transitional provision to the contrary and considering that Article 149 of Implementing Regulation No 543/2011 repeals Regulation No 1580/2007 and states that the references made to it are to be construed as being references to Implementing Regulation No 543/2011, it must be held that the question of the validity of the actions carried out and the expenditure made in respect of the payment of that aid for the year 2014 is in fact governed by the provisions of Implementing Regulation No 543/2011.</p>

            <p>Second, the objectives pursued by Implementing Regulation No 543/2011 also establish that only producer organisations recognised in accordance with EU law may benefit from EU financial aid. In that regard, it should be recalled, in addition to recital 42 of that regulation, the substance of which is set out in the preceding paragraph of the present judgment, that that regulation lays down detailed rules for the application of Regulation No 1234/2007 as regards the sectors of fruit and vegetables as well as processed fruit and vegetables. It follows from Article 103b of that regulation that the financing of operational funds of producer organisations in the fruit and vegetables sector, to which EU financial aid may contribute, may be used only to finance operational programmes approved by Member States in accordance with Article 103g of that regulation.</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is apparent from the order for reference that, although the processing line at issue in the case in the main proceedings was purchased by ETG and is used `under the supervision and responsibility' of the latter, that processing line is set up on land owned by Ardo, which was `made available to ETG by [Ardo] under a loan agreement for the installation and operation of machinery [constituting the processing line]'. The investment concerned therefore does not appear to have been carried out on a holding and/or premises which, in law and in fact, are under the exclusive control of ETG, so that any use of it for the benefit of a third party is excluded. The application of the non-eligibility criterion for the aid laid down in point 23 of Annex IX to Implementing Regulation No 543/2011 therefore appears to be justified.</p>

The same is true of the financial allocation of that investment to that producer organisation and to the existence of an alleged `economic attachment' of that investment to the producer organisation's operations or even to the fact that there would be an `operational link' between that investment and that organisation.

As has been stated in paragraph 59 of the present judgment, the criterion of non-eligibility for the aid laid down in point 23 of Annex IX to Implementing Regulation No 543/2011 appears to be applicable to that investment, even if it is on a ground different from that envisaged by the referring court.

            <p>As a preliminary point, it should be stated that that question is based on the premiss that the Court has not temporally limited the effects of the present judgment. ETG has, in essence, requested such a limitation in the event that the Court should find one of the provisions of EU law at issue in the case in the main proceedings to be invalid. In the present judgment, however, the Court has confined itself to interpreting certain provisions of EU law.</p>

As is clear from paragraphs 59 and 61 of the present judgment, the investments at issue in the case in the main proceedings do not appear eligible for aid if they are made on holdings and/or premises which are not under the exclusive control of the producer organisation concerned. It is therefore appropriate to rule on that request.</p>

            <p>In support of that request, the Austrian Government submits that there is a risk of serious economic repercussions for the applicant company in the main proceedings, which could disappear, as well as for the whole fruit and vegetables sector. In addition, the Austrian Government maintains that point 23 of Annex IX to Implementing Regulation No 543/2011 refers, in many language versions, to the existence of an operational link between the producer organisation and the investment concerned, thus creating an objective and significant uncertainty as to the scope of EU law.</p>

            <p>It is settled case-law that the interpretation which, in the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred on it by Article 267 TFEU, the Court gives to a provision of EU law clarifies and defines the meaning and scope of that provision as it must be or ought to have been understood and applied from the time of its entry into force. It follows that the provision as thus interpreted may, and must, be applied by the courts even to legal relationships which arose and were established before the judgment ruling on the request for interpretation, provided that in other respects the conditions for bringing a dispute relating to the application of that rule before the courts having jurisdiction are satisfied (judgments of 15 March 2005, Bidar, C‑209/03, EU:C:2005:169, paragraph 66 and the case-law cited, and of 22 September 2016, Microsoft Mobile Sales International and Others, C‑110/15, EU:C:2016:717, paragraph 59 and the case-law cited).</p>

Two essential criteria must be fulfilled before such a limitation can be imposed, namely, that those concerned must have acted in good faith and there must be a risk of serious difficulties (judgments of 15 March 2005, Bidar, C‑209/03, EU:C:2005:169, paragraph 67 and the case-law cited, and of 22 September 2016, Microsoft Mobile Sales International and Others, C‑110/15, EU:C:2016:717, paragraph 60 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>More specifically, the Court has taken that step only in quite specific circumstances, notably where there was a risk of serious economic repercussions owing in particular to the large number of legal relationships entered into in good faith on the basis of rules considered to be validly in force and where it appeared that individuals and national authorities had been led to adopt practices which did not comply with EU law by reason of objective, significant uncertainty regarding the implications of EU provisions, to which the conduct of other Member States or the European Commission may even have contributed (judgments of 15 March 2005, Bidar, C‑209/03, EU:C:2005:169, paragraph 69 and the case-law cited, and of 22 September 2016, Microsoft Mobile Sales International and Others, C‑110/15, EU:C:2016:717, paragraph 61 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the present case, in its application for the temporal limitation of the effects of the present judgment, also presented if the Court should declare the invalidity of one or more provisions referred to by the national court, the Austrian Government in no way explains how the interpretation adopted in paragraph 61 of the present judgment is, on its own, likely to entail a risk of serious economic repercussions. In that respect, the Austrian Government merely refers, in a general way, to the fact that the absence of a temporal limitation of the effects of the present judgment `could lead to potentially fatal consequences' and relies on `a high number of legal relationships', without providing any data on the number of producer organisations that may be concerned or any amounts involved.</p>

The exercise of any discretion to decide whether or not it would be expedient to demand repayment of EU funds unduly or irregularly granted would be inconsistent with that duty (see, by analogy, judgment of 16 July 1998, Oelmühle and Schmidt Söhne, C‑298/96, EU:C:1998:372, paragraph 23 and the case-law cited), as has already been noted in paragraph 68 of the present judgment.</p>

                <num>--</num>
                <p>the mere fact that an investment made in the context of an operational programme covered by Article 60(1) of that regulation is located on land which is owned by a third party, and not the producer organisation concerned, is not, in principle, under point 23 of Annex IX, a ground for non-eligibility of aid for the expenditure incurred, by that producer organisation, in respect of that investment;</p>
              </item>
              <item>
                <num>--</num>
                <p>point 23 of Annex IX relates to investments made on holdings and/or premises which are, in law and in fact, under the exclusive control of that producer organisation, so that any use of those investments for the benefit of a third party be excluded. 2. The principle of the protection of legitimate expectations must be interpreted as not precluding, in circumstances such as those at issue in the case in the main proceedings, the competent national authority, first, refusing payment of the amount of the financial aid which had been requested by a producer organisation for an investment finally considered to be ineligible for that aid pursuant to point 23 of Annex IX to Implementing Regulation No 543/2011 and, second, requesting the producer organisation to reimburse the aid already received for that investment. 3. In circumstances such as those at issue in the case in the main proceedings, EU law must be interpreted as meaning that, in the absence of a temporal limitation of the effects of the present judgment, it does not preclude the principle of legal certainty being taken into account in order to exclude the recovery of aid unduly paid, provided that the conditions laid down be the same as for the recovery of purely national financial payments, that the interests of the European Union be taken fully into account and that the good faith of the beneficiary of the aid be established.</p>
