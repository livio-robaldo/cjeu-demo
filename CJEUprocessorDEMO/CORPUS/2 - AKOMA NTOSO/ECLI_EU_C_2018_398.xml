            <p>On 25 July 2008, Mr Tarragó da Silveira, residing in London (United Kingdom), brought before the Tribunal de Comarca de Lisboa (District Court of Lisbon, Portugal) a debt recovery action, based on a contract for the provision of services, against Espírito Santo Financial Group, with its seat in Luxembourg.</p>

            <p>Mr Tarragó da Silveira brought an appeal against that judgment before the Supremo Tribunal de Justiça (Supreme Court). In support of his appeal, he submits that Article 15 of Regulation No 1346/2000 only applies to lawsuits pending concerning a specific asset or right and that lawsuits concerning an obligation of a monetary nature do not fall within the scope of that regulation. Accordingly, in this case, the effects of the insolvency proceedings opened in Luxembourg on the ongoing proceedings before the Portuguese courts should be governed, in accordance with the general rule on conflict of laws under Article 4 of that regulation, by the law of the Member State where those proceedings were initiated, in this case the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. In contrast to Portuguese law, Luxembourgish law does not provide for the termination of lawsuits pending.</p>

            <p>The referring court is asking whether, as Mr Tarragó da Silveira submits, the expression `an asset or a right of which the debtor has been divested' limits the scope of application of Article 15 of Regulation No 1346/2000 to only lawsuits pending concerning a specific asset or right. In other words, it asks whether that article applies only to lawsuits pending concerning a specific right held by the debtor or to a specific asset that he holds. It states that this is not the case in a lawsuit concerning the payment of a sum of money on the basis of a contractual obligation.</p>

            <p>According to the Court's settled case-law, the wording used in one language version of a provision of EU law cannot serve as the sole basis for the interpretation of that provision or be given priority over the other language versions. Provisions of EU law must be interpreted and applied uniformly in the light of the versions existing in all EU languages (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 July 2016, JZ, C‑294/16 PPU, EU:C:2016:610, paragraph 38 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In that respect, it should be noted that the various language versions of that provision are not unambiguous. The respective versions in English, French and Italian, in particular, use the expressions `an asset or a right of which the debtor has been divested', ` un bien ou un droit dont le débiteur est dessaisi' and ` un bene o a un diritto del quale il debitore è spossessato'. However, the versions in Spanish, Czech, Danish and German, in particular, use the expressions ` un bien o un derecho de la masa', ` majetku nebo práva náležejícího do majetkové podstaty', ` et aktiv eller en rettighed i massen' and ` einen Gegenstand oder ein Recht der Masse'.</p>

            <p>Although the wording of that article is not without ambiguity, the context and the objectives of the article require an interpretation to the effect that its scope of application cannot be limited to ongoing proceedings concerning a specific asset or right of which the debtor has been divested.</p>

That provision does not in any way indicate that a lawsuit pending, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, must concern a specific asset or right. The use of the general expression `lawsuit pending' confirms, on the contrary, that Article 15 of Regulation No 1346/2000 applies to lawsuits pending concerning not only a specific right or asset, but, more broadly, an asset or right that is part of the insolvency estate.</p>

            <p>It should be noted that assets or rights `of which the debtor has been divested' within the meaning of Article 15 of Regulation No 1346/2000, are those of which he has been divested due to the opening of insolvency proceedings. In accordance with Article 16(1) of that regulation, any judgment opening insolvency proceedings is to be recognised in all the other Member States from the time that it becomes effective in the State of the opening of proceedings. Therefore the concept of `assets or rights of which the debtor has been divested' refers not only to the specific assets or rights of the debtor but rather covers the debtor's insolvency estate as a result of the opening of insolvency proceedings.</p>

            <p>Second, as regards the objectives of Regulation No 1346/2000, it must be noted that it would be contrary to the objective pursued by that regulation, as emerges from recital 8, namely to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of insolvency proceedings having cross-border effects, to oblige the court hearing the case, in relation to judicial proceedings concerning a monetary obligation, to apply in the course of proceedings a foreign law with the sole aim of determining the effects that the opening of insolvency proceedings in another Member State would have on that case. That would risk delaying the judgment of that court relating to the determination and fixing the amount of any debt and, if applicable, would prevent the creditor from registering in due time his claim in the insolvency estate in those insolvency proceedings.</p>

            <p>Thus, in accordance with the objective mentioned in the preceding paragraph, the interpretation of Article 15 of Regulation No 1346/2000 in paragraph 23 of this judgment enables the court, when hearing a lawsuit pending, to determine the effects of the opening of the insolvency proceedings on that lawsuit in accordance with its national law.</p>

            <p>It follows from the foregoing that the scope of Article 15 of Regulation No 1346/2000 cannot be limited to only ongoing proceedings concerning a specific asset or right of which the debtor has been divested.</p>

            <p>As the Court has already stated, it would be contradictory to interpret Article 15 of Regulation No 1346/2000 as also covering enforcement proceedings, with the consequence that the effects of the opening of insolvency proceedings would thus come within the scope of the law of the Member State in which such enforcement proceedings are pending, while, in parallel, Article 20(1) of that regulation, by explicitly requiring the return to the liquidator of everything obtained `through enforcement', would render Article 15 ineffective (judgment of 9 November 2016, ENEFI, C‑212/15, EU:C:2016:841, paragraph 34).</p>

          <content eId="para_13179__content">
            <p>Furthermore, Regulation No 1346/2000 is guided by the principle that the requirement of equal treatment of creditors, which, mutatis mutandis, underpins all insolvency proceedings, precludes, in general, proceedings brought by individual creditors by means of enforcement proceedings, introduced and conducted while insolvency proceedings against the debtor are pending (judgment of 9 November 2016, ENEFI, C‑212/15, EU:C:2016:841, paragraph 33).</p>

          <content eId="para_13180__content">
            <p>Consequently, it must be held that enforcement proceedings do not fall within the scope of application of Article 15 of Regulation No 1346/2000 (judgment of 9 November 2016, ENEFI, C‑212/15, EU:C:2016:841, paragraph 35).</p>

          <content eId="para_13181__content">
            <p>However, actions for a declaration of monetary obligations which merely determine the rights and obligations of the debtor, without involving their realisation, and which therefore, unlike individual enforcement proceedings, do not risk undermining the principle of equal treatment of creditors and the collective resolution of insolvency proceedings, fall within the scope of application of Article 15.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, it is for the referring court to determine, before any application of Article 15 of Regulation No 1346/2000, whether Mr Tarragó da Silveira's action is an action on the merits of the case specifically claiming payment of a debt and whether, as such, it is distinguishable from the proceedings for enforced recovery of that debt.</p>

On those grounds, the Court (Ninth Chamber) hereby rules: Article 15 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1346/2000 of 29 May 2000 on insolvency proceedings must be interpreted as applying to a lawsuit pending before a court of a Member State seeking an order that a debtor pay a sum of money due under a contract for the provision of services and pay monetary damages for failure to comply with that contractual obligation, in the event that (i) the debtor was declared insolvent in insolvency proceedings opened in another Member State; and (ii) the declaration of insolvency applies to all of the debtor's assets.</p>
