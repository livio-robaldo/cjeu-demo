            <p>The referring arbitration tribunal takes the view that the resolution of the dispute in the main proceedings depends on the interpretation of the third subparagraph of Article 21(5) of Directive 2003/96. The first sentence of that provision states that an entity producing electricity for its own use is regarded as a distributor. However, in its Portuguese language version, the second sentence of that provision states that `these small producers' may be exempted. Therefore, it must be determined whether only small electricity producers must be regarded as distributors.</p>

            <p>By its questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the third subparagraph of Article 21(5) of Directive 2003/96 must be interpreted as meaning that any entity, including the entity in question in the main proceedings, which produces electricity for its own use, regardless of its size and irrespective of its main economic activity, must be regarded as a distributor whose electricity is subject to taxation in accordance with the first subparagraph of Article 21(5) of that directive.</p>

            <p>It should be observed as a preliminary point that, according to settled case-law, in the procedure laid down by Article 267 TFEU, providing for cooperation between national courts and the Court of Justice, it is for the latter to provide the national court with an answer which will be of use to it and enable it to determine the case before it. To that end, the Court may have to reformulate the questions referred to it (judgment of 21 December 2011, Evroetil, C‑503/10, EU:C:2011:872, paragraph 48 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>The fact that a national court has, formally speaking, worded its request for a preliminary ruling by referring to certain provisions of EU law does not preclude the Court of Justice from providing to the national court all the elements of interpretation which may be of assistance in adjudicating on the case pending before it, whether or not that court has referred to them in its questions. It is for the Court to extract from all the information provided by the national court, in particular from the grounds of the order for reference, the points of EU law which require interpretation, having regard to the subject matter of the dispute (judgment of 29 September 2016, Essent Belgium, C‑492/14, EU:C:2016:732, paragraph 43 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In that regard, as is apparent from the order for reference, Turbogás disputes the legality of the tax imposed, in the form of the tax on petroleum products and energy, on the portion of the electricity produced whose consumption is an inherent part of the electricity production process. Therefore, as the European Commission suggested in its written observations and as the Advocate General noted in points 13 and 27 of his Opinion, the possible exemption of such consumption under Article 14(1)(a) of Directive 2003/96, which exempts from taxation energy products and electricity used to produce electricity, must also be examined.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, it is necessary to reformulate the questions referred as seeking, in essence, to ascertain whether the third subparagraph of Article 21(5) and Article 14(1)(a) of that directive must be interpreted as meaning that an entity such as the one in question in the main proceedings, which produces electricity for its own use, regardless of its size and irrespective of its economic activity, must be regarded as a `distributor', within the meaning of the first of those provisions, whose consumption of electricity for the purpose of electricity production, however, comes under the mandatory exemption provided for in Article 14(1)(a).</p>

            <p>In the first place, it should be observed that, on the one hand, the first sentence of the third subparagraph of Article 21(5) of Directive 2003/96 classifies as a `distributor' an entity producing electricity for its own use. The Portuguese language version of the second sentence of the third subparagraph of Article 21(5) of that directive provides, on the other hand, that Member States may exempt `estes pequenos produtores', an expression which may be translated as `these small producers'. However, other language versions of Directive 2003/96, such as the German, English or French language versions, do not refer to ` these small producers' but simply to `small producers'.</p>

            <p>As noted by the referring court, it follows that a link between the two sentences which form the third subparagraph of Article 21(5) of Directive 2003/96 could be inferred from that Portuguese language version, which would imply that the entities producing electricity for their own use, as referred to in the first sentence of the third subparagraph of Article 21(5) of that directive, should be understood as being only `small producers'. Therefore, an entity such as the one in question in the main proceedings could not be regarded as a distributor of electricity. However, that interpretation is not apparent from all the language versions of the directive.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be borne in mind that it is settled case-law that the wording used in one language version of a provision of EU law cannot serve as the sole basis for the interpretation of that provision, or be made to override the other language versions in that regard. Provisions of EU law must be interpreted and applied uniformly in the light of the versions established in all the languages of the European Union. Where there is a divergence between the various language versions of an EU legislative text, the provision in question must be interpreted by reference to the general scheme and the purpose of the rules of which it forms part (judgment of 20 December 2017, Gusa, C‑442/16, EU:C:2017:1004, paragraph 34 and the case-law cited).</p>

Any other interpretation would undermine the objectives pursued by that directive, as referred to in paragraphs 34 and 35 of this judgment. First, the electricity thus produced would necessarily be subject to double taxation. Secondly, it could lead to unequal treatment between entities such as the one in question in the main proceedings and other electricity producers using energy products and electricity supplied by third parties for the purpose of their own production, which would be a source of distortions of competition (see, to that effect, judgment of 7 March 2018, Cristal Union, C‑31/17, EU:C:2018:168, paragraph 33).</p>

The fact remains that the Member States, when exercising their power to lay down the conditions to which the exemptions provided for in Article 14(1) of the directive are subject, must observe the general principles of law which form part of the legal order of the European Union, including, inter alia, the principle of proportionality (judgment of 2 June 2016, Polihim-SS, C‑355/14, EU:C:2016:403, paragraphs 57 and 59).</p>
