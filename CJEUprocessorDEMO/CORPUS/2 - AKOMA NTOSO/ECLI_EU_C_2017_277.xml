            <p>By a decision of 14 November 2013, varied on 29 May 2014, the Celní úřad pro Jihočeský kraj (South Bohemian Region Customs Office, Czech Republic) ordered the confiscation of a number of products belonging to Eko-Tabak, on the ground that these constituted smoking tobacco within the meaning of Article 101(6) of the Law on excise duties and, accordingly, were subject to excise duty. It is apparent from information supplied by the referring court that those products are dried, flat, irregular, partly stripped leaf tobacco and/or parts thereof which have undergone primary drying and controlled dampening, which contain glycerine allowing the dampness and elasticity of the leaves to be maintained so that they will not break when handled, and which, while not intended for smoking, are capable of being smoked after simple processing, for example, by means of crushing or hand-cutting. Those products were, in their entirety, intended for sale to the final consumer.</p>

            <p>Eko-Tabak brought an action against that decision before the Krajský soud v Českých Budějovicích (Regional Court of České Budějovice, Czech Republic), arguing that the definition of the products falling within the scope of the last clause of Article 101(6) of the Law on excise duties unlawfully broadened the list of manufactured tobacco products set out in Directive 2011/64.</p>

          <content eId="para_5475__content">
            <p>By decision of 30 January 2015, that court dismissed Eko-Tabak's action, finding that the definition laid down in the final clause of Article 101(6) of the Law on excise duties did not go beyond the scope of Directive 2011/64, in so far as the spirit and purpose of that directive was to make liable to duty products which, without being intended for smoking, were nonetheless capable of being smoked, and also to avoid the circumvention of tax legislation or EU law.</p>

            <p>Eko-Tabak brought an appeal against that judgment before the Nejvyšší správní soud (Supreme Administrative Court, Czech Republic). The company argued, inter alia, that Directive 2011/64 contained no category of manufactured tobacco corresponding to that laid down in the final clause of Article 101(6) of the Law on excise duties and that the condition that the product concerned can be smoked must be fulfilled from the moment that that product is placed in a shop for the purpose of sale. Moreover, the fact that a tobacco product can be smoked is not sufficient for it to be considered to be manufactured tobacco within the meaning of the directive. The condition that the product concerned can be smoked is only one of the conditions that must be fulfilled by a tobacco product in order for that product to be classified as `smoking tobacco', within the meaning of the directive.</p>

            <p>Although it is apparent from the decision to refer that Article 101 of the Law on excise duties serves to transpose Articles 2 and 5 of Directive 2011/64 into the Czech legal order, the Nejvyšší správní soud (Supreme Administrative Court) has doubts as to whether products such as those at issue in the main proceedings constitute manufactured tobacco to which that directive applies. If the answer to that question is in the negative, the referring court seeks to establish whether Articles 2 and 5 of the directive preclude a Member State from imposing duty on such products.</p>

            <p>The referring court considers, moreover, that manufactured tobacco, within the meaning of Directive 2011/64, is characterised principally by the fact that it can be smoked. That characteristic would also enable different groups or types of manufactured tobacco to be defined.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be noted that, as follows from Article 1, the purpose of Directive 2011/64 is to lay down general principles for the harmonisation of the structure and rates of the excise duty to which the Member States subject manufactured tobacco. That directive falls, therefore, within the European Union's fiscal legislation on tobacco products, which, in the words of recital 2 of that directive, has the objective of ensuring the proper functioning of the internal market and, at the same time, a high level of health protection.</p>

In particular, it is stated, in essence, in recital 8 of that directive, that products which are similar in many respects to products covered by that directive are to be treated in the same way, while recital 9 of the directive states that harmonisation of excise duty structures must result in competition in the different categories of manufactured tobacco belonging to the same group not being distorted by the effects of the charging of the tax and, consequently, in the opening of the national markets of the Member States.</p>

            <p>As regards smoking tobacco in particular, it is apparent from the wording of Article 2(1)(c)(i) and (ii) of that directive that that category is divided into two subcategories headed `fine-cut tobacco for the rolling of cigarettes' and `other smoking tobacco', respectively.</p>

            <p>For its part, Article 5(1) and (2) of Directive 2011/64 sets out the definitions of `smoking tobacco' and `fine-cut tobacco for the rolling of cigarettes', respectively. Accordingly, the first of those definitions encompasses both `tobacco which has been cut or otherwise split, twisted or pressed into blocks and is capable of being smoked without further industrial processing' and `tobacco refuse put up for retail sale which does not fall under [the definition of cigarettes or that of cigars and cigarillos] and which can be smoked'.</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is not disputed that the tobacco products at issue in the main proceedings fall neither within the definition of `fine-cut tobacco for the rolling of cigarettes', within the meaning of Article 2(1)(c)(i) and of Article 5(2) of Directive 2011/64, nor that of `tobacco refuse', within the meaning of Article 5(1)(b) of that directive.</p>

            <p>Therefore, in order to determine whether those products fall within the subcategory `other smoking tobacco', under Article 2(1)(c)(ii) of Directive 2011/64, it is necessary to examine whether they constitute `smoking tobacco', in the light of the definition in Article 5(1)(a) of that directive.</p>

            <p>It is apparent from the wording of Article 5(1)(a) of Directive 2011/64 that it requires that two cumulative conditions are met, namely, first, that the tobacco be cut or otherwise split, twisted or pressed into blocks and, secondly, that it is capable of being smoked without further industrial processing.</p>

            <p>In that regard, there being no definition of the words `cut' and `split' in that directive, it is necessary, in order to determine the scope of those words, to refer to their usual and everyday accepted meanings (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 July 2015, Sommer Antriebs- und Funktechnik, C‑369/14, EU:C:2015:491, paragraph 46 and the case-law cited). Those words, the usual meaning of which is very wide, refer, inter alia, as regards the first, to the result of the process of removing a part or a piece of something with a sharp instrument, and, as regards the second, to the result of the process of breaking up or dividing something.</p>

            <p>It follows from the case-law of the Court of Justice, in essence, that simple handling intended to make an unfinished tobacco product capable of being smoked, such as merely inserting a roll of tobacco into a cigarette tube, is not `industrial processing' (see, by analogy, judgments of 24 September 1998, Brinkmann, C‑319/96, EU:C:1998:429, paragraphs 18 and 20, and of 10 November 2005, Commission v Germany, C‑197/04, EU:C:2005:672, paragraphs 31 and 32).</p>

Subject to verification by the referring court, it therefore appears that those products also satisfy the second condition referred to in paragraph 25 of the present judgment and, therefore, fall within the definition of `smoking tobacco' laid down in Article 5(1)(a) of Directive 2011/64.</p>

Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Sixth Chamber) hereby rules: Article 2(1)(c) and Article 5(1) of Council Directive 2011/64/EU of 21 June 2011 on the structure and rates of excise duty applied to manufactured tobacco must be interpreted as meaning that dried, flat, irregular, partly stripped leaf tobacco and/or parts thereof which have undergone primary drying and controlled dampening, which contain glycerine and which are capable of being smoked after simple processing by means of crushing or hand-cutting, fall within the definition of `smoking tobacco' for the purpose of those provisions.</p>
