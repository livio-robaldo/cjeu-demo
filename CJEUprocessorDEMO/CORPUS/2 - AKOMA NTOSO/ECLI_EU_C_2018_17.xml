            <p>By letter of 7 July 2015, Ferroser Servicios Auxiliares informed Mr Ruiz Conejero of his dismissal under Article 52(d) of the Workers' Statute on the ground that the cumulative duration of his absences, albeit justified, had exceeded the limits laid down in that provision, namely, 20% of working time during March and April 2015, and that during the previous 12 months he had been absent for 5% of working time.</p>

            <p>The referring court states that it seeks guidance on the interpretation of Directive 2000/78 on account of the interpretation of that directive given by the Court in the judgment of 11 April 2013, HK Danmark ( C‑335/11 and C‑337/11, EU:C:2013:222). It notes that, in the case which gave rise to that judgment, the Danish legislation formed part of a policy for the integration of workers with disabilities and its aim was to encourage employers to hire employees with a particular risk of having to take sick leave repeatedly. That was not the situation in the case in the main proceedings, in which there was no legislative objective of integration of workers with disabilities. The referring court therefore considers that Article 52(d) of the Workers' Statute is contrary to Directive 2000/78 and that this provision should, therefore, be amended in order to take account of disabilities.</p>

            <p>It should be noted that unfavourable treatment on grounds of disability does not run counter to the protection provided for by Directive 2000/78 unless it constitutes discrimination within the meaning of Article 2(1) of that directive. A worker with a disability covered by that directive must be protected against all discrimination in relation to a worker not so covered. The question thus arises whether the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings is liable to produce discrimination against persons with disabilities (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 April 2013, HK Danmark, C‑335/11 and C‑337/11, EU:C:2013:222, paragraph 71).</p>

            <p>In that regard, Article 52(d) of the Workers' Statute applies in the same way to persons with disabilities as to persons without disabilities who have been absent from work. In those circumstances, it cannot be held that that provision establishes a difference of treatment directly based on disability, within the meaning of the combined provisions of Article 1 and Article 2(2)(a) of Directive 2000/78, since it uses a criterion that is not inseparably linked to disability (see, to that effect, judgments of 11 April 2013, HK Danmark, C‑335/11 and C‑337/11, EU:C:2013:222, paragraphs 72 and 74, and of 9 March 2017, Milkova, C‑406/15, EU:C:2017:198, paragraph 42).</p>

            <p>On the question whether Article 52(d) of the Workers' Statute is liable to entail a difference of treatment indirectly based on disability, it must be observed that taking account of days of absence because of illness linked to disability in the calculation of days of absence because of illness amounts to assimilating illness linked with disability to the general concept of illness. However, as stated by the Court in paragraph 44 of the judgment of 11 July 2006, Chacón Navas ( C‑13/05, EU:C:2006:456), the concepts of `disability' and `sickness' cannot simply be treated as being the same (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 April 2013, HK Danmark, C‑335/11 and C‑337/11, EU:C:2013:222, paragraph 75).</p>

            <p>It should be noted in that respect that a worker with a disability is, in principle, more exposed to the risk of being dismissed under Article 52(d) of the Workers' Statute than a worker without a disability. Compared with such a worker, a worker with a disability has the additional risk of being absent by reason of an illness connected with his disability. He thus runs a greater risk of accumulating days of absence because of illness, and consequently of reaching the limits laid down in Article 52(d) of the Workers' Statute. It is thus apparent that the rule in that provision is liable to place disabled workers at a disadvantage and so to bring about a difference of treatment indirectly based on disability within the meaning of Article 2(2)(b) of Directive 2000/78 (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 April 2013, HK Danmark, C‑335/11 and C‑337/11, EU:C:2013:222, paragraph 76).</p>

That is why certain absences, such as those due to the illnesses described in the preceding paragraph of the present judgment, may not form the basis of a decision to dismiss on the ground of intermittent absences from work. During 2012, the Spanish legislature added absences for medical treatment for cancer or serious illness to the list of absences that may not constitute a ground for dismissal. Workers with disabilities generally fall within some of these cases, so that, in those cases, absences attributable to disability are not taken into account for the purposes of dismissal on the ground of intermittent absences from work.</p>

            <p>As the Spanish Government has observed, among the factors to be taken into account in the assessment referred to in paragraph 49 of the present judgment is the existence, in the Spanish legal system, of provisions aimed at specifically protecting persons with disabilities, including Article 40 of legislative Decree 1/2013, cited in paragraph 11 of the present judgment. Such provisions are capable of preventing or compensating for the disadvantages caused by a disability, including the possibility of suffering an illnesses linked to the disability.</p>

            <p>In the light of those factors, it is for the referring court to assess, with respect to persons with disabilities, whether the measures provided for in Article 52(d) of the Workers' Statute go beyond what is necessary to attain the aim pursued.</p>

            <p>Having regard to all the foregoing, the answer to the question referred is that Article 2(2)(b)(i) of Directive 2000/78 must be interpreted as precluding national legislation under which an employer may dismiss a worker on the grounds of his intermittent absences from work, even if justified, in a situation where those absences are the consequence of sickness attributable to a disability suffered by that worker, unless that legislation, while pursuing the legitimate aim of combating absenteeism, does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that aim, which is a matter for the referring court to assess.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules: Article 2(2)(b)(i) of Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation must be interpreted as precluding national legislation under which an employer may dismiss a worker on the grounds of his intermittent absences from work, even if justified, in a situation where those absences are the consequence of sickness attributable to a disability suffered by that worker, unless that legislation, while pursuing the legitimate aim of combating absenteeism, does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve that aim, which is a matter for the referring court to assess.</p>
