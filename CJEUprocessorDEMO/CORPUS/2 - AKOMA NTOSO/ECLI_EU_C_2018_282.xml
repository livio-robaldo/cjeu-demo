On the contrary, that system of mutual assistance, as it is based, in particular, on the principle of mutual trust, increases legal certainty with regard to the determination of the Member State in which disputes are settled and thus makes it possible to avoid forum shopping (see, by analogy, judgment of 21 November 2011, N.S. and Others, C‑411/10 and C‑493/10, EU:C:2011:865, paragraph 79).</p>

            <p>In this regard, it is important to point out that, in accordance with Article 13(1) of Directive 2010/24, the claim in respect of which a request for recovery has been made is to be treated as if it were a claim of the requested Member State, that latter Member State being thus required to make use of the powers and procedures provided for under the laws, regulations or administrative provisions applying to claims concerning identical or similar taxes or duties in its legal system. It is difficult to imagine that an instrument permitting enforcement of an identical or similar claim of the requested Member State would be enforced by that State if that enforcement were liable to be contrary to its own public policy (see, by analogy, with regard to Directive 76/308, judgment of 14 January 2010, Kyrian, C‑233/08, EU:C:2010:11, paragraph 43).</p>

            <p>In order to assess whether circumstances such as those referred to by the national court may, without disregarding the principle of mutual trust, lead to a refusal to enforce, it is necessary to note, first of all, that the function of the uniform instrument, addressed by the applicant authority to the requested authority for the purposes of the recovery of a claim and sent by the requested authority to the person concerned attached to a request for payment, is not to notify the person concerned of the decision, adopted in the Member State of the applicant authority, on which that claim is based. That instrument, which, as was noted in paragraph 9 above, refers to, inter alia, the type and quantum of the claim and the personal data of the person concerned, is intended to allow the authorities of the requested Member State to adopt enforcement measures and thus to assist in the recovery. By contrast, the communication of that instrument, without the decision imposing the fine and the reasoning for that decision being sent to the person concerned, does not constitute a notification of that decision.</p>

            <p>Next, it should be noted that the system of mutual assistance for the recovery of claims seeks, inter alia, to ensure the effective notification of all instruments and decisions which emanate from the Member State in which the applicant authority is situated and which relate to a claim or to its recovery (see, with regard to Directive 76/308, judgment of 14 January 2010, Kyrian, C‑233/08, EU:C:2010:11, paragraph 57). Article 8 of Directive 2010/24 provides, in that regard, for the possibility for the authority which issued the claim to seek assistance, from the competent authority in the Member State of residence of the person concerned, with the notification of the documents relating to that claim.</p>

            <p>Lastly, it should be noted that, in order to be able to exercise his right to an effective legal remedy, within the meaning of Article 47 of the Charter, against a decision adversely affecting his interests, the person concerned must know the reasons upon which the decision taken in relation to him is based, either by reading the decision itself or by requesting and obtaining notification of those reasons, in order that he may defend his rights in the best possible conditions and decide, with full knowledge of the relevant facts, whether there is any point in his applying to the court with jurisdiction (judgment of 4 June 2013, ZZ, C‑300/11, EU:C:2013:363, paragraph 53 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In circumstances such as those established by the referring court in the case in the main proceedings, the person concerned is subject to the enforcement procedure relating to the request for recovery covered by Directive 2010/24, notwithstanding the fact that the fine in question was not notified to him. The person concerned is thus placed in a situation in which payment of the amount of that fine, together with the interest and costs referred to in Article 2(2)(c) of that directive and interest for late payment referred to in Article 13(3) thereof, is claimed from him by the requested authority even though, due to a lack of sufficient knowledge of the content of and the reasoning for the decision imposing the fine on him, he was not in a position to contest that decision in the Member State of the applicant authority.</p>

            <p>As the Advocate General noted, in essence, in point 70 of his Opinion, a situation in which the applicant authority seeks recovery of a claim based on a decision which was not notified to the person concerned does not satisfy the condition governing requests for recovery, laid down in Article 11(1) of Directive 2010/24. Since, according to that provision, a request for recovery within the meaning of that directive cannot be made as long as the claim and/or the instrument permitting enforcement of its recovery in the Member State of transmission is contested in that Member State, it follows that such a request also cannot be made when the person concerned has not been informed of the very existence of that claim, that information being a necessary prerequisite for the ability to contest that claim.</p>

            <p>Moreover, this interpretation is supported by Article 47 of the Charter and by the case-law of the Court concerning the service and notification of judicial documents. It follows in particular from that case-law that, in order to ensure respect for the rights laid down in Article 47 of the Charter, it is important not only to ensure that the addressee of a document actually receives the document in question but also that he is able to know and understand effectively and completely the meaning and scope of the action brought against him abroad, so as to be able effectively to assert his rights in the Member State of transmission (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 September 2015, Alpha Bank Cyprus, C‑519/13, EU:C:2015:603, paragraphs 31 and 32 and the case-law cited). Such considerations are also relevant in the context of Directive 2010/24.</p>

            <p>Consequently, in the case where a request for recovery is presented, even though the person concerned has not had the opportunity to raise the matter before the courts of the applicant Member State under conditions compatible with the fundamental right to an effective remedy, the rule laid down in Article 14(1) of Directive 210/24, as transposed into national law, cannot reasonably be invoked against that person.</p>

            <p>That is a fortiori so where, as in the present case, the applicant authority itself indicated, in the request for recovery, and therefore at a point in time earlier than that at which the person concerned became aware of the existence of the claim in question, that it was no longer possible to bring administrative or judicial proceedings in the applicant Member State with a view to contesting that claim. Although, admittedly, the Greek Government subsequently, in its observations before the Court, asserted the contrary, submitting that the possibility to bring proceedings was not extinguished following the expiry of the period for bringing an action triggered by the publication of that claim in the Official Journal of the Hellenic Republic, the person concerned cannot be criticised for having taken into consideration the information provided by the applicant authority in the request for recovery, information of which the person concerned, after becoming aware of the existence of that claim, had received a copy and which he had caused to be checked by an expert in Greek law, who confirmed it.</p>

            <p>It follows from the foregoing that an exceptional situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings in the present case, in which an authority of a Member State requests an authority of another Member State to recover a claim relating to a fine of which the person concerned was unaware, may legitimately lead to a refusal of assistance with the recovery by that latter authority. The assistance provided for in Directive 2010/24 is, as is indicated by the title and various recitals of that directive, described as `mutual', which implies, in particular, that it is for the applicant authority to create, before it makes a request for recovery, the conditions under which the requested authority will be able to grant its assistance in a meaningful manner and in conformity with the fundamental principles of EU law.</p>

            <p>In the light of all of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the question referred is that Article 14(1) and (2) of Directive 2010/24, read in the light of Article 47 of the Charter, must be interpreted as not precluding an authority of a Member State from refusing to enforce a request for recovery concerning a claim relating to a fine imposed in another Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, on the ground that the decision imposing that fine was not properly notified to the person concerned before the request for recovery was made to that authority pursuant to that directive.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules: Article 14(1) and (2) of Council Directive 2010/24/EU of 16 March 2010 concerning mutual assistance for the recovery of claims relating to taxes, duties and other measures, read in the light of Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, must be interpreted as not precluding an authority of a Member State from refusing to enforce a request for recovery concerning a claim relating to a fine imposed in another Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, on the ground that the decision imposing that fine was not properly notified to the person concerned before the request for recovery was made to that authority pursuant to that directive.</p>
