            <p>The first ground of appeal is directed against paragraphs 28 to 53 of the judgment under appeal, in which the General Court held that neither Council Directive 98/24/EC of 7 April 1998 on the protection of the health and safety of workers from the risks related to chemical agents at work (fourteenth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) ( OJ 1998 L 131, p. 11) nor Directive 2004/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the protection of workers from the risks related to exposure to carcinogens or mutagens at work (sixth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Council Directive 89/391/EEC) ( OJ 2004 L 158, p. 50) constitutes `specific Community legislation imposing minimum requirements' within the meaning of Article 58(2) of the REACH Regulation. VECCO and Others claim that the General Court misinterpreted that provision.</p>

            <p>The appellants claim that, in paragraphs 40 to 44 and 50 to 53 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court erred in law by restricting the scope of the exemption laid down in Article 58(2) of the REACH Regulation solely to secondary legislation which relates to particular substances explicitly named.</p>

            <p>According to VECCO and Others, the exemption set out in Article 58(2) of the REACH Regulation does not apply to substances per se, but rather to their uses or categories of uses. Accordingly, it is not necessary for the legislation in question to specifically name the relevant substances. In that regard, VECCO and Others note that ECHA has acknowledged, in a document entitled `Preparation of draft Annex XIV entries for the third recommendation of substances to be included in Annex XIV -- General Approach' that uses falling within the exemption include, inter alia, the hazard classification category of a substance (as a carcinogen, mutagen or reproductive toxicant). Contrary to what was held by the General Court in paragraph 41 of the judgment under appeal, the appellants claim that that interpretation would not be liable seriously to jeopardise the purpose and functioning of the REACH Regulation.</p>

            <p>VECCO and Others maintain that the purpose of Article 58(2) of the REACH Regulation requires a preliminary consideration as to whether existing EU legislation is sufficient to ensure the risks are properly controlled. The three criteria laid down in that provision, requiring `specific Community legislation' imposing `minimum requirements' to ensure `the risk is properly controlled', should therefore be assessed together, in the light of that objective, rather than being assessed in isolation, as done by the General Court.</p>

            <p>According to VECCO and Others, on a proper construction of Article 58(2) of the REACH Regulation, the General Court should have, first, examined whether Directives 98/24 and 2004/37 were `specific' to the use of chromium trioxide in the surface treatment and electropolishing industry, secondly, if that had been found to be the case, have determined whether that existing legislation imposed `minimum requirements' and, thirdly, have verified whether those minimum requirements were sufficient to properly control the risks involved.</p>

            <p>As regards the first criterion under Article 58(2) of the REACH Regulation, relating to the existence of `specific' EU legislation, VECCO and Others consider it satisfied, given that the uses or categories of uses for which an exemption has been requested, namely, surface coating and electropolishing processes using chromium trioxide, fall within the uses contemplated by Directive 98/24 and, on account of that substance being classified as a carcinogen, by Directive 2004/37.</p>

            <p>As regards the second criterion of Article 58(2) of the REACH Regulation, VECCO and Others consider that the General Court appropriately outlined, in paragraphs 37 and 43 of the judgment under appeal, the `minimum requirements' laid down by Directives 98/24 and 2004/37. However, they maintain that that court failed to assess in concreto whether those requirements ensured proper control of the risk to workers in the surface treatment and electropolishing industry.</p>

            <p>The appellants claim that the General Court was wrong to find, in paragraph 40 of the judgment under appeal, that Directive 98/24 lays down only a general framework of the duties imposed on employers who expose their employees to chemical risks. They assert that the General Court also held, in paragraph 44 of the judgment under appeal, that since Directive 98/24 does not lay down a maximum occupational exposure limit for the substance at issue, that directive cannot be considered to impose `minimum requirements', within the meaning of Article 58(2) of the REACH Regulation.</p>

            <p>VECCO and Others maintain that the setting of maximum occupational exposure limits is neither the best nor the only method of managing chemical risks. The lack of such maximum limits for chromium trioxide is not sufficient for it to be concluded that those directives do not impose `minimum requirements', within the meaning of Article 58(2) of the REACH Regulation.</p>

            <p>As regards the criterion concerning the proper control of risks, VECCO and Others take issue with paragraph 64 of the judgment under appeal, by which the General Court held that it was impossible to assess whether that criterion had been satisfied, because of the lack of specific Community legislation imposing minimum requirements. The appellants claim that that `superficial' interpretation misconstrued, in law, the overall objective of Article 58(2) of the REACH Regulation and failed to have regard, in fact, to the evidence adduced as a whole, which sought to demonstrate that the risk to workers in the surface treatment and electropolishing industry stemming from the use of chromium trioxide is properly controlled by existing EU legislation.</p>

            <p>The Commission disputes the interpretation proposed by VECCO and Others to the effect that Article 58(2) of the REACH Regulation applies to uses and not to substances. It agrees with the reasoning of the General Court in finding that it was not necessary to examine the uses covered by Directives 98/24 and 2004/37, since those directives are not specific to chromium trioxide.</p>

To that end, that regulation introduces an integrated system for monitoring chemical substances, including registration, evaluation and authorisation, together with possible restrictions on their use (see, inter alia, judgment of 15 March 2017, Polynt v ECHA, C‑323/15 P, EU:C:2017:207, paragraph 20).</p>

            <p>As made clear, inter alia, in recitals 69 and 70 of the REACH Regulation, that regulation makes substances `of very high concern' subject to careful attention. Those substances are thus subject to the authorisation scheme laid down in Title VII of that regulation. Article 55 of that regulation states that the objective of the authorisation scheme is `to ensure the good functioning of the internal market while assuring that the risks from substances of very high concern are properly controlled and that these substances are progressively replaced by suitable alternative substances or technologies where these are economically and technically viable' (see, inter alia, judgment of 15 March 2017, Polynt v ECHA, C‑323/15 P, EU:C:2017:207, paragraph 21).</p>

            <p>The first stage under that authorisation scheme is the procedure for identifying substances of very high concern on the basis of the criteria set out in Article 57 of the REACH Regulation. The second stage is the inclusion of those substances on the list of substances subject to authorisation set out in Annex XIV to that regulation, and the third and final stage concerns the procedure that leads, if appropriate, to the authorisation of a substance of very high concern (see, inter alia, judgment of 15 March 2017, Polynt v ECHA, C‑323/15 P, EU:C:2017:207, paragraph 22).</p>

            <p>In order to ensure coherence between the authorisation scheme laid down in Title VII of the REACH Regulation and other EU legal provisions aimed at protecting human health and the environment from risks arising from the use of chemical substances, Article 58(2) of that regulation allows for the exemption of certain uses or categories of uses from the authorisation requirement `provided that, on the basis of the existing specific Community legislation imposing minimum requirements relating to the protection of human health or the environment for the use of the substance, the risk is properly controlled'.</p>

            <p>It is clear from that provision that certain uses or categories of uses of a substance of very high concern may be exempted from the authorisation requirement if two conditions are satisfied. Those conditions require, first, that there be `existing specific Community legislation imposing minimum requirements relating to the protection of human health or the environment for the use of the substance' and, secondly, that, on the basis of that legislation, `the risk [be] properly controlled'. It is also apparent from the clear wording of that provision that those conditions are cumulative, which means that, as the General Court essentially held in paragraphs 32 and 64 of the judgment under appeal, it is sufficient that only one of those conditions is not satisfied for the exemption to have to be refused.</p>

            <p>In accordance with settled case-law, the meaning and scope of the term `specific legislation', for which the REACH Regulation provides no definition, must be determined by considering its usual meaning in everyday language, while also taking into account the context in which it occurs and the purposes of the rules of which it is part (see, by analogy, judgment of 24 June 2015, Hotel Sava Rogaška, C‑207/14, EU:C:2015:414, paragraph 25 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In everyday language, the usual meaning of the adjective `specific' denotes that which is distinctive of a particular subset and distinguishes it from other subsets, thus it can be regarded as the opposite of `general'. In accordance with its usual meaning, the term `specific legislation' used in Article 58(2) of the REACH Regulation must be interpreted as referring, at the very least, to any directive or regulation laying down rules particular to the substance concerned. That term is to be understood as contrasting with legislation governing either a group of substances or categories of uses, which are defined generally and abstractly.</p>

            <p>VECCO and Others nonetheless maintain that the exemption laid down in Article 58(2) of the REACH Regulation applies to uses or categories of uses and not to substances. Consequently, they claim that in order to determine whether that exemption is applicable, rather than assessing whether the substance in question is expressly mentioned in the legislation at issue, it is necessary to assess whether that legislation makes it possible, in practice, properly to control the risks associated with the uses or categories of uses considered for that substance. Thus the appellants submit that the General Court erred in law by holding that Directives 98/24 and 2004/37 do not constitute specific legislation imposing minimum requirements on the ground that those directives do not expressly mention chromium trioxide.</p>

            <p>In that regard, although the first sentence of Article 58(2) of the REACH Regulation refers not to the notion of `substance' but only to the notion of `uses or categories of uses', the fact remains that the exemption mechanism implies an inextricable link between a substance and its uses or categories of uses.</p>

            <p>The objective of the REACH Regulation is to regulate substances, as is apparent from its title and its general scheme.

            <p>As is apparent from Article 55 of that regulation, those substances may be placed on the market only on the basis of an authorisation which ensures that the risks posed by their use are properly controlled.

            <p>Furthermore, the decision to include a substance in Annex XIV of the REACH Regulation must, in accordance with Article 58(1)(e) of that regulation, state in particular the uses or categories of uses exempted from the authorisation requirement, if any, and the conditions for such exemptions, if any.</p>

            <p>Moreover, as the General Court correctly stated, in essence, in paragraphs 41 and 44 of the judgment under appeal, the interpretation of Article 58(2) of the REACH Regulation put forward by VECCO and Others would mean, in particular, that any substance in carcinogenicity category 1 or 2 would be exempted from the obligation to obtain authorisation for occupational uses, on the ground that Directive 2004/37 governs such use for all carcinogenic substances. Such an interpretation is incompatible with both the wording and purpose of the authorisation scheme under Title VII of the REACH Regulation with regard to substances of very high concern, such as substances in carcinogenicity category 1 or 2.</p>

Consequently, the General Court was fully entitled to conclude, at paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, that the first of the two conditions laid down by that provision was not satisfied and, accordingly, that Court was justified in rejecting, in paragraph 66 of the judgment under appeal, the plea alleging infringement of Article 58(2) of the REACH Regulation.</p>
