            <p>In their application, Marina del Mediterráneo and Others claimed, in essence, that the participation of the second temporary consortium in the procurement procedure infringed both national legislation and EU legislation, since, first, Marbella City Council is a public authority which does not have the status of an undertaking within the meaning of national legislation and which cannot be considered an economic operator without distorting the rules of free competition and equality of tenderers, and, secondly, that temporary consortium does not fulfil the requirements of economic and financial solvency in so far as the financial risks it takes are covered by the budget of that City Council.</p>

            <p>By decision of 3 May 2011, the executive director of the Agency dismissed the application. In that decision, he referred to the case-law of the Court and, in particular, the judgment of 23 December 2009, CoNISMa ( C‑305/08, EU:C:2009:807), which confers the status of tenderer to any public entity or group consisting of such entities offering services on the market, even if only occasionally. In addition, the executive director took the view that the financial solvency of the second temporary consortium had been established on account of Marbella City Council's revenue budget.</p>

            <p>As is apparent from the documents before the Court, the public contract at issue in the main proceedings was awarded, by decision of 6 June 2011, to the second temporary consortium.

            <p>By letter of 5 July 2011, Marina del Mediterráneo and Others lodged a contentious administrative appeal with the Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Andalucía (High Court of Justice of Andalusia, Spain) against the decision of 3 May 2011 of the executive director of the Agency. In the appeal, that temporary consortium, on the basis of the same arguments it put forward before the Agency in the context of the special application in procurement proceedings, seeks annulment of that decision and, accordingly, annulment of the measures that followed it, particularly the decision of 6 June 2011 awarding the contract at issue to the second temporary consortium.</p>

            <p>By decision of 19 February 2015, the national court hearing the case informed the parties to the main proceedings that there might be grounds for inadmissibility of the contentious administrative appeal on the basis of national legislation which defines the acts that may be the subject of a special application in procurement proceedings. In accordance with that legislation, preparatory acts which decide, directly or indirectly, the award of the contract, make it impossible to continue the procedure or to put up a defence, or cause irreparable harm to legitimate rights or interests, may be the subject of an action in procurement proceedings.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, the decision of a procurement board which does not exclude a tenderer but which, on the contrary, admits the tender and allows the tenderer to participate in the procurement procedure that has been initiated does not constitute a decision-making act which is open to review; that does not, however, prevent the person concerned from reporting any irregularities noted and using them subsequently when challenging the act awarding the contract at issue, which is indeed a decision-making act.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, in relation to the doubts expressed by the Spanish Government concerning the admissibility of the request for a preliminary ruling in the present case, it must be borne in mind that, in accordance with the first and second subparagraphs of Article 1(1) of Directive 89/665, read in the light of recital 2 of Directive 2007/66, Directive 89/665 applies, in a context such as that in the main proceedings, only to contracts falling within the scope of Directive 2004/18, unless, however, such contracts are excluded in accordance with Articles 10 to 18 of that directive. The following considerations are therefore based on the premiss that Directive 2004/18 is applicable to the contract at issue in the main proceedings and, therefore, that Directive 89/665 is also applicable to the procedure in the main proceedings, which it is for the referring court to ascertain.</p>

            <p>It should be noted that the wording of Article 1(1) of Directive 89/665 assumes, by using the words `as regards ... procedures', that every decision of a contracting authority falling under EU rules in the field of public procurement and liable to infringe them is subject to the judicial review provided for in Article 2(1)(a) and (b) of that directive. That provision thus refers generally to the decisions of a contracting authority without distinguishing between those decisions according to their content or time of adoption (see judgment of 11 January 2005, Stadt Halle and RPL Lochau, C‑26/03, EU:C:2005:5, paragraph 28 and the case-law cited).</p>

Moreover, a restrictive interpretation of that concept would be incompatible with the terms of Article 2(1)(a) of that directive which requires Member States to make provision for interim relief procedures in relation to any decision taken by the contracting authorities (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 January 2005, Stadt Halle and RPL Lochau, C‑26/03, EU:C:2005:5, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>That interpretation of the concept of `decisions taken by the contracting authorities' which are amenable to review is not called into question by the fact that the Court held, in paragraph 35 of the judgment of 11 January 2005, Stadt Halle and RPL Lochau ( C‑26/03, EU:C:2005:5), that acts which form part of the internal reflections of the contracting authority with a view to a public award procedure are not amenable to review. As regards the decision at issue in the main proceedings to admit the tender submitted by a tenderer, it must be held that such a decision, by its very nature, falls outside the internal reflections of the contracting authority.

            <p>As regards the time from which review procedures must be available, it is appropriate to recall that, as is apparent from its first and second recitals, Directive 89/665 is intended to strengthen the existing mechanisms, both at national and EU levels, to ensure the effective application of the directives relating to public procurement, in particular at a stage when infringements can still be corrected. To that effect, the third subparagraph of Article 1(1) of that directive requires Member States `to ensure that ... decisions taken by the contracting authorities may be reviewed effectively and, in particular, as rapidly as possible' (see judgment of 12 December 2002, Universale-Bau and Others, C‑470/99, EU:C:2002:746, paragraph 74).</p>

            <p>As the Court has already held, although Directive 89/665 has not formally laid down the time from which the possibility of review, as provided for in Article 1(1), must be open, the objective of that directive, as referred to in the preceding paragraph, does not authorise Member States to make the exercise of the right to apply for review conditional on the fact that the public procurement procedure in question has formally reached a particular stage (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 January 2005, Stadt Halle and RPL Lochau ( C‑26/03, EU:C:2005:5, paragraph 38).</p>

            <p>It is settled case-law that, in the absence of EU rules laying down the time from which a possibility of review must be open, it is for national law to lay down the detailed rules of judicial procedures governing actions for safeguarding rights which individuals derive from EU law. Those detailed procedural rules must, however, be no less favourable than those governing similar domestic actions (principle of equivalence) and must not render practically impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by EU law (principle of effectiveness) (judgments of 30 September 2010, Strabag and Others, C‑314/09, EU:C:2010:567, paragraph 34; 6 October 2015, Orizzonte Salute, C‑61/14, EU:C:2015:655, paragraph 46; and 26 November 2015, MedEval, C‑166/14, EU:C:2015:779, paragraphs 32, 35 and 37).</p>

            <p>In particular, the detailed procedural rules governing the remedies intended to protect rights conferred by EU law on candidates and tenderers harmed by decisions of contracting authorities must not compromise the effectiveness of Directive 89/665 (see, to that effect, judgments of 3 March 2005, Fabricom, C‑21/03 and C‑34/03, EU:C:2005:127, paragraph 42; 6 October 2015, Orizzonte Salute, C‑61/14, EU:C:2015:655, paragraph 47; and 15 September 2016, Star Storage and Others, C‑439/14 and C‑488/14, EU:C:2016:688, paragraph 43).</p>

            <p>As regards, more specifically, a decision such as that at issue in the main proceedings allowing a tenderer to participate in a public procurement procedure, the fact that the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings requires, in all cases, a tenderer to wait for a decision awarding the contract in question before it may apply for a review of a decision allowing another tenderer to participate in that procurement procedure infringes the provisions of Directive 89/665.</p>

            <p>That interpretation is not called into question by the finding that full implementation of the objective sought by Directive 89/665 would be undermined if candidates and tenderers were allowed to invoke, at any stage of the award procedure, infringements of the rules of public procurement, thus obliging the contracting authority to restart the entire procedure in order to correct such infringements (judgment of 12 March 2015, eVigilo, C‑538/13, EU:C:2015:166, paragraph 51 and the case-law cited). That finding concerns the justification of reasonable time limits for applying for review of decisions which may be challenged and not the barring of an independent review of a decision allowing a tenderer to participate in a public procurement procedure, such as follows from the legislation at issue in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, it is for the referring court to determine whether the other conditions relating to the availability of review procedures, as provided for in Directive 89/665, are satisfied. In that regard, it should be noted that, in accordance with the third subparagraph of Article 1(1) and Article 1(3) of that directive, in order for the review of decisions taken by a contracting authority to be regarded as effective, review procedures must be available at least to any person having or having had an interest in obtaining a particular contract and who has been or risks being harmed by an alleged infringement of EU public procurement law or rules transposing that law (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 April 2016, PFE, C‑689/13, EU:C:2016:199, paragraph 23). It is therefore, more specifically, for the national court to determine, in the context of the main proceedings, whether Marina del Mediterráneo and Others have or have had an interest in obtaining the contract in question and have been or risk being harmed by the decision of the Agency to admit the tender of the second temporary consortium.</p>
