            <p>First, he takes the view that the French Republic's argument relating to the inconsistency between the definition of the concept of `investigation' used in the judgment under appeal and the approach taken in judgment of 25 September 2014, Spirlea v Commission ( T‑306/12, EU:T:2014:816) concerning EU Pilot procedures is inadmissible, in so far as the argument constitutes a new plea which should have been raised before the General Court. According to Mr Schlyter, EU Pilot procedures had already been in use since 2008 and, therefore, the argument based on a comparison of the different procedures could have been introduced before the General Court.</p>

            <p>Lastly, Mr Schlyter asserts that the argument that disclosure of the detailed opinion at issue would undermine the quality of dialogue between the Commission and the Member State concerned because it was likely to affect negotiations and create public pressure is inadmissible in the context of an appeal, since Mr Schlyter has already sought proof from the French Republic that such an undermining effect existed before the General Court. However, according to Mr Schlyter, that Member State did not provide the proof sought but merely cited Advocate General Kokott's Opinion in the case Commission v Technische Glaswerke Ilmenau ( C‑139/07 P, EU:C:2009:520), without explaining how this was relevant to the present case. As it is, all evidence in support of that argument should have been presented before the General Court.</p>

            <p>In respect of those objections of inadmissibility, it should be noted, first, that according to paragraph 52 of the judgment under appeal, the French Republic claimed before the General Court that the procedure laid down by Directive 98/34 must be classified as an `investigation' and that the delivery of a detailed opinion by the Commission in the context of that procedure is part of an investigation for the purposes of the third indent of Article 4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001. In the present appeal, that Member State seeks to demonstrate, by invoking the alleged inconsistency between the judgment under appeal and the judgment of 25 September 2014, Spirlea v Commission ( T‑306/12, EU:T:2014:816), that the General Court committed an error of law by not categorising the procedure laid down by Directive 98/34 as an `investigation' within the meaning of the third indent of Article 4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001. Such an argument does not constitute a new plea but supplements a plea already set out before the General Court.</p>

            <p>Second, it is clear that the French Republic's argument that the Commission frequently needs to gather facts in order to assess whether a draft technical regulation is compatible with internal market rules does not criticise a statement of fact made by the General Court regarding a specific procedure carried out by the Commission; rather, it concerns the categorisation of the procedure established by Directive 98/34 as an `investigation' within the meaning of the third indent of Article 4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001, and thus constitutes a question of law.</p>

            <p>Third, it must be noted that, according to paragraph 40 of the judgment under appeal, in the decision at issue, the Commission gave reason for the application of the third indent of Article 4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001 to the present case by taking the view that public disclosure of the detailed opinion concerned during the standstill period would hamper the French Republic's willingness to cooperate with it in a spirit of mutual trust. Moreover, it is clear from the statement in intervention submitted by the French Republic at first instance that it claimed before the General Court, in essence, that the Commission took an inquisitorial approach to the bilateral dialogue, provided for by Directive 98/34, which is subject to a requirement of confidentiality in order to facilitate an amicable resolution of the dispute between the institution and the Member State concerned, without public pressure. It is in that context, by implicitly invoking an analogy between the present case and that giving rise to the judgment of 29 June 2010, Commission v Technische Glaswerke Ilmenau ( C‑139/07 P, EU:C:2010:376), that the French Republic referred to Advocate General Kokott's Opinion in the latter case, with a view to supporting its argument that a certain degree of confidentiality has to be preserved in order to not disrupt the negotiations between the Commission and the Member State concerned. As it is, the amplification of an argument developed before the General Court is admissible on appeal.</p>

The requirement of confidentiality in the procedure laid down by Directive 98/34, which also prevails in the pre-litigation phase of the infringement proceedings, is intended to protect the quality of dialogue in order to reach an amicable resolution.</p>

It takes the view that the argument raised in paragraph 87 of the judgment under appeal is misconceived and that those negotiations must be protected from any external pressure, for the Commission is trying to convince the Member State concerned that its draft national legislation could be incompatible with EU law and, often, suggests alternative solutions. If that institution had to wait for the formal introduction of infringement proceedings before the dialogue could enjoy confidential treatment, that would undermine the use of preventative control and there could be a negative impact on the internal market. Moreover, the Commission alleges that such a situation would harden the position of the parties and would make the prospect of a favourable resolution in respect of EU law more remote.</p>

            <p>According to the Court's well-established case-law, in order to justify refusal of access to a document the disclosure of which has been requested, it is not sufficient, in principle, for that document to be covered by an activity mentioned in Article 4(2) and (3) of Regulation No 1049/2001. The institution concerned must also provide explanations as to how access to that document could specifically and actually undermine the interest protected by an exception laid down in that article (judgment of 27 February 2014, Commission v EnBW, C‑365/12 P, EU:C:2014:112, paragraph 64 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the present case, as is clear from paragraphs 14 and 40 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission justified the application of the third indent of Article 4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001 to the present case by stating that public disclosure of the detailed opinion concerned during the standstill period would diminish the French Republic's willingness to cooperate with it in a spirit of mutual trust. Such publication would, therefore, undermine the protection of the purpose of investigations under the third indent of Article 4(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001.</p>

            <p>First, contrary to the French Republic's contention, by considering in paragraphs 84 to 88 of the judgment under appeal that, should the procedure laid down by Directive 98/34 constitute an investigation, the disclosure of the detailed opinion at issue would not necessarily undermine the purpose of that procedure, the General Court responded to an argument that had been put forward for its assessment.</p>

            <p>Indeed, as the Advocate General noted in point 132 of his Opinion, it is clear from paragraph 76 of the judgment under appeal that the French Republic claimed before the General Court that the destabilising aspect of informing the public of the Commission's potential criticisms with regard to a notified draft technical regulation before the Member State has had the opportunity to respond to them should not be underestimated.</p>

            <p>With this argument, the French Republic intended to support the Commission's position cited in paragraph 77 of the judgment under appeal and referred to in paragraph 3 of the decision at issue, that disclosure of the detailed opinion in question during the standstill period could adversely affect subsequent discussions between the parties.</p>

            <p>Second, the argument put forward by the French Republic in the context of the present appeal, that disclosing the detailed opinion would necessarily harm the quality of dialogue between the Commission and the Member State concerned so that it would no longer be possible to reach an amicable resolution cannot be accepted either.</p>

            <p>As the General Court noted in paragraph 85 of the judgment under appeal, the purpose of the procedure laid down by Directive 98/34 and, in particular, the detailed opinion delivered by the Commission in the context of that procedure is to prevent the adoption, by a national legislature, of a technical regulation that constitutes an obstacle to the free movement of goods or services or the freedom of establishment of service operators within the internal market.</p>

            <p>As regards that objective of Directive 98/34, the General Court recalled, in paragraphs 37 and 85 of the judgment under appeal, the settled case-law of the Court of Justice according to which that directive protects, by means of preventive monitoring, the free movement of goods and services and the freedom of establishment of service operators, which form part of the foundations of the European Union, and that this control serves a useful purpose in that technical regulations falling within the scope of that directive may constitute obstacles to trade in goods between Member States, such obstacles being permissible only if they are necessary to satisfy compelling requirements relating to the public interest (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 July 2014, Ivansson and Others, C‑307/13, EU:C:2014:2058, paragraph 41 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It must be noted that the system established by Directive 98/34 seeks to allow, as recital 7 of that directive indicates, economic operators to make more of the advantages inherent in the internal market by ensuring the regular publication of the titles of the technical regulations proposed by Member States and thus enabling those operators to give their assessment of the impact of those regulations.</p>

            <p>The Commission itself pointed out in paragraph 5 of the decision at issue that economic operators as well as civil organisations are likely to play an active role and contribute to the functioning of the system established by Directive 98/34 by issuing their opinions. The Commission also noted in that same paragraph of the decision at issue that, since such participation requires a high level of transparency, it regularly publishes technical regulations proposed by the Member States on its website (called `TRIS').</p>

            <p>In addition, according to recitals 3 and 6 of that directive, in order to promote the smooth functioning of the internal market, as much transparency as possible should be ensured as regards national initiatives for the establishment of technical standards or regulations, and all the Member States must be informed of the technical regulations contemplated by any one Member State. Recital 9 of that directive explains that the measures designed to ensure the proper functioning or the continued development of the market include greater transparency of national intentions and a broadening of the criteria and conditions for assessing the potential effect of the proposed regulations on the market.</p>
