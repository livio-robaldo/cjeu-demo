Its sales were concentrated in Austria and, to a lesser extent, Germany. On 29 October 1999, Roca Sanitario SA, the parent company of a group of companies active in the bathroom fittings and fixtures sector ( `the Roca group'), acquired the group whose ultimate parent was the Swiss company Keramik Holding AG, which held all the share capital of Laufen Austria.</p>

That infringement, in which 17 undertakings had allegedly participated, was said to have taken place over various periods between 16 October 1992 and 9 November 2004 and to have taken the form of anticompetitive agreements or concerted practices covering the territory of Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria. According to the decision at issue, the products covered by the cartel were bathroom fittings and fixtures belonging to the following three product sub-groups: taps and fittings, shower enclosures and accessories, and ceramic sanitary ware (ceramics) ( `the three product sub-groups').</p>

          <content eId="para_11900__content">
            <p>The Commission first determined the basic amount of the fine. To this end it explained that this amount was based, for each undertaking, on its sales by Member State, multiplied by the number of years of participation in the infringement found in the Member State in question for the relevant product group, so that account was taken of the fact that certain undertakings were active only in certain Member States or that their activities concerned only one of the three product sub-groups.</p>

            <p>After giving that explanation, the Commission set at 15% of the value of sales the multiplier linked to the gravity of the infringement found, as provided for in points 20 to 23 of the 2006 Guidelines ( `the multiplier for the ``gravity of the infringement ''').

            <p>In addition, the Commission, under point 24 of the 2006 Guidelines, set the multiplier to be applied -- to take account of the duration of the infringement found -- to the basic amount determined for Laufen Austria, at 10, which reflected 10 years' participation in the infringement, in Austria, in respect of ceramics.</p>

            <p>By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 8 September 2010, Laufen Austria brought an action for annulment of the decision at issue in so far as the decision concerned it or, in the alternative, for reduction of the fine imposed on it.</p>

            <p>In support of its claim for the partial annulment of the decision at issue, Laufen Austria put forward six pleas in law. The first plea in law concerned the imputation of liability for the anticompetitive conduct alleged against Roca Sanitario. The second plea concerned the application of the 10% ceiling. The third plea related to the Commission's assessment of the gravity of the infringement committed by Laufen Austria. The fourth plea alleged infringement of the principles of proportionality and equal treatment in so far as the context of the financial crisis had not been taken into account as a mitigating circumstance. The fifth plea concerned the failure to take into consideration, as a mitigating circumstance, the pressure exerted by the wholesalers. The sixth plea alleged errors in the application of the 2002 Leniency Notice and the 2006 Guidelines.</p>

The first ground of appeal alleges that the General Court failed in its obligation to state reasons and infringed the principle that penalties must be specific to the offender as well as the principles of personal responsibility, proportionality and equal treatment in its application of the ceiling laid down by Regulation No 1/2003. The second ground of appeal alleges that the General Court, in dismissing the claim for reduction of the basic amount of the fine imposed on Laufen Austria, infringed the principle that penalties must be specific to the offender, the principles of personal responsibility, proportionality, equal treatment and the protection of legitimate expectations and the obligation to state reasons.</p>

            <p>By its first ground of appeal, Laufen Austria maintains, in essence, that the General Court failed in its obligation to state reasons and infringed the principle that penalties must be specific to the offender and the principles of personal responsibility, proportionality and equal treatment when, in paragraphs 148 to 154 of the judgment under appeal, it took into account the total turnover of Roca Sanitario in calculating the 10% ceiling provided for in Article 23(2) of Regulation No 1/2003, including for the period in which Laufen Austria was held solely liable for the infringement in question.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, where an undertaking regarded by the Commission as responsible for an infringement of Article 101 TFEU is acquired by another undertaking within which it retains, as a subsidiary, the status of a distinct economic entity, the Commission must take account of the specific turnover of each of those economic entities for the period prior to the acquisition in order to apply to them, where necessary, the 10% ceiling (judgment of 4 September 2014, YKK and Others v Commission, C‑408/12 P, EU:C:2014:2153, paragraph 60).</p>

          <content eId="para_11926__content">
            <p>In that regard, the objective sought by the establishment, in Article 23(2), of a ceiling of 10% of the turnover of each undertaking participating in an infringement is, inter alia, to ensure that the imposition of a fine higher in amount than that ceiling should not exceed the capacity of an undertaking to make payment at the time when it is identified as responsible for the infringement and a financial penalty is imposed on it by the Commission (judgment of 4 September 2014, YKK and Others v Commission, C‑408/12 P, EU:C:2014:2153, paragraph 63).</p>

            <p>That finding is confirmed by the second subparagraph of Article 23(2) of Regulation No 1/2003 which requires, as regards the 10% ceiling, that it should be calculated on the basis of the turnover in the business year preceding the Commission decision imposing a penalty for an infringement. Such a requirement is fully respected where that ceiling is determined solely on the basis of the turnover of the subsidiary, in respect of the fine which is imposed exclusively on it, in relation to the period prior to its acquisition by the parent company. It follows that, in such circumstances, the structural changes in the undertaking responsible as an economic entity are in fact taken into account in the calculation of the fine (judgment of 4 September 2014, YKK and Others v Commission, C‑408/12 P, EU:C:2014:2153, paragraph 64).</p>

            <p>Accordingly, inasmuch as a parent company cannot be held responsible for an infringement committed by its subsidiary prior to the acquisition of that subsidiary, the Commission must take account, for the purpose of calculating the 10% ceiling, of the subsidiary's own turnover in the business year preceding the year in which the decision penalising the infringement was adopted.</p>

            <p>Consequently, the General Court made an error of law in holding, in paragraph 150 of the judgment under appeal, that, where a distinction is drawn between an initial period, in respect of which the subsidiary is held to be solely responsible for the infringement, and a second period, in respect of which the parent company is held jointly and severally liable with its subsidiary for the infringement, Article 23(2) of Regulation No 1/2003 does not require the Commission to determine whether the part of the fine, for whose payment the parent company is not held to be jointly and severally liable, is below the ceiling of 10% of the subsidiary's own turnover.</p>

Consequently, the judgment under appeal must be set aside in so far as it held that the Commission did not make an error in taking the Roca group's turnover into account for the purpose of applying the 10% ceiling in respect of the period for which Laufen Austria was held solely liable for the infringement.</p>

Laufen Austria argues in this respect that the judgment under appeal drew no distinction -- other than with regard to the geographic extent of the involvement of the participants in the infringement -- between the gravity of its conduct and the gravity of the conduct of the undertakings making up the `hard core' of participating undertakings, in order to reflect the nature of their respective actions. In accordance with the principle of non-discrimination, the General Court should have reduced the basic amount of the fine imposed on Laufen Austria, applying lower multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount' than those applied to those core undertakings and should have acted upon the findings it made in paragraphs 187, 259 and 260 of the judgment under appeal.</p>

However, in paragraphs 189 to 191 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court, on the basis of an over-restrictive and incorrect interpretation of that provision, did not allow any reduction of the fine on this account.</p>

            <p>The factors capable of affecting the assessment of the gravity of the infringements include the conduct of each of the undertakings, the role played by each of them in the establishment of the cartel, the profit which they were able to derive from the cartel, their size, the value of the goods concerned and the threat that infringements of that type pose to the objectives of the European Union (judgments of 28 June 2005, Dansk Rørindustri and Others v Commission, C‑189/02 P, C‑202/02 P, C‑205/02 P to C‑208/02 P and C‑213/02 P, EU:C:2005:408, paragraph 242, and of 11 July 2013, Team Relocations and Others v Commission, C‑444/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:464, paragraph 100).</p>

            <p>In the present case, as is clear from paragraph 179 of the judgment under appeal, it is undisputed that Laufen Austria participated in an infringement consisting in implementing the coordination of future price increases and that, because of its participation in the meetings of the umbrella organisation Arbeitskreis Sanitärindustrie, it was aware that the material scope of that infringement covered the three product sub-groups and that that infringement covered the whole of Austria.</p>

Such an infringement is among the most harmful restrictions of competition for the purposes of points 23 and 25 of the 2006 Guidelines and 15% is the lowest rate on the scale of penalties prescribed for such infringements under those guidelines (see, to that effect, judgments of 11 July 2013, Ziegler v Commission, C‑439/11 P, EU:C:2013:513, paragraphs 124 and 125, and of 11 July 2013, Team Relocations and Others v Commission, C‑444/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:464, paragraph 125).</p>

            <p>As regards the determination of the multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount', it is apparent from points 22 and 25 of the 2006 Guidelines that account must be taken of a number of factors, in particular those set out in point 22 of those guidelines. Although, in order to assess the gravity of an infringement and subsequently set the fine to be imposed, account may be taken, inter alia, of the geographic extent of an infringement, the fact that the geographic scope of one infringement is more extensive than that of another does not, on its own, necessarily mean that the first infringement, considered as a whole, and in particular in the light of its nature, must be classified as more serious than the second and as therefore justifying the setting of higher multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount' than those used in the calculation of the fine for the second infringement (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 July 2014, Telefónica and Telefónica de España v Commission, C‑295/12 P, EU:C:2014:2062, paragraph 178).</p>

            <p>It must nonetheless be recalled that the principle of equal treatment is a general principle of EU law enshrined in Articles 20 and 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. According to settled case-law, that principle requires that comparable situations must not be treated differently and different situations must not be treated in the same way unless such treatment is objectively justified (see, inter alia, judgment of 12 November 2014, Guardian Industries and Guardian Europe v Commission, C‑580/12 P, EU:C:2014:2363, paragraph 51).</p>

            <p>Observance of that principle is binding on the General Court not only in the exercise of its review of the legality of the Commission's decision imposing fines but also in the exercise of its unlimited jurisdiction. When the amount of the fines imposed is determined, the exercise of such jurisdiction cannot result in discrimination between undertakings which have participated in an agreement or concerted practice contrary to Article 101(1) TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 18 December 2014, Commission v Parker Hannifin Manufacturing and Parker-Hannifin, C‑434/13 P, EU:C:2014:2456, paragraph 77).</p>

            <p>It follows from the case-law of the Court of Justice, however, that the taking into account, by virtue of the principle of equal treatment, of differences between the undertakings that have participated in a single cartel (in particular with regard to the geographic scope of their respective involvement) for the purpose of assessing the gravity of an infringement need not necessarily occur when the multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount' are set but may occur at another stage in the setting of the fine, such as when the basic amount of the fine is adjusted in the light of mitigating and aggravating circumstances under points 28 and 29 of the 2006 Guidelines (see, to that effect, judgments of 11 July 2013, Gosselin Group v Commission, C‑429/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:463, paragraphs 96 to 100, and of 11 July 2013, Team Relocations and Others v Commission, C‑444/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:464, paragraphs 104 and 105).</p>

            <p>As the Commission has observed, such differences may also be reflected by means of the value of sales that is used in calculating the basic amount of the fine inasmuch as that value reflects, for each participating undertaking, the scale of its involvement in the infringement in question, in accordance with point 13 of the 2006 Guidelines, under which it is possible to take as a starting point for the calculation of the fines an amount which reflects the economic significance of the infringement and the size of the undertaking's contribution to it (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 July 2013, Team Relocations and Others v Commission, C‑444/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:464, paragraph 76).</p>

            <p>Consequently, since it is not disputed that the basic amount of the fines imposed on Laufen Austria was determined by reference to the value of the sales made by it in Austria, the General Court could, in paragraphs 186 and 187 and 259 and 260 of the judgment under appeal, set the multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount' at 15% of that value without infringing the principle of equal treatment.</p>

            <p>Although it follows from the previous paragraphs that the reasoning of the General Court in paragraphs 186 and 187 and 259 and 260 of the judgment under appeal is vitiated by errors of law, it must be recalled that, if the grounds of a decision of the General Court contain an infringement of EU law but its operative part is shown to be well founded on other legal grounds, such an infringement is not one that should cause that decision to be set aside, and a substitution of grounds must be made (see, to that effect, judgments of 9 June 1992, Lestelle v Commission, C‑30/91 P, EU:C:1992:252, paragraph 28, and of 9 September 2008, FIAMM and Others v Council and Commission, C‑120/06 P and C‑121/06 P, EU:C:2008:476, paragraph 187 and the case-law cited).</p>
