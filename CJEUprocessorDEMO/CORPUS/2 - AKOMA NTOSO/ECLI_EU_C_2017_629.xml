                <p>Mr Zdziaszek was summoned to the first hearing of 28 January 2014 at the address which he had supplied. He did not respond to the summons and did not appear at that hearing. The Sąd Rejonowy w Wejherowie (District Court, Wejherowo), of its own motion, assigned a lawyer to represent Mr Zdziaszek and then stayed the proceedings. Mr Zdziaszek was similarly summoned to a second hearing on 25 March 2014, at which he did not appear. The lawyer assigned ex officio participated in the hearing at the end of which the judgment handing down a cumulative sentence was given.</p>

            <p>The referring court is uncertain, first of all, whether a decision such as the judgment handing down a cumulative sentence of 25 March 2014 amending, in favour of the person concerned, a cumulative custodial sentence to which he had previously been finally sentenced and commuting into one single custodial sentence the separate custodial sentences which had previously been imposed on him by a final judgment, but in the context of which the question of whether or not the person concerned had committed the offences is no longer at issue, comes within the scope of Article 4a(1) of Framework Decision 2002/584.</p>

            <p>Nonetheless, that court takes the view that the question raised calls for a negative response, essentially because of the wording of subparagraphs (c) and (d) of Article 4a(1) of the Framework Decision, which in both cases use the terms `which allows the merits of the case, including fresh evidence, to be re-examined'.</p>

            <p>In the view of the referring court, it follows from that wording that it refers to the situation in which the criminal court has ruled on the merits of the case, in that it has ruled on the guilt of the person concerned in relation to the alleged infringement, and, where appropriate, imposed a penalty for the offence committed. In contrast, that is not so in the case of a judgment handing down a cumulative sentence, such as that handed down on 25 March 2014 by the Sąd Rejonowy w Wejherowie (District Court, Wejherowo), since the question of the guilt of the person concerned is no longer at issue in the context of such proceedings.</p>

            <p>In the event that the first question is answered in the negative, the referring court takes the view that it must then examine whether, at the stage of the conviction underlying the judgment handing down a cumulative sentence, the person concerned appeared in person at the trial which led to that finding of guilt and, if not, whether one of the situations referred to in points (a) to (d) of Article 4a(1) of Framework Decision 2002/584 applies.</p>

            <p>In the present case, as regards the underlying judgment, the Polish judicial authorities, at the request of the Dutch Public Prosecutor's Office, provided additional information according to which Mr Zdziaszek did not appear in person during the proceedings relating to the substance of the case, whether at first instance or on appeal.</p>

            <p>As regards the applicability of one of the circumstances referred to in subparagraphs (a) to (d) of Article 4a(1) of Framework Decision 2002/584, the referring court notes that the issuing judicial authority did not use point (d)(2) of the European arrest warrant form, nor did it state which of the categories set out in point 3 of paragraph (d) of the European arrest warrant form is applicable.</p>

            <p>Thus, it is possible to deduce from the wording `unless the European arrest warrant indicates that', used in the introductory sentence of Article 4a(1) of the Framework Decision 2002/584, that the information on the applicability of one of the situations referred to in points (a) to (d) of that provision must in principle be set out in point (d) of the European arrest warrant or, at least, in accordance with the wording of the categories therein described.</p>

            <p>Such an interpretation is also consistent with the objectives of that Framework Decision, namely, first, to ensure that the final decision on the execution of the European arrest warrant is taken within the prescribed period, with the result that it is important to reduce to a minimum cases requiring requests for additional information, secondly, to provide for a precise and uniform ground for refusal, and, thirdly, to allow the executing judicial authority to ensure in a simple and transparent manner that the rights of the defence of the person concerned are effectively upheld.</p>

            <p>The referring court states that the rights of the defence are part of the right to a fair trial within the meaning of Article 6 of the ECHR and Article 47 of the Charter, with the result that once a Member State has established an appeal procedure, it is required to ensure that the person concerned enjoys, within the framework of that procedure, the fundamental guarantees laid down in those provisions. Thus, although the person concerned has the right to waive his rights of defence, the fact remains that, as the European Court of Human Rights has held, the criminal court, which is called upon once more to rule on the guilt of the person concerned, may not issue a ruling without a direct assessment of the evidence presented in person by an accused who wishes to prove that he did not commit the purportedly criminal act. In such a case, the mere fact that the person concerned has been able to exercise his rights of defence at first instance is, therefore, insufficient for it to be concluded that the requirements of Article 6 ECHR and Article 47 of the Charter have been met.</p>

It could therefore be argued that, once it has been established that the rights of the defence of the person concerned were fully upheld in the proceedings at first instance, the principle of mutual trust requires it to be held that the authorities of the issuing Member State have not disregarded the fundamental rights recognised by EU law in other proceedings.

            <p>Secondly, as regards the criterion relating to urgency, it is necessary, in accordance with the settled case-law of the Court, to take into account the fact that the person concerned in the case in the main proceedings is currently deprived of his liberty and that the question as to whether he may continue to be held in custody depends on the outcome of the dispute in the main proceedings (see, in particular, judgment of 10 November 2016, Kovalkovas, C‑477/16 PPU, EU:C:2016:861, paragraph 21 and the case-law cited). Moreover, the situation of the person concerned must be assessed as it stood at the time when consideration was given to whether the reference should be dealt with under the urgent procedure (judgment of 24 May 2016, Dworzecki, C‑108/16 PPU, EU:C:2016:346, paragraph 22 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the present case, first, it is common ground that, on that date, Mr Zdziaszek was deprived of his liberty.

              <p>The first and third questions</p>
            </tblock>
            <p>75 By its first and third questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court essentially asks whether the concept of `trial resulting in the decision', within the meaning of Article 4a(1) of Framework Decision 2002/584, must be interpreted as referring to the appeal proceedings and/or to proceedings for the amendment of custodial sentences handed down previously, such as those which led to the judgment handing down a cumulative sentence at issue in the main proceedings.</p>

          <num>76</num>
          <content eId="para_15736__content">
            <p>In order to answer those questions as reformulated, it must be borne in mind, first of all, that, as is apparent from paragraphs 81, 90 and 98 of today's judgment, Tupikas(C‑270/17 PPU), for the purposes of the application of Article 4a(1) of Framework Decision 2002/584, the concept of `trial resulting in the decision' must be interpreted as referring, in the case where the proceedings have taken place over several instances which have given rise to successive decisions, at least one of which was handed down in absentia, to only the appeal proceedings, in so far as the decision handed down at the end of those proceedings has finally found the person concerned guilty and determined the penalty, such as a custodial sentence, after a further examination of the merits of the case in fact and in law.</p>
          </content>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph eId="para_15737">
          <num>77</num>
          <content eId="para_15737__content">
            <p>It is true that, in principle, such a conviction has two distinct but related aspects, namely the finding of guilt and the handing down of a sentence, a custodial sentence in this case (see today's judgment, Tupikas, C‑270/17 PPU, paragraphs 78 and 83).</p>
          </content>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph eId="para_15738">
          <num>78</num>
          <content eId="para_15738__content">
            <p>The fact remains, however, that, even if, as in the case in the main proceedings, the quantum of the penalty imposed is amended in a subsequent proceeding, the decision resulting from appeal proceedings with the characteristics set out in paragraph 76 of the present judgment remains relevant for the purposes of the verifications to be carried out by the executing judicial authority under Article 4a(1) of Framework Decision 2002/584.</p>
          </content>

          <num>79</num>
          <content eId="para_15739__content">
            <p>For the same reasons as those set out in paragraphs 83 and 84 of today's judgment, Tupikas(C‑270/17 PPU), the final finding of guilt at the end of the appeal proceedings directly affects the situation of the person concerned, all the more so as it constitutes the legal basis for the custodial sentence which the person concerned must serve.</p>

          <content eId="para_15740__content">
            <p>It is therefore essential that the person concerned be able to exercise his rights of defence fully before a final decision is taken as to his guilt.</p>

          <content eId="para_15741__content">
            <p>It should further be stated that, as also follows from paragraphs 85 and 86 of today's judgment, Tupikas(C‑270/17 PPU), the appeal proceedings are all the more decisive in the context of Article 4a(1) of Framework Decision 2002/584 since the full and effective observance of the rights of the defence at that stage of the proceedings is such as to remedy a possible breach of those rights during a prior stage of the criminal proceedings.</p>

          <content eId="para_15742__content">
            <p>It is therefore necessary to conclude, on that aspect of the first and third questions, that the concept of `trial resulting in the decision' within the meaning of Article 4a(1) of the Framework Decision must be interpreted as covering the appeal proceedings that led to the decision which, after a new examination of the merits of the case in fact and in law, finally determined the guilt of the person concerned and imposed the penalty upon him, such as a custodial sentence, even though the sentence handed down was amended by a subsequent decision.</p>

          <content eId="para_15743__content">
            <p>Secondly, it is necessary to determine whether a decision at a later stage of the proceedings amending one or more of the custodial sentences previously imposed, such as the cumulative sentence at issue in the case in the main proceedings, is covered by Article 4a(1) of the Framework Decision.</p>

          <content eId="para_15744__content">
            <p>As is apparent from the case file before the Court, first, such a decision, although taken after one or more decisions sentencing the person concerned to one or more penalties, does not affect the finding of guilt set out in the previous decisions, that conviction therefore being final.</p>
          </content>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph eId="para_15745">
          <num>85</num>
          <content eId="para_15745__content">
            <p>Next, such a decision modifies the quantum of the penalty or penalties imposed. It is therefore necessary to make a distinction between measures of that type and those relating to the methods of execution of a custodial sentence. It is moreover apparent from the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights that Article 6(1) of the ECHR does not apply to questions concerning the methods for executing a sentence, in particular those relating to provisional release (see, to that effect, ECtHR, 3 April 2012, Boulois v. Luxembourg, CE:ECHR:2012:0403JUD003757504, § 87).</p>

          <content eId="para_15746__content">
            <p>Finally, proceedings leading to a decision, such as the judgment handing down a cumulative sentence at issue in the main proceedings, consisting in commuting into a single sentence one or more sentences handed down previously in respect of the person concerned, necessarily results in a more favorable result for that person. Thus, for example, a lighter penalty may be imposed following the entry into force of new legislation which penalises the relevant offence less severely. In addition, following several convictions, each of which involves the imposition of a sentence, the sentences may be combined to obtain a cumulative sentence which is less than the sum of the various sentences resulting from previous separate decisions.</p>

          <content eId="para_15747__content">
            <p>In that regard, it is apparent from the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights that the guarantees laid down in Article 6 of the ECHR apply not only to the finding of guilt, but also to the determination of the sentence (see, to that effect, ECtHR, 28 November 2013, Dementyev v. Russia, CE:ECHR:2013:1128JUD004309505, § 23). Thus, compliance with the requirement of a fair trial entails the right of the person concerned to be present at the hearing because of the significant consequences which it may have on the quantum of the sentence to be imposed (see, to that effect, ECtHR, 21 September 1993, Kremzov v. Austria, CE:ECHR:1993:0921JUD001235086, § 67).</p>

          <content eId="para_15748__content">
            <p>This is the case with respect to specific proceedings for the determination of an overall sentence where those proceedings are not a purely formal and arithmetic exercise but entail a margin of discretion in the determination of the level of the sentence, in particular, by taking account of the situation or personality of the person concerned, or of mitigating or aggravating circumstances (see ECtHR, 15 July 1982, Eckle v. Germany, CE:ECHR:1983:0621JUD000813078, § 77, and 28 November 2013, Dementyev v. Russia, CE:ECHR:2013:1128JUD004309505, § 25 and 26).</p>

          <content eId="para_15749__content">
            <p>Furthermore, it is irrelevant in that regard whether the court concerned has jurisdiction to increase the sentence previously imposed (see, to that effect, ECtHR, 26 May 1988, Ekbatani v. Sweden, CE:ECHR:1988:0526JUD001056383, § 32, and 18 October 2006, Hermi v. Italy, CE:ECHR:2006:1018JUD001811402, § 65).</p>

          <content eId="para_15750__content">
            <p>It follows that proceedings giving rise to a judgment handing down a cumulative sentence, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, leading to a new determination of the level of custodial sentences imposed previously, must be regarded as relevant for the application of Article 4a(1) of Framework Decision 2002/584, where they entail a margin of discretion for the competent authority within the meaning of paragraph 88 of the present judgment and give rise to a decision which finally determines the sentence.</p>

            <p>The fact that the new sentence is hypothetically more favourable to the person concerned is irrelevant since the level of the sentence is not determined in advance but depends on the assessment of the facts of the case by the competent authority and it is precisely the duration of the sentence to be served which is finally handed down which is of decisive importance for the person concerned.</p>

          <content eId="para_15753__content">
            <p>In the light of the grounds set out above, it must be held that, in a case such as that at issue in the main proceedings, where, following appeal proceedings in which the merits of the case were re-examined, a decision finally determined the guilt of the person concerned and also imposed a custodial sentence on him, the level of which was however amended by a subsequent decision taken by the competent authority after it had exercised its discretion in that matter and which finally determined the sentence, both decisions must be taken into account for the purposes of the application of Article 4a(1) of Framework Decision 2002/584.</p>

            <p>As is apparent, respectively, from paragraphs 76 to 80 and 90 to 92 of the present judgment, it is necessary to ensure that the rights of the defence are observed in respect of both the finding of guilt and the final determination of the sentence and, where those two aspects, which are in any case closely linked, are dissociated, the final decisions handed down in that regard must, in the same way, be subject to the verifications required by that provision. That provision seeks precisely to strengthen the procedural rights of the persons concerned by ensuring that their fundamental right to a fair trial is guaranteed (see, to that effect, today's judgment, Tupikas, C‑270/17 PPU, paragraphs 58 and 61 to 63) and, as stated in paragraph 87 of the present judgment, those requirements apply both in respect of the finding of guilt and the determination of the sentence.</p>

            <p>In order to give a useful answer to that question, it should be borne in mind that the checks required by Article 4a(1) of Framework Decision 2002/584 must in principle relate to the last instances at which the merits of the case were examined and which led to the final conviction of the person concerned (see, to that effect, today's judgment, Tupikas, C‑270/17 PPU, paragraphs 81, 90 and 91). In the particular case, examined in the context of the reply given to the first and third questions, in which the level of the sentence initially imposed has been finally amended pursuant to new proceedings involving the exercise of a discretion, both proceedings, as is apparent from paragraphs 93, 94 and 96 of the present judgment, are relevant in that regard.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, the issuing judicial authority is required to provide the information referred to in Article 8(1) of Framework Decision 2002/584 in relation to the first of those proceedings or, as the case may be, to both proceedings.</p>

            <p>Having regard to the system established by that provision and as is apparent from its very wording, the executing judicial authority is entitled to refuse to execute a European arrest warrant issued for the purpose of executing a custodial sentence or a detention order if the person concerned did not appear in person at the trial resulting in the decision, unless the European arrest warrant indicates that the conditions set out in subparagraphs (a), (b), (c) or (d) of that provision are met.</p>

            <p>In the event that that authority takes the view that it does not have sufficient information to enable it to validly decide on the surrender of the person concerned, it is incumbent upon it to apply Article 15(2) of Framework Decision 2002/584, by requesting from the issuing judicial authority the urgent provision of such additional information as it deems necessary before a decision on surrender can be taken.</p>

            <p>That authority not only cannot tolerate a breach of fundamental rights but, as provided for in Article 15(2) of Framework Decision 2002/584, it must also ensure that the time limits laid down in Article 17 thereof for taking the decision on the European arrest warrant are complied with, with the result that it cannot be required to resort to that Article 15(2) again (see, to that effect judgment of 5 April 2016, Aranyosi and Căldăraru, C‑404/15 and C‑659/15 PPU, EU:C:2016:198, paragraph 97).</p>

            <p>However, it should be pointed out in that context that Article 4a of Framework Decision 2002/584 provides for an optional ground for non-execution of the European arrest warrant and that the cases referred to in Article 4a(1)(a) to (d) were conceived as exceptions to that optional ground for non-recognition (see, to that effect, today's judgment, Tupikas, C‑270/17 PPU, paragraphs 50 and 96).</p>

            <p>Accordingly, the Court has already held that the executing judicial authority may, even after it has found that those cases do not cover the situation of the person who is the subject of the European arrest warrant, take account of other circumstances that enable it to ensure that the surrender of the person concerned does not entail a breach of his rights of defence (see, to that effect, judgment of 24 May 2016, Dworzecki, C‑108/16 PPU, EU:C:2016:346, paragraphs 50 and 51).</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fifth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. The concept of `trial resulting in the decision', within the meaning of Article 4a(1) of Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States, as amended by Council Framework Decision 2009/299/JHA of 26 February 2009, must be interpreted as referring not only to the proceedings which gave rise to the decision on appeal, where that decision, after a fresh examination of the case on the merits, finally determined the guilt of the person concerned, but also to subsequent proceedings, such as those that led to the judgment handing down the cumulative sentence at issue here, at the end of which the decision that finally amended the level of the initial sentence was handed down, inasmuch as the authority which adopted the latter decision enjoyed a certain discretion in that regard. 2. Framework Decision 2002/584, as amended by Framework Decision 2009/299, must be interpreted as meaning that, where the person concerned has not appeared in person in the relevant proceeding or, as the case may be, in the relevant proceedings for the application of Article 4a(1) of that Framework Decision, as amended, and where neither the information contained in the standard form for a European arrest warrant annexed to that Framework Decision nor the information obtained pursuant to Article 15(2) of that Framework Decision, as amended, provide sufficient evidence to establish the existence of one of the situations referred to in Article 4a(1)(a) to (d) of Framework Decision 2002/584, as amended, the executing judicial authority may refuse to execute the European arrest warrant. However, that Framework Decision, as amended, does not prevent that authority from taking account of all the circumstances characterising the case brought before it in order to ensure that the rights of the defence of the person concerned are respected during the relevant proceeding or proceedings.</p>
