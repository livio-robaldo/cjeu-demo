            <p>Article 132 of Directive 2006/112 provides for exemptions which, as indicated by the title of the chapter in which that provision is contained, are intended to encourage certain activities in the public interest. However, those exemptions do not cover every activity performed in the public interest, but only those listed in that provision and described in great detail (judgment of 25 February 2016, Commission v Netherlands, Câ€‘22/15, not published, EU:C:2016:118, paragraph 19 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_7018__content">
            <p>The terms used to specify those exemptions are to be interpreted strictly, since they constitute exceptions to the general principle, arising from Article 2 of Directive 2006/112, that VAT is to be levied on all services supplied for consideration by a taxable person. However, that requirement of strict interpretation does not mean that the terms used to specify the exemptions referred to in Article 132 should be construed in such a way as to deprive them of their intended effect (judgment of 25 February 2016, Commission v Netherlands, Câ€‘22/15, not published, EU:C:2016:118, paragraph 20 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>The term `closely related', contained in Article 132(1)(i) of Directive 2006/112, is not defined therein. Nevertheless, it is clear from the wording of that provision that it relates to the supply of services which are closely linked to `children's or young people's education, school or university education, vocational training or retraining'. Thus, a supply of services can be regarded as `closely related' to those latter services only where they are actually supplied as services ancillary to the education provided by the relevant establishment, which constitutes the principal supply (see, to that effect, judgments of 14 June 2007, Horizon College, Câ€‘434/05, EU:C:2007:343, paragraphs 27 and 28 and the case-law cited, and 25 March 2010, Commission v Netherlands, Câ€‘79/09, not published, EU:C:2010:171, paragraph 50).</p>

            <p>In accordance with the Court's case-law, a service may be regarded as ancillary to a principal supply if it does not constitute an end in itself, but a means of better enjoying the principal supply (judgment of 25 March 2010, Commission v Netherlands, Câ€‘79/09, not published, EU:C:2010:171, paragraph 51 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In that regard, the application of the exemption for activities `closely related' to education is, in any event, subject to three conditions, laid down, in part, in Articles 132 and 134 of Directive 2006/112. In essence, first, both the principal supply and the supplies of services closely related to it must be provided by bodies referred to in Article 132(1)(i) of that directive; secondly, those supplies of services must be essential to the exempt activities; and, thirdly, the basic purpose of those supplies of services must not be to obtain additional income for those bodies by carrying out transactions which are in direct competition with those of commercial enterprises liable for VAT (see, to that effect, judgments of 14 June 2007, Horizon College, Câ€‘434/05, EU:C:2007:343, paragraphs 34, 38 and 42, and 25 March 2010, Commission v Netherlands, Câ€‘79/09, not published, EU:C:2010:171, paragraph 61).</p>

            <p>In the case in the main proceedings, it is common ground, as regards the first of those conditions, that the College is a body governed by public law with an educational objective and is therefore eligible for the exemption provided for in Article 132(1)(i) of Directive 2006/112.</p>

            <p>As regards the second condition, it follows from paragraph 39 of the judgment of 14 June in Horizon College ( Câ€‘434/05, EU:C:2007:343), that, in order to be classified as supplies of services essential to the exempt activities, those supplies must be of a nature and quality such that, without recourse to them, there could be no assurance that the education provided by the body referred to in Article 132(1)(i) of Directive 2006/112 and, consequently, the education from which their students benefit, would have an equivalent value.</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is apparent from the order for reference that the practical training was designed to form an integral part of the student's curriculum and that, if it were not provided, students would not fully benefit from their education.</p>

            <p>In that regard, the order for reference notes that the catering functions of the restaurant are all undertaken by students of the College, under the supervision of their tutors, and that the purpose of operating the College's training restaurant is to enable the students enrolled in catering and hospitality courses to learn skills in a practical context.</p>

            <p>That finding is corroborated by the assertion of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland that the College's training restaurant is tantamount to a classroom for the students, and the assertion of the European Commission that students benefit from preparing meals and performing table service in a real-life setting, which is an important part of their education.</p>

            <p>As regards the third condition, it must be noted that that condition is an express enunciation of the principle of fiscal neutrality, which precludes, in particular, treating similar supplies of services, which are thus in competition with each other, differently for VAT purposes (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 June 2007, Horizon College, Câ€‘434/05, EU:C:2007:343, paragraph 34 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the main proceedings, it is common ground, first of all, that the restaurant and entertainment services provided by the College are open only to people previously registered on a mailing list held by that establishment. In particular, the referring court has stated that, for the performances, the audience usually consists of the friends and family of the College students, as well as people previously registered on the College's database.</p>

            <p>Further, the College's training restaurant is available only by reservation and upon the condition that it be fully booked, with a minimum of thirty covers being required for the students to obtain maximum benefit from their supply of services. Thus, meals are cancelled if the required threshold is not reached, unlike in a commercial restaurant where reservations are in principle unconditionally honoured.</p>

          <content eId="para_7033__content">
            <p>Lastly, it is clear from the information provided by the referring court that the concerts, performances and restaurant services are entirely organised, carried out and supplied by students enrolled at the College, a situation which is fundamentally different from that of students undertaking an internship in a commercial entity, where they join a professional team supplying such services in the competitive conditions prevailing in the respective markets.</p>

            <p>It thus appears that the services offered by the College, as part of the courses taught to its students, to a limited number of third parties, are substantially different from those habitually offered by a commercial theatre or restaurant and are aimed at a different public, in that they do not meet the same needs of the consumer.</p>

          <content eId="para_7035__content">
            <p>Furthermore, it is not disputed that the prices charged by the College cover only 80% of the cost of the meals. It does not therefore appear that the services at issue in the main proceedings are intended to generate additional income for the College by carrying out transactions in direct competition with those of commercial enterprises subject to VAT, such as restaurants or theatres.</p>

            <p>Consequently, the services offered by the College to a limited number of third parties do not appear to be comparable to those offered by commercial restaurants and theatres, and the exemption from VAT for services supplied by the College does not amount to a difference in tax treatment.</p>

            <p>In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the questions referred is that Article 132(1)(i) of Directive 2006/112 must be interpreted as meaning that activities carried out in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, consisting in students of a higher education establishment supplying, for consideration and as part of their education, restaurant and entertainment services to third parties, may be regarded as supplies `closely related' to the principal supply of education and accordingly be exempt from VAT, provided that those services are essential to the students' education and that their basic purpose is not to obtain additional income for that establishment by carrying out transactions in direct competition with those of commercial enterprises liable for VAT, which it is for the national court to determine.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court.

On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules: Article 132(1)(i) of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax, must be interpreted as meaning that activities carried out in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, consisting in students of a higher education establishment supplying, for consideration and as part of their education, restaurant and entertainment services to third parties, may be regarded as supplies `closely related' to the principal supply of education and accordingly be exempt from value added tax (VAT), provided that those services are essential to the students' education and that their basic purpose is not to obtain additional income for that establishment by carrying out transactions which are in direct competition with those of commercial enterprises liable for VAT, which it is for the national court to determine.</p>
