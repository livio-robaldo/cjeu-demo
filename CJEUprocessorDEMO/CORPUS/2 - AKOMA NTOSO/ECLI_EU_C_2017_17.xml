            <p>The referring court is unsure whether the incentives linked to the general electricity charges falls within the scope of Article 17(1) thereof, which deals with tax reductions. In that regard, it explains that those charges are intended to finance objectives in the general interest, such as the promotion of renewable energy sources (A3 component) and energy efficiency (UC7 component), the costs of nuclear safety and territorial clearance payments (A2 and MCT components), the special tariff schemes for the national railway company (A4 component), compensation intended for small undertakings in the electricity sector (UC4 component), support for applied research in the electricity sector (A5 component) and covering the `electricity bonus' (As component) and incentives granted to energy-intensive businesses (Ae component). According to that court, the general electricity charges are charged to electricity consumers and apportioned between them, including businesses, by being entered on the electricity bills.</p>

            <p>Since the incentives linked to the general electricity charges must be regarded as tax reductions, the referring court asks whether Article 17(1) of Directive 2003/96 permits Member States which introduce such reductions under that provision to grant them solely to certain energy-intensive businesses operating in sectors designated by the national authorities in order to pursue objectives in the general interest.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the Consiglio di Stato (Council of State) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling: `1. Do Italian rules (such as those at issue in the main proceedings) which, firstly, include a definition of ``energy-intensive businesses '' in line with the directive and, secondly, grant companies of this type payment incentives covering general electricity charges (and not incentives relating to taxation of energy products and electricity as such) fall within the scope of Directive [2003/96]? 2. Does EU law, and in particular Articles 11 and 17 of Directive [2003/96], preclude a regulatory and administrative system (such as that in force in Italian law and described in the present order) which, firstly, opts to introduce a system of concessions on the consumption of energy products (electricity) by ``energy-intensive businesses '' within the meaning of the above-mentioned Article 17 and, secondly, restricts the possibility of benefiting from those concessions to ``energy-intensive '' businesses operating in the manufacturing sector only, thereby excluding businesses operating in other production sectors?'</p>

            <p>The answer to that question depends on whether the amounts covering general electricity charges are fiscal in nature and, more particularly, constitute indirect taxation, referred to in Article 4(2) of Directive 2003/96.</p>

            <p>However, it must be borne in mind that the nature of a tax, duty or charge must be determined by the Court, under EU law, according to the objective characteristics by which it is levied, irrespective of its classification under national law (see judgments of 12 December 2006, Test Claimants in the FII Group Litigation, C‑446/04, EU:C:2006:774, paragraph 107, and of 24 June 2010, P.

            <p>Firstly, it must be noted that, as is apparent from the order for reference, the amounts covering general electricity charges are laid down in Italian law and, in particular, in Article 39(3) of Decree-Law No 83/2012.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, for the purposes of classification of the amounts covering general electricity charges as tax, there must be an obligation to pay those amounts and, where that obligation is not satisfied, the debtor must be pursued by the competent authorities, provided that, in the case of indirect taxation, the person legally liable to pay is not necessarily the end consumer who has in turn been charged those amounts (see, by analogy, as regards VAT, judgment of 14 January 2016, Commission v Belgium, C‑163/14, EU:C:2016:4, paragraph 44).</p>

            <p>Secondly, as is also apparent from the order for reference, the amounts covering general electricity charges are intended to finance not necessarily the electricity production and distribution costs but objectives in the general interest, in accordance with the allocation criteria laid down by the public authorities, on the basis of the guidelines of the Minister for Economic Development of 24 July 2013 and the decisions of the Electrical Energy and Gas Authority adopted in October 2013, in the context of the national electricity system. Those objectives include the promotion of renewable energy sources and energy efficiency, nuclear safety and territorial clearance payments, the special tariff schemes for the national railway company, compensation intended for small undertakings in the electricity sector, support for applied research in the electricity sector and covering the `electricity bonus' and incentives granted to energy-intensive businesses.</p>

            <p>In that context, it must be noted that the fact that the amounts covering general electricity charges are not intended for the general national budget but, as the Italian Government states, are paid to the management accounts of the Electricity Industry Equalisation Fund and allocated to certain categories of operators for specific uses cannot of itself preclude them from coming within the field of direct taxation (see, by analogy, judgment of 15 April 2010, CIBA, C‑96/08, EU:C:2010:185, paragraph 23).</p>

            <p>Thirdly, as regards, more specifically, indirect taxation, it must be noted that such duties are typically charged to the end consumer of the goods or service supplied by their inclusion in the amount on the invoice sent to him (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 January 2016, Commission v Belgium, C‑163/14, EU:C:2016:4, paragraph 39).</p>

            <p>In that regard, the referring court points out that the general electricity charges are charged to electricity consumers and apportioned between them, including businesses, by being entered on their electricity bills.

            <p>For those reasons, the amounts covering general electricity charges cannot be compared with the tax at issue in the case which gave rise to the judgment of 4 June 2015, Kernkraftwerke Lippe-Ems ( C‑5/14, EU:C:2015:354), in which the Court took the view that that tax could not be regarded calculated directly or indirectly on the basis of the quantity of electricity at the time of release for consumption of that product within the meaning of Article 4(2) of Directive 2003/96. The Court based that conclusion on the findings in paragraphs 62 and 63 of that judgment that the tax was calculated in particular on the quantity of nuclear fuel used to produce electricity and that that quantity was not directly commensurate with the amount of electricity produced, so that the tax could be levied without any electricity having necessarily even been produced or, as a consequence, consumed.</p>
