In order for a worker to take partial retirement, ... he shall agree with his employer to a reduction in working hours and remuneration of at least 25% and no more than 75%, ... At the same time the employer shall conclude a ``relief '' contract, in accordance with the provisions of the following paragraph, in order to cover the working hours no longer covered as a result of the worker taking partial retirement. A ``relief '' contract may equally be concluded in order to replace workers taking partial retirement after reaching the age of 65. There may be an 85% reduction in working hours and remuneration where the ``relief '' contract is concluded for an indefinite duration on a full-time basis ... The performance of that part-time employment contract and remuneration under the contract shall be compatible with the retirement pension granted to the worker by social security in respect of partial retirement. The employment relationship shall come to an end when the worker takes full retirement. 7.   The ``relief '' contract shall be governed by the following rules:</p>

Where a worker takes partial retirement after reaching the age of 65, the ``relief '' contract that may be concluded by the employer in order to cover the working time no longer covered by that worker may be of indefinite duration or annual. In the latter case, the contract shall be extended automatically from year to year and terminate in the way described in the preceding subparagraph. ...</p>

            <p>On 1 November 2012, Mr Moreira Gómez concluded a relief employment contract ( ` contrato de relevo') with Grupo Norte, pursuant to Article 12(6) of the Workers' Statute, to work as cleaner 28.12 hours per week -- that being 75% of normal working hours -- at the Montecelo Hospital in Pontevedra, for which Grupo Norte was the cleaning contractor. The purpose of that contract was to replace Mr Moreira Gómez's mother who had occupied that post and taken partial retirement, reducing her working hours and remuneration by 75%. The parties to the contract agreed that it would terminate on 18 September 2015, the date on which Mr Moreira Gómez's mother was to take full retirement.</p>

Although a fixed-term employment contract may also be terminated on the basis of objective circumstances -- namely, a specific date being reached, completion of the specific task covered by the contract or the occurrence of a specific event -- the compensation awarded in such a case is only twelve days' remuneration per year of service, pursuant to Article 49(1)(c) of the statute.

            <p>In addition, by establishing the fixed-term relief employment contract, the Spanish legislator derogated from the principle of stable employment, both in order to allow businesses to engage temporary workers and establish criteria for determining the end of their employment contracts, and to give them the means of ridding themselves of a comparable worker engaged under an employment contract of indefinite duration. However, the termination of a fixed-term relief employment contract and the termination of a contract of indefinite duration give rise to the payment of different amounts of compensation.</p>

            <p>Grupo Norte contends that the first and second questions are inadmissible. In its opinion, the first question concerns the comparison of the various reasons that may, under Spanish law, lead to termination of an employment contract. The referring court is therefore seeking to obtain from the Court an interpretation, not of EU law, but of national law. In addition, by its second question, the referring court is merely seeking a review by the Court of the social-policy reasons that justified the creation by the Spanish legislator of the relief employment contract. It contends, therefore, that the Court lacks jurisdiction to answer those questions.</p>

            <p>It should be recalled in that regard that, according to Clause 1(a) of the Framework Agreement, one of its objectives is to improve the quality of fixed-term work by ensuring the application of the principle of non-discrimination. Similarly, the third paragraph in the preamble to the Framework Agreement states that it `illustrates the willingness of the Social Partners to establish a general framework for ensuring equal treatment for fixed-term workers by protecting them against discrimination'. Recital 14 of Directive 1999/70 states, to this end, that the aim of the Framework Agreement is, inter alia, to improve the quality of fixed-term work by setting out minimum requirements in order to ensure the application of the principle of non-discrimination (judgments of 22 December 2010, Gavieiro Gavieiro and Iglesias Torres, C‑444/09 and C‑456/09, EU:C:2010:819, paragraph 47; of 12 December 2013, Carratù, C‑361/12, EU:C:2013:830, paragraph 40, and of 13 March 2014, Nierodzik, C‑38/13, EU:C:2014:152, paragraph 22).</p>

            <p>It is therefore necessary, second, to establish whether the payment of compensation by an employer on account of the termination of an employment contract falls within the concept of `employment conditions' within the meaning of Clause 4(1) of the Framework Agreement. In that regard, the Court has held that the decisive criterion for determining whether a measure falls within the scope of that concept is the criterion of employment, that is to say the employment relationship between a worker and his employer (judgments of 12 December 2013, Carratù, C‑361/12, EU:C:2013:830, paragraph 35, and of 13 March 2014, Nierodzik, C‑38/13, EU:C:2014:152, paragraph 25).</p>

Those factors may be apparent, in particular, from the specific nature of the tasks for the performance of which fixed-term contracts have been concluded and from the inherent characteristics of those tasks or, as the case may be, from pursuit of a legitimate social-policy objective of a Member State (judgments of 13 September 2007, Del Cerro Alonso, C‑307/05, EU:C:2007:509, paragraph 53, and of 14 September 2016, de Diego Porras, C‑596/14, EU:C:2016:683, paragraph 45, as well as order of 22 March 2018, Centeno Meléndez, C‑315/17, not published, EU:C:2018:207, paragraph 65).</p>

            <p>In the present case, the Spanish Government relies on the difference between the context in which compensation, such as that provided for in Article 49(1)(c) of the Workers' Statute, is paid, when a fixed-term employment contract, such as the fixed-term relief contract, expires, and the context which calls for payment of the higher amount of compensation provided for in the event of dismissal on one of the grounds set out in Article 52 of that statute, such as economic or technical grounds or grounds relating to the employer's organisation or production when the number of posts lost is lower than that required in order to classify the termination of employment contracts as a `collective dismissal'. That government states, in essence, that while the Spanish legislator introduced the first form of compensation in order to prevent excessive recourse to temporary employment and to enhance employment stability, such compensation is paid when an event that could have been foreseen by the worker when he entered into the fixed-term employment contract occurs. Therefore, the purpose of that compensation is not, unlike the second form of compensation, to compensate for the frustration of a worker's legitimate expectation that his employment relationship would continue, as a result of his dismissal on one of the grounds set out in Article 52 of the statute. Such a difference explains why the level of compensation awarded to the worker on termination of his employment contract is not the same in both cases.</p>

            <p>In that respect, it should be noted that the payment of compensation such as that payable by Grupo Norte on termination of Mr Moreira Gómez's employment contract -- which was expected to occur, from the moment that contract was concluded, when the worker he replaced took full retirement -- takes place in a significantly different context, from a factual and legal point of view, to that in which the employment contract of a permanent worker is terminated on one of the grounds set out in Article 52 of the Workers' Statute.</p>

            <p>Indeed, it follows from the definition of `fixed-term contract' in Clause 3(1) of the Framework Agreement that a contract of that kind ceases to have any future effect on expiry of the term stipulated in the contract, that term being identified as the completion of a specific task, the occurrence of a specific event or, as in the present case, a specific date being reached. Thus, the parties to a fixed-term employment contract are aware, from the moment of its conclusion, of the date or event which determines its end. That term limits the duration of the employment relationship without the parties having to make their intentions known in that regard after entering into the contract.</p>

            <p>By contrast, the termination of a permanent employment contract on one of the grounds set out in Article 52 of the Workers' Statute, on the initiative of the employer, is the result of circumstances arising which were not foreseen at the date that contract was entered into and which disrupt the normal continuation of the employment relationship. As is clear from the Spanish Government's explanations set out in paragraph 55 above and as the Advocate General noted, in essence, in point 60 of her Opinion, it is precisely in order to compensate for the unforeseen nature of the termination of the employment relationship for such a reason and, accordingly, the frustration of any legitimate expectations the worker may have had at that date as regards the stability of that relationship, that Article 53(1)(b) of the Workers' Statute requires compensation equivalent to twenty days' remuneration per year of service to be paid to the dismissed worker.</p>

            <p>In the latter case, Spanish law does not treat fixed-term workers and comparable permanent workers differently, since Article 53(1)(b) of the Workers' Statute provides for statutory compensation equivalent to twenty days' remuneration per year of service with the employer to be paid to a worker, irrespective of whether their employment contract is for a fixed term or for an indefinite duration.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, it must be held that the fact that the respective compensation amounts provided for in Articles 49(1)(c) and 53(1)(b) of the Workers' Statute, which are paid in fundamentally different contexts, have different purposes constitutes an objective reason justifying the different treatment at issue.</p>

            <p>In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first and second questions is that Clause 4(1) of the Framework Agreement must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation under which the compensation paid to workers employed under fixed-term contracts entered into in order to cover working hours no longer covered as a result of a worker taking partial retirement, such as the relief contract at issue in the main proceedings, on expiry of the term for which those contracts were concluded, is less than the compensation awarded to permanent workers on termination of their employment contract on objective grounds.</p>

            <p>62 It is clear from the order for reference, in essence, that the third question is put only in the event that the first and second questions are answered in the affirmative. Given the answer to those first two questions, there is no need to answer the third.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules: Clause 4(1) of the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded on 18 March 1999, which is annexed to Council Directive 1999/70/EC of 28 June 1999 concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded by ETUC, UNICE and CEEP, must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation under which the compensation paid to workers employed under fixed-term contracts entered into in order to cover working hours no longer covered as a result of a worker taking partial retirement, such as the relief contract at issue in the main proceedings, on expiry of the term for which those contracts were concluded, is less than the compensation awarded to permanent workers on termination of their employment contract on objective grounds.</p>
