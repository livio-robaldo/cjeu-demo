Thus, by overstretching the scope of the derogation provision, the conservation system set up by the Directive would be compromised. The consequence would be that there cannot be any other satisfactory solution because none would equal the trapping of wild birds.</p>

The in-depth assessment in the strict sense, with the reasons, is set out exhaustively in the technical memorandum on the derogation envisaged for the live-capturing of seven species of finches of April 2014, originating from the Wild Bird Regulation Unit ( `the WBRU's technical memorandum'), which is part of the Ministry for the Environment, Sustainable Development and Climate Change.

            <p>contends that the Commission's understanding of the purpose of the Framework Regulations is incorrect. The fact that the seven species of finches are captured with a view to keeping them captive for recreational purposes does not prevent the capturing activity from also constituting a purpose in itself. The capturing and subsequent keeping in captivity are both an integral part of the tradition which the Maltese authorities seek to protect within the strict parameters of Article 9(l)(c) of Directive 2009/147. A captive breeding programme merely provides a partial solution for one of these activities, namely the keeping in captivity of specimens by bird fanciers for whom the capturing of those specimens is not necessarily of interest.</p>

Accordingly, the applicable national legislation must specify the criteria for the derogation clearly and precisely and require the authorities responsible for their application to take them into account. In respect of exceptional arrangements, which must be interpreted strictly and impose on the authority taking the decision the burden of proving that those conditions exist for each derogation, the Member States are required to ensure that all action affecting the protected species is authorised only on the basis of decisions containing a clear and sufficient statement of reasons which refers to the reasons, conditions and requirements laid down in Article 9(1) and (2) of that directive (see, to that effect, judgment of 8 June 2006, WWF Italia and Others, C‑60/05, EU:C:2006:378, paragraphs 33 and 34).</p>

As indicated in paragraphs 10 and 16 of the present judgment, Regulation 9 of the Conservation of Wild Birds Regulations transposes, in essence, Article 9 of Directive 2009/147, whereas Regulation 4 of the Framework Regulations requires the Minister to verify, when opening an Autumn finch live-capturing season, that there is no other satisfactory solution, within the meaning of Article 9(1) of Directive 2009/147. That finding cannot be called into question by the fact, raised by the Commission, that the Framework Regulations do not contain any reference to captive breeding and do not specifically require the Minister to assess whether captive breeding constitutes another satisfactory solution before authorising the trapping of finches for a specific season.</p>

            <p>First, the SMS tracking system is based on self-reporting by the licence holders and there is, therefore, a high risk that it may be abused. The highly questionable number of captured birds that was reported by means of the SMS system in the course of 2014 well illustrates that risk. Second, the</p>

            <p>Furthermore, several non-governmental organisations' reports on the 2014 trapping season have illustrated the inadequacy of that supervision. Those reports show widespread non-compliance with the derogation conditions, ranging from the use of illegal bird callers or the misuse of `single-use' rings to the trapping of species not covered by the derogation and the non-respect of restrictions relating to authorised times and places, in particular the widespread trapping inside `Natura 2000' sites.</p>

            <p>contends that it has enacted an enforcement and supervision regime of a rigour unprecedented within the EU. The use of the system making real time bag reporting mandatory by telephone made it possible to collect and check in real time any individual licence holder's catches as well as the uptake of individual bag limits, and to monitor the uptake of national quotas. An obligation was imposed on all licence holders to fit specially marked, single-use rings on every bird captured, immediately upon making a catch. The use of the rings is rigorously enforced during spot checks in the field. At the end of the season, unused rings must be returned to the authorities.</p>

            <p>states, finally, that, during the period of the derogation, the Maltese authorities routinely deployed a daily complement of over 50 officers in order to oversee compliance with the legal parameters. All the registered live capturing stations were inspected at some point during the derogation and 23% of all the individual licence holders were subject to a thorough spot check inspection.</p>

            <p>As regards, inter alia, the trapping of birds such as that at issue in these proceedings, that activity can be permitted, pursuant to Article 9(1)(c) of Directive 2009/147, only if it is, in particular, carried out under strictly supervised conditions (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 October 2003, Ligue pour la protection des oiseaux and Others, C‑182/02, EU:C:2003:558, paragraph 15).</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be noted that it is not disputed that 30 licence holders declared that they had reached the individual seasonal bag limit of ten finches on the last day of the season, a day on which the study of the migratory influx of the seven finch species in question, referred to in paragraph 70 of the present judgment, recorded the lowest migration levels of the season. In these circumstances, the accuracy of such statements seems uncertain.</p>

            <p>In the context of Malta, characterised by a very high density of licence holders, namely over 4000, and of registered trapping stations, namely over 6400, the fact that merely 23% of hunters have been subject to individual checks seems inadequate.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, it is apparent from Birdlife Malta's study of July 2015 that failure to observe the restrictions relating to authorised catch periods and locations, in particularly by trapping inside `Natura 2000' sites, has been rather frequent during the 2014 Autumn capturing season.</p>

            <p>According to that study, 41591 single-use rings were issued for the 2014 Autumn capturing season, bearing in mind that the catch limit for all seven finch species had been fixed at 26850 specimens. The system provided for and required licence holders to return unused rings. At the end of the season, 38602 rings remained in the possession of licence holders, that is 11752 more than the catch limit of 26850 birds and 31380 more than the 7222 finches whose capture had been declared during that season.</p>
