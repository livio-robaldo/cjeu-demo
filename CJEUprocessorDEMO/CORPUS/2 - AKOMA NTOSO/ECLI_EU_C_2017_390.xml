            <p>That applies to the concept of `establishment' within the meaning of Article 97(1) of Regulation No 207/2009, since that concept is not defined in that regulation and the regulation makes no reference to national laws for the purpose of determining its meaning.</p>

            <p>First of all, it should be noted that Regulation No 207/2009 provides, subject to the exceptions to which it expressly refers, for the application of Regulation No 44/2001 to proceedings relating to EU trade marks and applications for such trade marks, as is expressly stated in recital 16 and Articles 94 and 97(1) of Regulation No 207/2009.</p>

            <p>In that regard, although certain provisions of Regulation No 44/2001, such as Articles 5(5) and 18(2), also refer to the concept of `establishment', so that it cannot be ruled out that the guidance from the Court's case-law on those two provisions may to some extent be relevant for interpreting the concept of `establishment' within the meaning of Regulation No 207/2009, it cannot, however, be considered that that concept must necessarily bear the same meaning, whether it is used in one or the other of the two regulations.</p>

            <p>Thus, notwithstanding the principle that Regulation No 44/2001 applies to proceedings relating to an EU trade mark, the application of certain provisions of that regulation, in particular the rules in Articles 4 and 5(1), to proceedings in respect of the actions and claims referred to in Article 96 of Regulation No 207/2009 is excluded by Article 94(2) of that regulation. In the light of that exclusion, the jurisdiction of the EU trade mark courts laid down in Article 95(1) of Regulation No 207/2009 to hear the actions and claims referred to in Article 96 of that regulation results from rules directly provided for by that regulation, which have the character of lex specialis in relation to the rules provided for by Regulation No 44/2001 (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 June 2014, Coty Germany, C‑360/12, EU:C:2014:1318, paragraphs 26 and 27).</p>

            <p>In addition, Regulation No 44/2001, on the one hand, and Regulation No 207/2009, on the other, do not pursue the same objectives. Thus, according to recitals 12 and 13 of Regulation No 44/2001, that regulation aims to lay down, in addition to the defendant's domicile, alternative grounds of jurisdiction based on a close link between the court and the action, or in order to facilitate the sound administration of justice, or, in relation to insurance, consumer and employment contracts, to protect the weaker party by rules of jurisdiction more favourable to his interests than the general rules.</p>

            <p>Regulation No 207/2009 for its part aims, according to recitals 15 to 17, to strengthen the protection of EU trade marks, to prevent inconsistent decisions on the part of the courts and to ensure that the unitary character of those trade marks is not undermined, by means of decisions of EU trade mark courts which have effect and cover the entire area of the European Union.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, in order to determine the defining characteristics of the concept of `establishment' within the meaning of Article 97(1) of Regulation No 207/2009, it is necessary, in accordance with the Court's case-law set out in paragraph 22 above, to take account not only of the wording of that provision, but also of its context and objectives.</p>

            <p>The wording of Article 97(1) of Regulation No 207/2009 does not explain the concept of `establishment' for the purposes of its application. Nevertheless, it is apparent that a defendant who is not domiciled within the European Union is capable of having one or several establishments within the European Union, which a priori appears to suggest that, in such a case, actions may be brought before the courts of the various Member States where those establishments are located.</p>

            <p>As regards the context of which Article 97 of Regulation No 207/2009 forms part, that provision ensures that a court within the European Union always has jurisdiction to hear and determine cases concerning the infringement and validity of an EU trade mark. That article, which provides for several grounds of international jurisdiction, lists in paragraphs 1 to 4 the successive criteria for determining the Member State whose courts have jurisdiction, under Article 98(1)(a) of that regulation, in order to ensure effective protection of EU trade marks throughout the entire area of the European Union.</p>

Only if the defendant is not domiciled in and has no establishment in a Member State of the European Union does Article 97(2) and (3) provide, as an alternative, for jurisdiction to lie with the courts of the domicile or the establishment of the plaintiff and, as a further alternative, with the courts of the Member State where EUIPO has its seat.</p>

            <p>As the Advocate General stated in point 80 of his Opinion, Article 97(1) of Regulation No 207/2009, which provides that the courts of the Member State in which there is an establishment of a company which has no seat within the European Union are to have jurisdiction, far from being an exception to the basic rule of jurisdiction at the domicile of the defendant, which follows from Article 2(1) of Regulation No 44/2001 read in the light of recital 11 of the regulation, is, rather, an implementation of that principle, which suggests that that concept should be interpreted broadly.</p>

            <p>That jurisdictional rule is a general principle, which expresses the maxim actor sequitur forum rei, because it makes it easier, in principle, for a defendant to defend himself (see, to that effect, judgments of 13 July 2000, Group Josi, C‑412/98, EU:C:2000:399, paragraph 35, and of 19 February 2002, Besix, C‑256/00, EU:C:2002:99, paragraph 52). Such is the case, as the Advocate General stated in point 82 of his Opinion, where a party is required to defend itself before the courts of a Member State in which it has an establishment and with which it is therefore more closely linked.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, that interpretation does not undermine the objectives of the legislation on the EU trade mark, set out in paragraph 28 above, as the decisions of the EU trade mark courts with jurisdiction on the basis of Article 97 of Regulation No 207/2009 have effect and cover the entire area of the European Union.</p>

            <p>It follows from such a broad interpretation that there must be visible signs enabling the existence of an `establishment' within the meaning of Article 97(1) of Regulation No 207/2009 to be easily recognised. As the Advocate General stated in point 52 of his Opinion, the existence of an establishment thus requires a certain real and stable presence, from which commercial activity is pursued, as manifested by the presence of personnel and material equipment. In addition, that establishment must have the appearance of permanency to the outside world, such as the extension of a parent body (see, to that effect, judgments of 22 November 1978, Somafer, 33/78, EU:C:1978:205, paragraph 11; of 18 March 1981, Blanckaert &amp; Willems, 139/80, EU:C:1981:70, paragraph 12; of 9 December 1987, SAR Schotte, 218/86, EU:C:1987:536, paragraph 10; and of 19 July 2012, Mahamdia, C‑154/11, EU:C:2012:491, paragraph 48).</p>

            <p>In that regard, it is irrelevant whether the establishment on the territory of a Member State of an undertaking whose seat is outside the European Union has legal personality or not (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 December 2011, Voogsgeerd, C‑384/10, EU:C:2011:842, paragraph 54). Third parties must thus be able to rely on the appearance created by an establishment acting as an extension of the parent body (see, to that effect, judgment of 9 December 1987, SAR Schotte, 218/86, EU:C:1987:536, paragraph 15).</p>

            <p>The fact that an undertaking with its seat in a Member State before the courts of which an action is brought is a second-tier subsidiary of the undertaking whose seat is located outside of the European Union and not a direct subsidiary of that undertaking is also irrelevant, provided that the conditions set out in paragraph 37 above are satisfied.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, it is, in principle, irrelevant for the purposes of Article 97(1) of Regulation No 207/2009 whether the establishment thereby determined has participated in the alleged infringement. Such a requirement, which is not laid down in Article 97(1) of Regulation No 207/2009, would, in addition, not be reconcilable with the need for a broad interpretation of the concept of `establishment', set out in paragraph 34 above.</p>

            <p>Having regard to those considerations, the answer to the question referred is that Article 97(1) of Regulation No 207/2009 must be interpreted as meaning that a legally distinct second-tier subsidiary, with its seat in a Member State, of a parent body that has no seat in the European Union is an `establishment', within the meaning of that provision, of that parent body if the subsidiary is a centre of operations which, in the Member State where it is located, has a certain real and stable presence from which commercial activity is pursued, and has the appearance of permanency to the outside world, such as an extension of the parent body.</p>
