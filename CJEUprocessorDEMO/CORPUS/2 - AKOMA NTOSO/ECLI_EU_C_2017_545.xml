            <p>By application lodged on 18 April 2015 before the Tribunale amministrativo regionale per la Lombardia (Regional Administrative Court, Lombardy), Malpensa Logistica Europa, a concession company for airport areas intended for the performance of groundhandling activities at Malpensa Airport, sought the suspension and annulment of the measure granting that award.</p>

            <p>According to Malpensa Logistica Europa, that measure is vitiated by unlawfulness because it was adopted without any prior tendering procedure. In particular, that company argues that it had insufficient space at its disposal at the Malpensa Airport site to pursue its groundhandling activities. Accordingly, it was entitled to entertain the same expectations as Beta-Trans as regards the new areas to be allocated, and the decision by which SEA awarded the area in question, which was originally intended to be used as a hangar, directly to Beta-Trans, without any tendering procedure, caused it to suffer loss.</p>

            <p>SEA and Beta-Trans have argued before the referring court that the contested area was made available to Beta-Trans only temporarily, in order to enable it, as a new operator, to begin its activity as supplier of groundhandling services at Malpensa Airport pending completion of the fitting out of the areas allocated to Beta-Trans at the conclusion of a public tendering procedure in which Malpensa Logistica Europa had also participated. Moreover, according to SEA and Beta-Trans, Malpensa Logistica Europa already had at its disposal a storage area of approximately 18000 square metres, as well as two covered areas of 2700 and 3227 square metres, respectively, for the temporary storage of cargo where it could be protected in bad weather.</p>

            <p>With regard to the applicability of Directive 2004/17, the referring court considers that SEA, as manager of Malpensa Airport, is a contracting authority that is required to comply with public procurement rules in special sectors. Moreover, the activity pursued by SEA falls within the category of activities relating to the exploitation of a geographical area for the purpose of the provision of airports to air carriers, in accordance with Article 7 of Directive 2004/17. That court explains that, according to national case-law, the exploitation of airport areas (geographical areas), including, therefore, internal areas, in connection with the activities usually performed by air carriers falls within the material scope of the rules governing special sectors.</p>

            <p>However, according to the national court, the applicability of Directive 2004/17 might be at odds with the specific provisions of Legislative Decree No 18/1999, which transposed Directive 96/67. On the basis of that legislation, the requirement to launch a prior public tendering procedure is applicable only to the selection of suppliers falling within categories of groundhandling services whose access to the market is subject to restrictions and derogations.</p>

            <p>The referring court states in that regard that, according to the information available to it, those restrictions and derogations are not currently in force in so far as Malpensa Airport is concerned. As a consequence, it is necessary, according to that court, to accept the applicability of Article 4(1) of Legislative Decree No 18/1999, which grants free access by suppliers to the market for the provision of groundhandling services without the need for any prior public tendering procedure, provided that the space available at the airport is divided among the various suppliers of groundhandling services and self-handling airport users `to the extent necessary for the exercise of their rights and to allow effective and fair competition, on the basis of the relevant, objective, transparent and non-discriminatory rules and criteria', as required pursuant to Article 16(2) of Directive 96/67.</p>

            <p>In the light of the foregoing considerations, the Tribunale amministrativo regionale per la Lombardia (Regional Administrative Court, Lombardy) has decided to stay proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling: `Does Article 7 of Directive 2004/17, which requires the application of the EU rules governing the award of public contracts to activities relating to the exploitation of a geographical area for the purpose of the provision of airports to air carriers, as defined in the national case-law referred to in paragraphs 6.4 and 6.5 [of the order for reference], preclude national provisions, such as those set out in Articles 4 and 11 of Legislative Decree No 18/1999, which do not require a prior public selection procedure to be conducted for every allocation, including temporary allocations, of areas within airports for the purpose of such activities?'</p>

            <p>By its question, the referring court seeks to ascertain, in essence, whether Article 7 of Directive 2004/17 must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which does not require a selection procedure to be conducted prior to every allocation, including temporary allocations, of areas within airports to be used for the provision of groundhandling services.</p>
