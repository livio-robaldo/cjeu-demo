            <p>The workers were employed at the hospital in Dreieich-Langen (Germany), which was then owned by a local authority. Mr Felja was a caretaker/gardener from 1978, while Ms Graf was employed as a care assistant from 1986. In 1995, the local authority transferred the hospital to a limited liability company (GmbH), then, in 1997, the part of the hospital business where the workers were employed was transferred to KLS Facility Management GmbH ( `KLS FM').</p>

It argues that, after the transfer of the workers concerned to another employer, those agreements should be applied as they originally stood (statically), meaning that only the terms of employment agreed in the contract of employment concluded with the transferor employer, based on the collective agreements referred to by that contract may be relied on against the transferee employer.</p>

            <p>By its questions, which it is appropriate to answer together, the referring court asks essentially whether Article 3 of Directive 2001/23, read together with Article 16 of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of a transfer of a business, the continued observance of the rights and obligations of the transferor arising from a contract of employment, extends to the clause which the transferor and the worker agreed pursuant to the principle of freedom of contract, pursuant to which their employment relationship is governed not only by the collective agreement in force on the date of the transfer, but also by collective agreements subsequent to the transfer supplementing it, modifying it or replacing it, if national law provides for the possibility for the transferee to make adjustments, which are both consensual and unilateral.</p>

            <p>From the outset, it must be observed that, by means of contractual clauses, a contract of employment may refer to other legal instruments, in particular, collective labour agreements. Such clauses may, like `static' referral clauses, make reference solely to rights and obligations laid down by the text of the collective agreement in force on the date of the transfer of the business, or, like the `dynamic' referral clauses at issue in the main proceedings, may also refer to future modifications to the agreements, which involve changes to those rights and obligations.</p>

            <p>In that connection, the Court has held, in the case of a `static' contractual clause and in the context of Directive 77/187, that the latter does not in any way indicate that the EU legislature intended the transferee to be bound by collective labour agreements other than the one in force at the time of the transfer and, consequently, that the terms and conditions be subsequently amended through the application of a new collective labour agreement concluded after the transfer (see, to that effect, judgment of 9 March 2006, Werhof, C‑499/04, EU:C:2006:168, paragraph 29).</p>

          <content eId="para_6516__content">
            <p>The objective of Directive 77/187 was merely to safeguard the rights and obligations of employees in force on the day of the transfer. On the other hand, the Directive was not intended to protect mere expectations to rights and, therefore, hypothetical advantages flowing from future changes to collective agreements (see, to that effect, judgment of 9 March 2006, Werhof, C‑499/04, EU:C:2006:168, paragraph 29).</p>

          <content eId="para_6517__content">
            <p>While it follows from the case-law of the Court, referred to in the preceding paragraph of the present judgment, that Article 3 of Directive 2001/23 must be interpreted as meaning that it does not require a `static' clause to be treated as `dynamic', the Court also observed that a contract is characterised by the principle of freedom of the parties to arrange their own affairs, according to which, in particular, parties are free to enter into obligations with each other (judgment of 9 March 2006, Werhof, C‑499/04, EU:C:2006:168, paragraph 23).</p>

          <num>20</num>
          <content eId="para_6518__content">
            <p>Nothing in the wording of Directive 2001/23 and, in particular, Article 3 thereof, indicates that the EU legislature intended to derogate from that principle. It follows that Directive 2001/23 and, in particular Article 3 thereof, should not be read as intended to prevent, a `dynamic' clause from producing its effects under all circumstances.</p>

          <content eId="para_6519__content">
            <p>Therefore, if the transferor and the employees have freely consented to a `dynamic' contractual clause and if it is in force on the date of transfer, Directive 2001/23 and in particular Article 3 thereof, must be interpreted as providing, in principle, that that obligation arising from an employment contract is transferred to the transferee.</p>

            <p>However, the Court has stated, in the case of a `dynamic' contractual clause, that Directive 2001/23 does not aim solely to safeguard the interests of employees in the event of transfer of an undertaking, but seeks to ensure a fair balance between the interests of those employees, on the one hand, and those of the transferee, on the other. More particularly, it makes clear that the transferee must be in a position to make the adjustments and changes necessary to carry on its operations (see, to that effect, judgments of 18 July 2013, Alemo-Herron and Others, C‑426/11, EU:C:2013:521, paragraph 25 and of 11 September 2014, Österreichischer Gewerkschaftsbund, C‑328/13, EU:C:2014:2197, paragraph 29).</p>

            <p>More specifically, Article 3 of Directive 2001/23, read in the light of the freedom to conduct a business, requires that the transferee must be able to assert its interests effectively in a contractual process to which it is party and to negotiate the aspects determining changes in the working conditions of its employees with a view to its future economic activity (see, to that effect, judgment of 18 July 2013, Alemo-Herron and Others, C‑426/11, EU:C:2013:521, paragraph 33).</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is clear from the decision to refer and, in particular, from the wording of the questions referred for a preliminary ruling that the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings provides for the possibility, after the transfer, for the transferee to adjust the working conditions existing at the date of the transfer, either consensually or unilaterally.</p>

            <p>Having regard to all of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the questions referred is that Article 3 of Directive 2001/23, read together with Article 16 of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of a transfer of a business, the continued observance of the rights and obligations of the transferor arising from a contract of employment, extends to the clause which the transferor and the worker agreed pursuant to the principle of freedom of contract, pursuant to which their employment relationship is governed not only by the collective agreement in force on the date of the transfer, but also by agreements subsequent to the transfer and which supplement it, amend it or replace it, if the national law provides for the possibility for the transferee to make adjustments both consensually and unilaterally.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules: Article 3 of Council Directive 2001/23/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses and Article 16 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, must be interpreted as meaning that, in the case of a transfer of a business, the continued observance of the rights and obligations of the transferor arising from a contract of employment, extends to the clause which the transferor and the worker agreed pursuant to the principle of freedom of contract, pursuant to which their employment relationship is governed not only by the collective agreement in force on the date of the transfer, but also by agreements subsequent to the transfer and which supplement it, amend it or replace it, if the national law provides for the possibility for the transferee to make adjustments both consensually and unilaterally.</p>
