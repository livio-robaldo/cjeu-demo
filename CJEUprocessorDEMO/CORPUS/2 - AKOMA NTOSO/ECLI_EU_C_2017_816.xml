                <p>Without effective separation of networks from activities of generation and supply (effective unbundling), there is an inherent risk of discrimination not only in the operation of the network but also in the incentives for vertically integrated undertakings to invest adequately in their networks. ...</p>

                    <p>Only the removal of the incentive for vertically integrated undertakings to discriminate against competitors as regards network access and investment can ensure effective unbundling. Ownership unbundling, which implies the appointment of the network owner as the system operator and its independence from any supply and production interests, is clearly an effective and stable way to solve the inherent conflict of interests and to ensure security of supply. ...</p>

                    <p>Any system for unbundling should be effective in removing any conflict of interests between producers, suppliers and transmission system operators, in order to create incentives for the necessary investments and guarantee the access of new market entrants under a transparent and efficient regulatory regime and should not create an overly onerous regulatory regime for national regulatory authorities. ...</p>

                    <p>The setting up of a system operator or a transmission operator that is independent from supply and generation interests should enable a vertically integrated undertaking to maintain its ownership of network assets whilst ensuring effective separation of interests, provided that such independent system operator or such independent transmission operator performs all the functions of a system operator and detailed regulation and extensive regulatory control mechanisms are put in place.</p>

                <p>The full effectiveness of the independent system operator or independent transmission operator solutions should be ensured by way of specific additional rules. The rules on the independent transmission operator provide an appropriate regulatory framework to guarantee fair competition, sufficient investment, access for new market entrants and the integration of electricity markets. Effective unbundling through the independent transmission operator provisions should be based on a pillar of organisational measures and measures relating to the governance of transmission system operators and on a pillar of measures relating to investment, connecting new production capacities to the network and market integration through regional cooperation. The independence of the transmission operator should also, inter alia, be ensured through certain ``cooling-off '' periods during which no management or other relevant activity giving access to the same information as could have been obtained in a managerial position is exercised in the vertically integrated undertaking. ...'</p>

Consequently, where the questions submitted concern the interpretation of EU law, the Court is in principle bound to give a ruling (judgment of 22 September 2016, Microsoft Mobile Sales International and Others, C‑110/15, EU:C:2016:717, paragraph 18).</p>

            <p>First, as regards Articles 13 and 14 of Directive 2009/72, those provisions relate to cases in which the transmission system belonged to a vertically integrated undertaking on 3 September 2009 and the Member State concerned decided to designate an independent system operator on the basis of Article 9(8)(a) of the directive.</p>

            <p>It should be noted here that Article 10(2) of Directive 2009/72 provides that undertakings which own an electricity transmission system and have been certified by the national regulatory authority as having complied with the requirements of Article 9 of the directive are to be approved and designated as transmission system operators by the Member States.</p>

            <p>In the present case, however, the material submitted to the Court indicates that there is only one electricity transmission system in Bulgaria and that that system, which belonged to the vertically integrated undertaking Natsionalna elektricheska kompaniya on 3 September 2009, has since become the property of ESO.</p>

            <p>In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the fourth question is that Articles 9, 10, 13 and 14 of Directive 2009/72, Article 3 of Regulation No 714/2009, Article 2(3) in conjunction with recital 3 of Regulation No 1227/2011, and Article 1(3) of Regulation 2015/1222 do not preclude, in circumstances such as those of the main proceedings, national legislation limiting the number of holders of electricity transmission licences for a particular territory.</p>

              <p>Question 6</p>
            </tblock>
            <p>51 By its sixth question, the referring court essentially asks whether legislation of a Member State under which only one electricity transmission licence is granted within national territory restricts competition within the meaning of Articles 101 and 102 TFEU.</p>

          <content eId="para_2351__content">
            <p>In this respect, while it is true that Articles 101 and 102 TFEU are concerned solely with the conduct of undertakings and not with laws or regulations emanating from Member States, those articles, read in conjunction with Article 4(3) TEU, which lays down a duty of cooperation, nonetheless require Member States not to introduce or maintain in force measures, even of a legislative or regulatory nature, which may render ineffective the competition rules applicable to undertakings (judgment of 8 December 2016, Eurosaneamientos and Others, C‑532/15 and C‑538/15, EU:C:2016:932, paragraph 34).</p>

          <num>53</num>
          <content eId="para_2352__content">
            <p>In addition, Article 101 TFEU and Article 4(3) TEU are infringed where a Member State requires or encourages the adoption of agreements, decisions or concerted practices contrary to Article 101 TFEU or reinforces their effects, or where it divests its own rules of the character of legislation by delegating to private economic operators responsibility for taking decisions affecting the economic sphere (judgment of 8 December 2016, Eurosaneamientos and Others, C‑532/15 and C‑538/15, EU:C:2016:932, paragraph 35).</p>

          <num>54</num>
          <content eId="para_2353__content">
            <p>Furthermore, it follows from the Court's case-law that a Member State will be in breach of the prohibitions laid down by Articles 102 and 106(1) TFEU if an undertaking to which it grants special or exclusive rights is led, merely by exercising the rights conferred on it, to abuse its dominant position or where those rights are liable to create a situation in which the undertaking is led to commit such abuses. On the other hand, the mere creation of a dominant position through the grant of special or exclusive rights within the meaning of Article 106(1) TFEU is not in itself incompatible with Article 102 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 July 2015, Gullotta and Farmacia di Gullotta Davide &amp; C., C‑497/12, EU:C:2015:436, paragraph 23).</p>

            <p>In this context, in accordance with the Court's case-law which states that the Court may have to reformulate the questions referred to it so as to provide the national court with an answer which will be of use to it and enable it to determine the case before it (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 September 2013, Konstantinides, C‑475/11, EU:C:2013:542, paragraph 42), the sixth question referred should be understood as relating to Articles 101 and 102 TFEU read in conjunction with Article 4(3) TEU and Article 106(1) TFEU.</p>

            <p>However, the need to arrive at an interpretation of EU law which will be of use to the referring court requires that court to define the factual and legislative context of the questions it is asking, or at the very least to explain the factual circumstances on which those questions are based (judgment of 5 December 2013, Zentralbetriebsrat der gemeinnützigen Salzburger Landeskliniken, C‑514/12, EU:C:2013:799, paragraph 17). In the procedure established by Article 267 TFEU, the Court is empowered to give rulings on the interpretation of EU legislation only on the basis of the facts which the national court puts before it (judgment of 5 December 2013, Nordecon and Ramboll Eesti, C‑561/12, EU:C:2013:793, paragraph 28).</p>

            <p>According to the Court's case-law, that requirement to give details is of particular importance in the field of competition, which is characterised by complex factual and legal situations (order of 16 July 2015, Striani and Others, C‑299/15, not published, EU:C:2015:519, paragraph 25).</p>
