            <p>The Belgian Government contends that the present request for a preliminary ruling is inadmissible. In support of that plea of inadmissibility, the Belgian Government points out that Article 198(10) of the 1992 ITC authorises the Belgian tax authorities to reject, as non-deductible expenses, all interest paid by a parent company during the relevant tax year up to the amount of the dividends received from holdings in the capital of a subsidiary which have been held for less than one year and which benefit from the DBI deduction.</p>

            <p>In such circumstances, that government submits that that article is indeed similar to Article 4(2) of Directive 90/435, in that it provides a means of combating the abusive practice of borrowing in order to reduce the parent company's basis of assessment by generating deductible interest for the purpose of acquiring holdings in subsidiaries, which pay out dividends that are also deductible.</p>

            <p>However, according to the Belgian Government, in so far as Article 198(10) of the 1992 ITC has the indirect effect of neutralising the deduction, under Article 202 to 204 of the 1992 ITC, of dividends from short-term holdings, that article must be held to be covered by Article 3(2) of Directive 90/435, which allows Member States not to apply the profit-reducing scheme established by that directive to companies `which do not maintain for an uninterrupted period of at least two years holdings qualifying them as parent companies'. According to the Belgian Government, the consequence of that provision is that, in the circumstances to which it relates, Member States are not required to comply with Directive 90/435. Thus, it is of the opinion that Member States can not only refuse to grant the advantages set out in Article 4(1) of that directive, but also hold such charges to be non-deductible in circumstances that do not correspond to the provisions of Article 4(2) of that directive, or even to make use of a provision designed to prevent fraud or abuse within the meaning of Article 1(2) of that same directive that goes beyond what is necessary to prevent fraud or abuse.</p>

            <p>To that extent, the Belgian Government is of the opinion that Article 198(10) of the ITR 1992 relates to a situation that falls outside the scope of application of Directive 90/435.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be noted that the second indent of Article 3(2) of Directive 90/435 provides each Member State with the `option', by way of derogation from paragraph 1 of that article, of `not applying' that directive to companies of that Member State that do not maintain for an uninterrupted period of at least two years a holding qualifying them as parent companies or to those of their companies in which a company of another Member State does not maintain such a holding for an uninterrupted period of at least two years.</p>

            <p>According to its actual terms, that provision does not establish a general exception to the application of Directive 90/435, but merely provides an option for Member States, which is for those which wish to make use of it to implement in their national law. In that regard, it is necessary to note that, according to settled case-law of the Court, the provisions of a directive must be implemented with unquestionable binding force and with the specificity, precision and clarity necessary to satisfy the requirements of legal certainty (see judgment of 15 October 2015, Commission v Germany, C‑137/14, EU:C:2015:683, paragraph 51 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>That court states that the Belgian legislature initially transposed Directive 90/435 into national law by applying that directive in its entirety to national parent companies, without expressly requiring a company to hold for any minimum period the shares granting it the quality of parent company of the subsidiary that is the issuer of the shares and allowing it to seek the deduction of the dividends generated by those shares.</p>

            <p>Thus, according to that court, the Kingdom of Belgium did not exercise the option granted to Member States by the first part of the second indent of Article 3(2) of Directive 90/435 when it adopted the 1992 ITC.</p>

            <p>However, analysing in detail the preparatory documents, the object and the purpose of Article 198(10) of the 1992 ITC, the referring court takes the view that that provision implements in Belgian law Article 4(2) of Directive 90/435, since it seeks to prevent national parent companies from carrying out a double tax deduction through the acquisition, via deductible external financing, of shares in subsidiaries which also pay out dividends that are deductible.</p>

            <p>Consequently, the reason why Article 198(10) of the 1992 ITC provides no link between the acquisition of such shares and the financing of that transaction arises from the Belgian legislature's desire, not to neutralise the deduction of dividends resulting from short-term holdings by using the authorisation set out in the first part of the second indent of Article 3(2) of Directive 90/435, but to overcome the difficulty, from a practical point of view, for the tax authorities to check specifically the relationship between the financing of a transaction and the asset acquired, in the context of the implementation of the derogating rule envisaged by Article 4(2) of that directive.</p>

            <p>In addition, it should be noted that it is not for the Court, in the context of a request for a preliminary ruling, to give a ruling on the interpretation of provisions of domestic law and to decide whether the interpretation given by the national court of those provisions is correct. The Court must take account, under the division of jurisdiction between the European Union Courts and the national courts, of the factual and legislative context in which the questions put to it are set, as described in the order for reference (judgment of 23 April 2009, Angelidaki and Others, C‑378/07 to C‑380/07, EU:C:2009:250, paragraph 48 and the case-law cited).</p>

            </tblock>
            <p>42 By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 4(2) of Directive 90/435 precludes a provision of national law, such as Article 198(10) of the 1992 ITC, pursuant to which interest paid by a parent company under a loan is not deductible from the taxable profits of that parent company up to an amount equal to that of the dividends, which already benefit from tax deductibility, that are received from holdings of that parent company in the capital of its subsidiary companies that have been held for a period of less than one year, even if such interest does not relate to the financing of such holdings.</p>

            <p>In order to provide a useful answer to that question, it is necessary, according to settled case-law of the Court, to take account of the wording of Article 4(2) of Directive 90/435, as well as of the objectives and scheme of that directive (see, to that effect, judgments of 3 April 2008, Banque Fédérative du Crédit Mutuel, C‑27/07, EU:C:2008:195, paragraph 22; of 1 October 2009, Gaz de France -- Berliner Investissement, C‑247/08, EU:C:2009:600, paragraph 26, and of 8 March 2017, Wereldhave Belgium and Others, C‑448/15, EU:C:2017:180, paragraph 24).</p>

            <p>At the outset, it must be stated that the wording of Article 4(2) of Directive 90/435 is clear and unequivocal, so as to mean that that provision allows a Member State to preclude a parent company from deducting from its taxable profit only `charges relating to the holding' of that parent company in the capital of its subsidiary.</p>

            <p>It thus follows from the actual wording of that provision that it does not allow Member States to preclude parent companies from deducting interest paid in respect of all the loans of a parent company up to an amount equal to that of the profit generated by its holdings in its subsidiaries.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be recalled that Directive 90/435, as its third recital indicates, seeks, by the introduction of a common system of taxation, to eliminate any disadvantage to cooperation between companies of different Member States as compared with cooperation between companies of the same Member State and thereby to facilitate the grouping together of companies at EU level. That directive thus seeks to ensure the neutrality, in fiscal terms, of the distribution of profits by a subsidiary established in one Member State to its parent company established in another Member State (judgments of 1 October 2009, Gaz de France -- Berliner Investissement, C‑247/08, EU:C:2009:600 paragraph 27, and of 8 March 2017, Wereldhave Belgium and Others, C‑448/15, EU:C:2017:180, paragraph 25).</p>

            <p>Thus, the objective of that directive is to prevent double taxation of profits distributed by subsidiary companies to parent companies, through the mechanisms laid down in Article 4(1) and Article 5(1) of that directive, by ensuring that distributed profits are not taxed once at the subsidiary level and again at the parent-company level (see, to that effect, judgments of 3 April 2008, Banque Fédérative du Crédit Mutuel, C‑27/07, EU:C:2008:195, paragraph 27; of 12 February 2009, Cobelfret, C‑138/07, EU:C:2009:82, paragraph 29; of 1 October 2009, Gaz de France -- Berliner Investissement, C‑247/08, EU:C:2009:600, paragraph 57, and of 8 March 2017, Wereldhave Belgium and Others, C‑448/15, EU:C:2017:180, paragraph 36).</p>

          <content eId="para_2180__content">
            <p>With particular regard to Article 4(1) of Directive 90/435, that provision provides that, where a parent company, by virtue of its association with its subsidiary, receives distributed profits, the Member State of the parent company is required either to refrain from taxing such profits or to authorise the parent company to deduct from the amount of tax payable that fraction of the corporation tax paid by the subsidiary which relates to those profits and, if appropriate, the amount of the withholding tax levied by the Member State in which the subsidiary is resident, up to the limit of the amount of the corresponding domestic tax (judgments of 12 December 2006, Test Claimants in the FII Group Litigation, C‑446/04, EU:C:2006:774, paragraph 102; of 3 April 2008, Banque Fédérative du Crédit Mutuel, C‑27/07, EU:C:2008:195, paragraph 25, and of 8 March 2017, Wereldhave Belgium and Others, C‑448/15, EU:C:2017:180, paragraph 37).</p>

            <p>It is therefore by way of derogation that Article 4(2) of Directive 90/435 grants Member States the option of providing that charges relating to the holding and losses resulting from the distribution of the profits of the subsidiary may not be deducted from the taxable profits of the parent company.</p>

            <p>In that context, first, it should be pointed out that that provision must be interpreted strictly and therefore, according to settled case-law of the Court, cannot be given an interpretation going beyond its actual words (see, to that effect, judgments of 17 October 1996, Denkavit and Others, C‑283/94, C‑291/94 and C‑292/94, EU:C:1996:387, paragraph 27, and of 25 September 2003, Océ Van der Grinten, C‑58/01, EU:C:2003:495, paragraph 86).</p>

            <p>Second, it must be held that the rule established in Article 4(2) of Directive 90/435 would negate the effectiveness of the rule set out in Article 4(1) of that directive if that first rule had to be interpreted as allowing Member States to preclude the deduction, from the taxable profits of a parent company, of all interest charged in respect of loans up to an amount equal to the amount of dividends, which benefit from a tax exoneration, that the parent company receives from its holding in the capital of a subsidiary, without that non-deductibility being limited to interest charges relating to the financing of that holding which pays out those dividends. Such an interpretation would equate to allowing those Member States to increase indirectly the taxable profits of a parent company, thereby affecting the neutrality, from the tax point of view, of the distribution of dividends paid by a subsidiary located in one Member State to its parent company established another Member State.</p>

            <p>Finally, only a literal interpretation of the rule in Article 4(2) of Directive 90/435, set out in paragraphs 44 and 45 of the present judgment, is compatible with the specific objective referred to in that provision in the context of the scheme of Directive 90/435.</p>

          <content eId="para_2185__content">
            <p>The option granted to Member States by that provision seeks to prevent a parent company from benefiting from a double tax advantage arising, first, from profits that are tax-exempt pursuant to the first indent of Article 4(1) of Directive 90/435 and, second, from the tax reduction by means of the deduction by virtue of charges relating to holding losses resulting from the distribution of such profits (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 December 2008, Les Vergers du Vieux Tauves, C‑48/07, EU:C:2008:758, paragraph 42).</p>

          <content eId="para_2186__content">
            <p>From that point of view, Article 4(2) of Directive 90/435 must necessarily be interpreted as allowing Member States only to prevent a parent company from benefiting from the double tax advantage referred to in the preceding paragraph. Permitting Member States to refuse to allow parent companies to deduct interest that is not linked to the acquisition of holdings on which tax-free dividends have been paid out would manifestly go beyond what is necessary to achieve such an objective.</p>

          <num>56</num>

            <p>It follows that a domestic provision, such as Article 198(10) of the 1992 ITC, that excludes, generally and automatically, tax deductibility, as business expenses or charges, of interest relating to loans taken out by a parent company up to an amount equal to the amount of dividends paid out by a holding of that parent company in the capital of a subsidiary, that already benefit from tax deductibility, even if the payment of that interest does not relate to the financing of the acquisition of that holding, is not a compliant implementation of the derogating rule set out in Article 4(2) of Directive 90/435.</p>

            <p>Having regard to all of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question is that Article 4(2) of Directive 90/435 must be interpreted as precluding a provision of domestic law, such as Article 198(10) of the 1992 ITC, pursuant to which interest paid by a parent company under a loan is not deductible from the taxable profits of that parent company up to an amount equal to that of the dividends, which already benefit from tax deductibility, that are received from the holdings of that parent company in the capital of its subsidiary companies that have been held for a period of less than one year, even if such interest does not relate to the financing of such holdings.</p>

            </tblock>
            <p>58 By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 1(2) of Directive 90/435 must be interpreted as allowing Member States to apply a domestic provision, such as Article 198(10) of the 1992 ITC.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be noted that Article 1(2) of Directive 90/435 provides that that directive does not preclude the application of domestic or agreement-based provisions required for the prevention of fraud and abuse.</p>

            <p>As the Advocate General has observed in point 51 of her Opinion, Article 1(2) of Directive 90/435 reflects the general EU law principle that abuse of rights is prohibited (judgment of 5 July 2007, Kofoed, C‑321/05, EU:C:2007:408, paragraph 38), and that EU law therefore cannot be relied on for abusive or fraudulent ends (see, inter alia, to that effect, judgments of 21 February 2006, Halifax and Others, C‑255/02, EU:C:2006:121, paragraph 69, and of 28 July 2016, Kratzer, C‑423/15, EU:C:2016:604, paragraph 37).</p>

            <p>Nonetheless, it must be noted that, as the Advocate General also made clear in point 52 of her Opinion, Article 1(2) of Directive 90/435 is a provision of principle, the content of which is explained in detail in other provisions of that directive, inter alia in Article 4(2), in that it seeks in particular to counteract abuse by parent companies resulting from a double tax deduction (see, by analogy, judgment of 17 October 1996, Denkavit and Others, C‑283/94, C‑291/94 and C‑292/94, EU:C:1996:387, paragraph 31).</p>

            <p>It is apparent from the answer given to the first question that a domestic provision, such as Article 198(10) of the 1992 ITC, is contrary to Article 4(2) of Directive 90/435 in that it goes beyond the measures that the EU legislature held to be appropriate to avoid the abuse by parent companies resulting from the possibility of carrying out a double tax deduction.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fifth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 4(2) of Council Directive 90/435/EEC of 23 July 1990 on the common system of taxation applicable in the case of parent companies and subsidiaries of different Member States must be interpreted as precluding a provision of domestic law, such as Article 198(10) of the 1992 Income Tax Code, coordinated by the Royal Decree of 10 April 1992 and confirmed by the Law of 12 June 1992, pursuant to which interest paid by a parent company under a loan is not deductible from the taxable profits of that parent company up to an amount equal to that of the dividends, which already benefit from tax deductibility, that are received from the holdings of that parent company in the capital of its subsidiary companies that have been held for a period of less than one year, even if such interest does not relate to the financing of such holdings. 2. Article 1(2) of Directive 90/435 must be interpreted as not authorising Member States to apply a domestic provision, such as Article 198(10) of the 1992 Income Tax Code, coordinated by the Royal Decree of 10 April 1992 and confirmed by the Law of 12 June 1992, to the extent that that provision goes beyond what is necessary for the prevention of fraud and abuse.</p>
