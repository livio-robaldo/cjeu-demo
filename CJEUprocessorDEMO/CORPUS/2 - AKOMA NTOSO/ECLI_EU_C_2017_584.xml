            <p>In the statements of reasons relating to those acts, the Council described Hamas as a terrorist group and referred to a number of terrorist acts which Hamas is said to have carried out from 2005 onwards. In addition, the Council referred, in particular, to a decision adopted in 2001 by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and two decisions adopted in the same year by the authorities of the United States of America. The United Kingdom decision is a decision of the Secretary of State for the Home Department proscribing Hamas, which is considered to be an organisation involved in acts of terrorism. The decisions of the authorities of the United States consist in a government decision designating Hamas as a foreign terrorist organisation, pursuant to section 219 of the US Immigration and Nationality Act, and a decision designating Hamas as an entity expressly identified as an international terrorist entity, pursuant to Executive Order 13224 (together `the decisions of the United States authorities'). Having found that the aforementioned decision of the United Kingdom was reviewed regularly by an internal government committee and that the decisions of the United States authorities were subject to both administrative and judicial review, the Council considered that those decisions had been adopted by competent authorities, for the purposes of Article 1(4) of Common Position 2001/931. Lastly, the Council noted that those decisions still remained in force and indicated that the reasons for including Hamas on the list at issue remained valid.</p>

            <p>By an application lodged at the General Court Registry on 12 September 2010, Hamas brought an action for annulment of Decision 2010/386 and Implementing Regulation No 610/2010. Those measures were repealed and replaced, successively, by the Council measures of January, July and December 2011, June and December 2012, July 2013 and February and July 2014 mentioned in paragraph 1 of the present judgment, and Hamas therefore successively modified the form of order initially sought, so as to ensure that its action covers the annulment of those measures also, in so far as they concern Hamas.</p>

In support of its application for annulment of the measures adopted by the Council in the period from July 2011 to July 2014 and mentioned in paragraph 1 of the present judgment (together `the measures adopted by the Council in the period from July 2011 to July 2014'), Hamas put forward eight pleas in law, alleging, respectively, infringement of Article 1(4) of Common Position 2001/931; errors as to the accuracy of the facts; an error of assessment as to the terrorist nature of that entity; failure to take sufficient account of the development of the situation `owing to the passage of time'; breach of the principle of non-interference; breach of the obligation to state reasons; breach of its rights of defence and of the right to effective judicial protection; and breach of the right to property.</p>

            <p>By its first ground of appeal, which relates in particular to paragraphs 101, 103, 109 to 111, 121, 125 to 127 and 141 of the judgment under appeal, the Council submits, first, that that judgment is based on the mistaken premiss that the Council must regularly provide new reasons for retaining Hamas on the list at issue. In the absence of any annulment or withdrawal of the national decisions on which the initial entry of Hamas on that list was based, and in the absence of other material that might support the withdrawal of Hamas from that list, the Council was, it claims, entitled to maintain Hamas on the list at issue solely on the basis of the national decisions that justified that entity's initial listing.</p>

            <p>Second, the Council maintains that the General Court was wrong to reject the use of open source material for the purposes of periodic reviews. The Council contends that it must be able to rely to that end on material other than national decisions, since in many cases there are no national decisions taken after the initial entry of a person or entity on the list at issue. The General Court's reasoning is, it argues, contrary to the objective of combating terrorism to which Common Position 2001/931 refers.</p>

            <p>By contrast, according to Hamas, the Council is wrong to claim that it could have maintained Hamas on the list at issue solely on the basis of the national decisions that justified its initial entry on that list. The Council's assertion that the General Court wrongly ruled out the use of open source information falls foul of Article 1(4) of Common Position 2001/931, as interpreted by the Court in the judgment of 15 November 2012, Al-Aqsa v Council and Netherlands v Al-Aqsa ( C‑539/10 P and C‑550/10 P, EU:C:2012:711), which requires, in order to guarantee the protection of the persons or entities concerned and in the absence of the European Union's own means of investigation, that the restrictive measures imposed by the Union be based on material actually examined and accepted in decisions of national competent authorities. Hamas argues that that requirement applies, given the seriousness of the impact of restrictive measures on the persons or entities concerned, also to the reviews prescribed in Article 1(6) of Common Position 2001/931.</p>

In order to determine those conditions, it is necessary to interpret Article 1(6) of Common Position 2001/931, taking into account in particular its relationship with Article 1(4), which governs the conditions for the initial listing of the person or entity concerned.</p>

That requirement seeks to ensure that, in the absence of any means at the disposal of the Union to carry out its own investigations regarding the involvement of a person or entity in terrorist acts, the Council's decision on the initial listing is taken on a sufficient factual basis enabling the Council to conclude that there is a danger that, if preventive measures are not taken, the person or entity concerned may continue to be involved in terrorist activities (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 November 2012, Al-Aqsa v Council and Netherlands v Al-Aqsa, C‑539/10 P and C‑550/10 P, EU:C:2012:711, paragraphs 69, 79 and 81).</p>

In paragraphs 110 and 127 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court held that the reference to any new terrorist act which the Council inserts in its statement of reasons during a review pursuant to Article 1(6) of Common Position 2001/931 must have been the subject of an examination and a national decision by a competent authority. Having found, notably in paragraphs 109 and 131 of the judgment under appeal, that the Council had based its allegations concerning terrorist acts which Hamas is said to have committed from 2005 onwards not on such decisions but on information which it obtained from the press and the internet, the General Court accordingly annulled the acts at issue. -- The first part of the first ground of appeal</p>

By imposing such a requirement, the General Court transposed the condition concerning the existence of such a decision, which is laid down in Article 1(4) of Common Position 2001/931 solely in relation to the initial entry of a person or entity on that list, to the reviews which the Council is required to carry out under Article 1(6) of that common position.

The General Court's finding of an infringement of the obligation to state reasons is thus the direct consequence of the finding of an infringement of Article 1 of Common Position 2001/931, in respect of which it has been established that it is vitiated by an error of law.</p>

            <p>Consequently, the General Court's error of law in connection with its interpretation of Article 1 has the effect that its finding of an infringement by the Council of the obligation to state reasons is also vitiated by an error of law.</p>

            <p>Since the General Court has ruled only on the fourth and sixth pleas in law in the application made by Hamas for annulment of the measures adopted by the Council in the period from July 2011 to July 2014, and the other pleas in law relied on before the General Court raise in part questions relating to the assessment of facts, the Court considers that the state of the proceedings is not such as to permit final judgment to be given in the action, and that the case must be referred back to the General Court and the costs reserved.</p>
