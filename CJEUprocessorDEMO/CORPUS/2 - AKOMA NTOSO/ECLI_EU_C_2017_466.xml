            <p>In the context of the implementation of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1390 (2002), the appellants were made subject to restrictive measures freezing their funds and other financial assets, adopted pursuant to Council Regulation (EC) No 881/2002 of 27 May 2002 imposing certain specific restrictive measures directed against certain persons and entities associated with Usama bin Laden, the Al-Qaida network and the Taliban, and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 467/2001 prohibiting the export of certain goods and services to Afghanistan, strengthening the flight ban and extending the freeze of funds and other financial resources in respect of the Taliban of Afghanistan ( OJ 2002 L 139, p. 9). That regulation had been adopted in order to implement Article 3 of Council Common Position 2002/402/CFSP of 27 May 2002 concerning restrictive measures against Usama bin Laden, members of the Al-Qaida organisation and the Taliban and other individuals, groups, undertakings and entities associated with them and repealing Common Positions 96/746/CFSP, 1999/727/CFSP, 2001/154/CFSP and 2001/771/CFSP ( OJ 2002 L 139, p. 4).</p>

Regulation No 246/2006 had been adopted following a decision of the United Nations Sanctions Committee ( `the Sanctions Committee') of 7 February 2006 to amend the list -- drawn up under Resolution 1390 (2002) -- of persons, groups and entities to whom the freezing of funds and economic resources should apply, by including in that list, inter alia, the names of the appellants.</p>

            <p>The General Court held, in paragraph 46 of the judgment under appeal, that there was no longer any need to adjudicate on the action brought in respect of Regulation No 1138/2010, by which Sanabel Relief Agency had been re-listed, since, according to a letter from the United Kingdom authorities of 26 September 2013, Sanabel Relief Agency no longer had any existence in law and, as a result, no longer had the capacity to bring legal proceedings.</p>

It found, in paragraphs 47 to 51 of the judgment under appeal, that those three individuals still had a legal interest in bringing proceedings for annulment of that regulation, notwithstanding the subsequent removal of their names from that list by Implementing Regulation No 640/2011. It nevertheless rejected the three pleas in law concerning them, relating, respectively, to procedural irregularity in the review conducted by the Commission, breach of the obligation to state reasons as required by Article 296 TFEU, and breach of the right to property and of the right to respect for private life.</p>

            <p>In the appellants' submission, the General Court was not entitled to rely in that regard on Article 78 of its Rules of Procedure and the letter from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland of 26 September 2013 indicating that Sanabel Relief Agency no longer existed in law since it had not been included on the United Kingdom's Companies House register since 2007 and had been removed from the United Kingdom's Charity Commission register on 28 January 2012.</p>

            <p>Second, and in essence, they argue that the legal personality of an entity is neither conferred nor lost by its registration on or removal from the United Kingdom's Companies House or Charity Commission registers. If it were otherwise, Sanabel Relief Agency would not have had legal personality to apply for its removal from the list at issue from 2007. In any event, they claim that neither the factual basis on which the United Kingdom's Charity Commission removed Sanabel Relief Agency from its register nor the reasons for that removal are apparent from the removal decision of 28 January 2012.</p>

            <p>They also note that, by stating in paragraph 45 of the judgment under appeal that Sanabel Relief Agency has not been subject to restrictive measures since 17 October 2013, the General Court seems to have adopted an entirely different legal basis for its decision not to accept that Sanabel Relief Agency has the capacity to maintain legal proceedings. It thus considered that the case-law derived from the judgment of 18 January 2007, PKK and KNK v Council ( C‑229/05 P, EU:C:2007:32), according to which an entity must be accepted as existing in law in so far as it is subject to restrictive measures, did not apply to a charitable body like Sanabel Relief Agency, since that body had not been subject to restrictive measures since 17 October 2013. They also submit that the General Court should have asked Sanabel Relief Agency to establish its legal interest, since it had asked the natural persons among the appellants to do so.</p>

They emphasise that they relied in that regard on a key fact, namely that, at the time of their re-listing, the United Kingdom -- the Member State responsible for their inclusion on the lists of persons subject to fund-freezing measures -- was of the view that they no longer satisfied the listing criteria. They make clear that they had indicated, in paragraph 94 of their application initiating the proceedings, that that material demonstrated that the Commission had failed to establish to any relevant standard of proof that they satisfied the criteria under Resolution 1617 (2005), and therefore that the interference with their rights was necessarily disproportionate.</p>

            <p>The Council contends, principally, that the appellants' second ground of appeal is imprecise and confuses considerations pertaining to the procedural legality of the acts at issue -- in particular the obligation to state reasons, an essential procedural requirement -- and their substantive legality, concerning the question whether the grounds for listing are well founded. This ground of appeal does not, therefore, satisfy the formal requirements set out in Article 169(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice and should be rejected as manifestly inadmissible. In the alternative, the Council submits that, by this ground of appeal, the appellants are merely reformulating the first ground of appeal, concerning the substantive challenge to the statements of reasons on which the Commission based the appellants' re-listing, and that it should therefore, in any event, be rejected for the same reasons as those set out in the examination of the first ground of appeal.</p>

            <p>It is the Commission's contention that this ground of appeal, which concerns paragraphs 78 and 79 of the judgment under appeal, in which the General Court found that Regulation No 1139/2010 was not vitiated by any infringement of the obligation to state reasons, is manifestly unfounded. The General Court applied precisely the legal test set out in the judgment of 18 July 2013, Commission and Others v Kadi ( C‑584/10 P, C‑593/10 P and C‑595/10 P, EU:C:2013:518, paragraph 118), which requires that the statement of reasons identify the individual, specific and concrete reasons why the competent authorities consider that a particular person must be subject to restrictive measures. The Commission adds that paragraphs 120 and 121 of the latter judgment do not relate to the obligation to state reasons but to the substantive assessment of the reasons given, and thus that `the appellants' arguments ... are misdirected'.</p>

            <p>As is evident from paragraphs 78 and 79 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court stated that Regulation No 1139/2010 referred to the communication to the appellants of the statements of reasons and to the observations which the appellants were able to submit in that regard, and, moreover, assessed the reasons given in those statements, finding in this instance that they conformed to the requirements stemming from the judgment of 18 July 2013, Commission and Others v Kadi ( C‑584/10 P, C‑593/10 P and C‑595/10 P, EU:C:2013:518, paragraph 116), since they contained the individual, specific and concrete reasons for placing the appellants' names on the list at issue.</p>

            <p>By their third ground of appeal, the appellants submit that the General Court wrongly found that the Commission had conducted a careful, impartial and independent analysis for itself of the facts relied on in the statement of reasons for the acts at issue and of the exculpatory material and observations they had produced. They state, in that regard, that the General Court appears to have overlooked the written observations and oral submissions which they presented in the course of the proceedings, since it did not address any of the arguments they had put forward.</p>

            <p>In their submission, at the time when the acts at issue were adopted, the Commission simply gave the appearance of reviewing the file. In essence, it observed only in the most formal sense the appellants' rights of defence, and did not envisage calling into question the Sanctions Committee's findings in the light of their observations, conduct which the General Court had already had occasion to condemn in its judgment of 30 September 2010, Kadi v Commission ( T‑85/09, EU:T:2010:418, paragraph 71), and subsequently in its judgments of 21 March 2014, Yusef v Commission ( T‑306/10, EU:T:2014:141, paragraphs 103 and 104), and of 14 April 2015, Ayadi v Commission ( T‑527/09 RENV, not published, EU:T:2015:205, paragraphs 72 and 73). They submit that the fact that the Commission made no approach to the United Kingdom -- although that was the Member State responsible for their inclusion on the lists of persons subject to fund-freezing measures and it no longer supported their re-listing when the acts at issue were adopted -- is evidence of that conduct.</p>

            <p>According to the appellants, the General Court merely noted, in paragraphs 66 and 67 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had `reviewed' the grounds for the listings on 16 April 2010 and corresponded with the Sanctions Committee on 27 May, 14 September and 26 October 2010. There is nothing, however, that might establish that the Commission actually carried out an assessment of the exculpatory material and as to whether the alleged reasons were well founded. Simply communicating the appellants' observations to the Sanctions Committee on 27 May 2010 and then asking for reasons as to why the appellants had not been removed from the list at issue is not evidence of the Commission having evaluated the material held by the United Kingdom authorities for itself. The General Court had thus, in paragraphs 66 to 70 of the judgment under appeal, maintained an `irrational' view of the facts.</p>

            <p>The Council contends that the appellants' third ground of appeal relates to findings of fact made by the General Court and must therefore be rejected as inadmissible. It submits that, on the basis of the process of review followed by the Commission, the General Court did not distort any facts presented under the first and second pleas raised by the appellants in the proceedings at first instance. They had not, according to the Council, provided sufficient material in the course of the present appeal to demonstrate that the General Court manifestly distorted the evidence in respect of the facts related to the procedure followed by the Commission, which had complied with the principles set out in the judgment of 18 July 2013, Commission and Others v Kadi ( C‑584/10 P, C‑593/10 P and C‑595/10 P, EU:C:2013:518).</p>

            <p>The Commission also contends that the appellants, who, it claims, are in essence asking the Court to reassess the evidence and the facts underpinning their entry on the list at issue, have not identified any particular document which shows the General Court's findings to be substantially incorrect or demonstrates that the General Court distorted the clear sense of the evidence before it, and concludes that their third ground of appeal should therefore be declared inadmissible.</p>

            <p>It also states that the three very general arguments put forward by the appellants in support of their claim that the General Court took an irrational view of the facts are unfounded. First of all, the assertion that the ground set out in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal is unsubstantiated is untenable, the General Court having correctly found that the Commission had carried out a careful, independent and critical review of the appellants' observations and of their entry on the list of persons subject to restrictive measures that was decided upon by the Sanctions Committee, and, moreover, that it had not automatically reproduced that committee's conclusions. Next, in the Commission's submission, the appellants' arguments that the grounds set out in paragraphs 66 to 70 of the judgment under appeal are incompatible with the judgments of 18 July 2013, Commission and Others v Kadi ( C‑584/10 P, C‑593/10 P and C‑595/10 P, EU:C:2013:518); of 21 March 2014, Yusef v Commission ( T‑306/10, EU:T:2014:141); and of 14 April 2015, Ayadi v Commission ( T‑527/09 RENV, not published, EU:T:2015:205) are unfounded, since the question as to whether there is an infringement of the rights of the defence and of the right to effective judicial protection must be examined in relation to the specific circumstances of each particular case. Lastly, the argument that paragraphs 66 to 70 of the judgment under appeal are vitiated by an error of law because no approach was made to the United Kingdom at all, at any time, is unfounded. It does not follow from that case-law that the Commission is obliged to approach the United Kingdom. In any event, the Commission had consulted the EU Committee for the review of listings, on which all the Member States are represented.</p>
