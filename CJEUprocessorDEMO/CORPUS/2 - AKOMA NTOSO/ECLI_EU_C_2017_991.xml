According to the Commission, a name registered as a PDO or PGI may legitimately be included in the list of ingredients of a foodstuff. 2. The Commission also considers that a name registered as a PDO or PGI may be mentioned in or close to the trade name of a foodstuff incorporating products benefiting from a registered name, as well as in the labelling, presentation and advertising relating to that foodstuff, provided that the following conditions are met.</p>

                <p>The foodstuff in question should not contain any other ``comparable ingredient '', i.e. any other ingredient which may partially or totally replace the ingredient benefiting from a PDO or PGI.

However, given the wide range of possible scenarios, the Commission is not able to suggest a minimum percentage to be uniformly applied. As an example, the incorporation of a minimum amount of a spice benefiting from a PDO/PGI in a foodstuff could, if appropriate, be sufficient to confer an essential characteristic on that foodstuff. By contrast, the incorporation of a minimum amount of meat benefiting from a PDO/PGI in a foodstuff would not a priori be sufficient to confer an essential characteristic on a foodstuff.</p>

            <p>At the end of 2012, Aldi, a company distributing, inter alia, foodstuffs, began to sell a frozen product manufactured by Galana NV, intervener in the main proceedings in support of Aldi. That product was distributed under the name `Champagner Sorbet' and contained, among its ingredients, 12% champagne.</p>

            <p>Taking the view that the distribution of that product under that name constituted an infringement of the PDO `Champagne', the CIVC, an association of champagne producers, brought proceedings before the Landgericht München I (Regional Court, Munich I, Germany) in order to obtain an injunction, on the basis of Article 118m of Regulation No 1234/2007 and Article 103 of Regulation No 1308/2013, prohibiting Aldi from using that name on the frozen goods market. The decision of that court, which granted the application, was reversed on appeal by decision of the Oberlandesgericht München (Higher Regional Court, Munich, Germany), which dismissed the application.</p>

            <p>The appeal court considers, in particular, that the conditions for bringing an action under Article 103(2)(a)(ii), (b) and (c) of Regulation No 1308/2013 were not satisfied, as the condition requiring unfair use of a PDO was not met in the present case, Aldi had a legitimate interest in using the name `Champagner Sorbet' to refer to a food product known to the public under that name and in which champagne was an essential ingredient, and there was no misleading indication.</p>

            <p>The CIVC then lodged an appeal on a point of law before the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice, Germany), which states, in the first place, that it is inclined to take the view that Aldi's use of the name `Champagner Sorbet' falls within the scope of Article 118m(2)(a)(ii) of Regulation No 1234/2007 and Article 103(2)(a)(ii) of Regulation No 1308/2013 because Aldi uses that name for a frozen dessert and, therefore, for a product that does not correspond to the product specifications for wines protected by the PDO `Champagne' and uses that PDO for commercial purposes.</p>

            <p>In the second place, the referring court considers that the name `Champagner Sorbet' is likely to extend the reputation of the PDO `Champagne' to the product distributed by Aldi. It is nonetheless uncertain whether the use of a PDO constitutes exploitation of the reputation of the PDO, within the meaning of the provisions cited above, where the name of the foodstuff corresponds to the name by which the relevant public usually refers to that foodstuff and the ingredient has been added in sufficient quantity to confer on the foodstuff one of its essential characteristics. Like the appeal court, the Bundesgerichtshof considers that where there is a legitimate interest in the use of the PDO, there cannot be exploitation of the reputation of the PDO.</p>

It considers in that regard that those provisions require disputed use of a PDO to be unlawful and that, where use is justified by a legitimate interest, such use therefore falls outside the prohibitions laid down by those provisions.</p>

In order to determine whether it undermines the protection afforded by Article 118m(2)(a)(ii) of Regulation No 1234/2007 and Article 103(2)(a)(ii) of Regulation No 1308/2013, it is therefore necessary to examine whether such use constitutes a means of taking unfair advantage of the reputation of that PDO.</p>

            <p>It should be noted in that regard, first, that Article 3(1) and Article 5(1) of Directive 2000/13, which was in force at the material time, and, as observed by the referring court, Article 9(1)(a) and Article 17(1) of Regulation No 1169/2011 do not, in any case, require the PDO to be included in the name of a foodstuff which does not correspond to the product specifications for that PDO but which contains an ingredient that does correspond to those specifications, where the use of such a name would be at odds with the protection afforded by Article 118m(2)(a)(ii) of Regulation No 1234/2007 and Article 103(2)(a)(ii) of Regulation No 1308/2013.</p>

            <p>Lastly, the Guidelines, which, according to recital 32 of Regulation No 1151/2012, must be taken into account where products protected as a PDO or PGI are used as ingredients, state, in Section 2.1.2 thereof, that a name registered as a PDO may be mentioned in the trade name of a foodstuff incorporating products benefiting from a registered name provided three conditions, set out in that section, are met. Given that that regulation seeks, as indicated in paragraph 33 above, to ensure a high level of protection and to align that protection with that which applies to the wine sector, the Guidelines are also relevant for the purposes of interpreting Article 118m(2)(a)(ii) of Regulation No 1234/2007 and Article 103(2)(a)(ii) of Regulation No 1308/2013.</p>

As a consequence, it is for the national courts to determine, in the light of the particular circumstances of each individual case, whether such use is intended to take unfair advantage of the reputation of a PDO.</p>

            <p>As the purpose of protecting registered names and geographical indications is, inter alia, as indicated in paragraph 38 above, to assure consumers that products bearing such an indication have, because of their provenance from a particular geographical area, certain specific characteristics and offer a guarantee of quality due to their geographical provenance, that purpose would not be achieved if it were possible for a PDO to be or become a generic name. Thus, under Article 118k(1) of Regulation No 1234/2007 and Article 101(1) of Regulation No 1308/2013, names which have become generic are not protected as PDOs. Moreover, Article 118m(3) of Regulation No 1234/2007 and Article 103(3) of Regulation No 1308/2013 provided that PDOs cannot become generic in the European Union. To take the view that the fact that the name of a foodstuff, such as `Champagner Sorbet', is the name commonly used by the relevant public to refer to that foodstuff may be relevant when determining whether the use of a PDO as part of that name is unfair would be tantamount to accepting that that PDO may be used generically and would therefore be at odds with the protection conferred by those regulations.</p>

            <p>As to whether, for the purposes of that determination, a relevant test is whether the ingredient protected by a PDO has been added in sufficient quantity to confer on the foodstuff concerned one of its essential characteristics, it should be noted that that test corresponds to one of the three conditions set out in Section 2.1.2 of the Guidelines for determining whether a name registered as a PDO may be mentioned in the trade name of a foodstuff incorporating products benefiting from that PDO. The Commission makes it clear, however, that, given the wide range of possible scenarios, it cannot suggest a minimum percentage to be uniformly applied.</p>

            <p>As to whether the ingredient in question confers on the foodstuff concerned one of its essential characteristics, the quantity of that ingredient in the overall composition of the foodstuff is a significant but not, in itself, a sufficient factor. Whether that is the case depends on the products concerned and entails a qualitative assessment. In that regard, as the Advocate General observed in points 76 and 77 of his Opinion, it is not a question of identifying in the foodstuff the essential characteristics of the ingredient protected by a PDO but of establishing that that foodstuff has an essential characteristic connected with that ingredient. That characteristic will often be the aroma or taste imparted by that ingredient.</p>

            <p>Where the name of the foodstuff indicates, as in the main proceedings, that it contains an ingredient protected by a PDO, which is intended to convey the taste of the foodstuff, the taste imparted by that ingredient must constitute the essential characteristic of that foodstuff. If the taste of the foodstuff is more attributable to other ingredients it contains, the use of such a name will take unfair advantage of the reputation of the PDO concerned. Thus, in order to determine whether the champagne contained in the product at issue in the main proceedings confers on it one of its essential characteristics, the national court must ascertain, in the light of the evidence before it, whether the taste of the product is attributable primarily to the presence of champagne in the composition of the product.</p>
