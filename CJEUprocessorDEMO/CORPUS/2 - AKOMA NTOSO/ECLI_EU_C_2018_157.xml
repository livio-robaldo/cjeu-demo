If there is sufficient evidence that, upon expiry of the transitional period, there will be serious disturbances or a threat of serious disturbances on the agricultural land market of Hungary, the Commission, at the request of Hungary, shall decide upon the extension of the transitional period for up to a maximum of three years.'</p>

In the judgment, the Alkotmánybíróság (Constitutional Court) also called on the legislature to rectify that omission by 1 December 2015 at the latest. That period expired without any measure being adopted for that purpose.</p>

            <p>The Szombathelyi Közigazgatási és Munkaügyi Bíróság (Administrative and Labour Court, Szombathely) is of the view that the national provisions at issue amount to a restriction on the rights of nationals of Member States other than Hungary to freedom of establishment and free movement of capital, since they are such as to deter such nationals from exercising those rights by acquiring rights of usufruct over agricultural properties, given the risk that they run of being prematurely deprived of those rights even though they derive from valid contracts.</p>

            <p>As regards the objectives pursued by the 2013 Law on agricultural land, the referring court sets out extracts from judgment No 25 of 21 July 2015 delivered by the Alkotmánybíróság (Constitutional Court), according to which, in particular, that law `achieves the national strategic objective, generally recognised and accepted after the change of regime, and constitutionally guaranteed by Article P of the Fundamental Law, under which, in essence, productive land can be owned only by the natural persons who work it'. The judgment adds that, `also, it is on account of that objective that that law provides that ownership of land cannot be acquired for the purposes of investment for the future, that is to say, in order to obtain a capital gain that would result from the increase of the price of land,' and that, `as is apparent from the preamble to that law, other objectives of legal policy which led to the drafting of that law were, inter alia, that the sale of agricultural and forestry land and the creation of mortgages over such land for the purpose of securing loans effectively facilitate the working thereof by newly set up undertakings, that properties be created of a size that enables viable and competitive agricultural production, that the organisation of agriculture based on ownership not be threatened by the harmful effects of the fragmentation of land, and that every farmer be able to pursue peacefully his agricultural production activity'.</p>

            <p>As regards the provisions more specifically at issue in the main proceedings, the referring court observes that it is apparent from that judgment of the Alkotmánybíróság (Constitutional Court) that `the specific reason given for Paragraph 108(1) of the 2013 Law on transitional measures being necessary and expedient was that, so far as concerns the ownership of productive land, in order to achieve fully the national strategic objective pursued by the new regime, that law had to eliminate the legal effects of a practice for the acquisition of productive land which had developed for nearly two decades and on account of which the right of usufruct had been applied in a dysfunctional manner'. That judgment explains that, `in its operation, the new regime cannot, so far as concerns ownership, usufruct and the use of productive land, fail to incorporate the requirement that the situations specified in the property register must reflect legal relationships that are consistent with the Fundamental Law'. Consequently, according to the judgment, `it was necessary to adopt measures preventing the application of legal arrangements known, in everyday language, as ``pocket contracts '' and, therefore, to provide that it is not possible to continue to apply rights or obligations, or any legal remedies, on the basis of existing legal relationships, so as to escape the previous prohibitions and restrictions concerning the acquisition of ownership'.</p>

            <p>According to the referring court, the Hungarian legislature did not, however, sufficiently establish the necessity for and the proportionality of the rules at issue -- as the grounds of the 2013 Law on transitional measures in particular neither enable a sufficiently demonstrated legitimate objective in the public interest to be identified in that law or those grounds nor reveal arguments justifying the indiscriminate cancellation of rights of usufruct, without compensation or an appropriate transitional period -- or the necessity, in that last respect, to reduce to a few months the period, previously 20 years, during which the rights of usufruct concerned could continue to exist until they were cancelled.</p>

            <p>In particular, according to the referring court, the legal presumption which, although not expressly set out in the legislation concerned, is at its base, that all the private contracts which created rights of usufruct and rights of use were entered into in order to avoid the previous prohibitions relating to the acquisition of ownership, is intended to bring alleged old infringements of the law to an end. The Hungarian legislature thus prescribed, by legislative measures, the effects of the alleged invalidity of those contracts, without however showing that that legislation was in the public interest; it also denied the persons concerned the possibility of proving that their contracts were valid in an administrative procedure and compromised their right, laid down in Article 47 of the Charter, to a fair hearing.</p>

That could be so because the legislation previously in force expressly prohibited foreign natural and legal persons wishing to farm agricultural land in Hungary from acquiring the ownership of such land and the proportion of holders of rights of usufruct or rights of use is therefore higher in the case of nationals of the other Member States than in the case of Hungarian nationals.</p>

            <p>The Hungarian Government contends, first, that, since the usufruct contracts at issue in the main proceedings were entered into before the 2003 Treaty of Accession entered into force, their validity depends exclusively on the rules of national law in force when they were entered into. Consequently, the Court lacks jurisdiction to assess those rules in the light of EU law and, therefore, to rule on the subsequent cancellation, by the rules at issue in the main proceedings, of rights of usufruct which, in this instance, were created unlawfully in the light of the national law prior to the accession of the Member State concerned to the European Union.</p>

Paragraph 108 of the 2013 Law on transitional measures had already produced all its effects and the referring court is not able to decide upon the re-establishment or preservation of the rights of usufruct at issue in the main proceedings.</p>

Consequently, where the questions submitted concern the interpretation of EU Union law, the Court is in principle bound to give a ruling (judgment of 24 April 2012, Kamberaj, C‑571/10, EU:C:2012:233, paragraph 40 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the present instance, Paragraph 108 of the 2013 Law on transitional measures had the consequence that the rights of usufruct at issue in the main proceedings were extinguished by operation of law. Thus, that paragraph, like Paragraph 94 of the Law on the property register, is at the origin of the decisions deleting rights of usufruct from the property register that are at issue in the main proceedings. It follows, first, that the interpretation of EU law which is sought in the present instance and which is intended to enable the referring court to determine whether those national provisions comply with EU law bears a definite relation to the purpose of the main proceedings and, second, that the questions submitted are not hypothetical.</p>

            <p>It should be recalled that, according to settled case-law, national courts have the widest discretion to refer to the Court of Justice questions of interpretation of relevant provisions of EU law and that a rule of national law cannot prevent a national court from using that discretion. Such a discretion is an inherent part of the system of cooperation between the national courts and the Court established in Article 267 TFEU and of the functions of the court responsible for the application of EU law which are entrusted by that provision to the national courts (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 April 2016, PFE, C‑689/13, EU:C:2016:199, paragraphs 32 and 33 and the case-law cited). The Court has thus held in particular that the existence of a rule of national law whereby courts against whose decisions there is a judicial remedy are bound on points of law by the rulings of a court superior to them cannot, on the basis of that fact alone, deprive the lower courts of that discretion (judgment of 22 June 2010, Melki and Abdeli, C‑188/10 and C‑189/10, EU:C:2010:363, paragraph 42).</p>

            <p>The national provisions at issue in the main proceedings essentially have the purpose of cancelling by operation of law previously acquired rights of usufruct over agricultural land where the holders of those rights do not satisfy the conditions to which the acquisition of rights of usufruct over agricultural land is henceforth subject under national legislation, and of arranging, consequently, for the deletion of such previously acquired rights from the property registers.</p>

            <p>A preliminary point to note is that, whilst Article 345 TFEU, to which the Hungarian Government referred in its observations, expresses the principle that the Treaties are neutral in relation to the rules in Member States governing the system of property ownership, that article does not, however, mean that rules governing the system of property ownership current in the Member States are not subject to the fundamental rules of the FEU Treaty (judgment of 22 October 2013, Essent and Others, C‑105/12 to C‑107/12, EU:C:2013:677, paragraphs 29 and 36 and the case-law cited, and Opinion 2/15(Free Trade Agreement with Singapore) of 16 May 2017, EU:C:2017:376, paragraph 107). Thus, although Article 345 TFEU does not call into question the Member States' right to establish a system for the acquisition of immovable property which lays down specific measures applying to transactions concerning agricultural and forestry land, such a system remains subject inter alia to the rule of non-discrimination, and to the rules relating to freedom of establishment and free movement of capital (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 September 2003, Ospelt and Schlössle Weissenberg, C‑452/01, EU:C:2003:493, paragraph 24 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Also, since the questions submitted for a preliminary ruling refer to the provisions of the Treaty relating both to freedom of establishment and to the free movement of capital, it is necessary to determine which freedom is at issue in the main proceedings (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 February 2014, Hervis Sport- és Divatkereskedelmi, C‑385/12, EU:C:2014:47, paragraph 20).</p>

            <p>To do this, the purpose of the national legislation at issue must be taken into consideration (judgment of 5 February 2014, Hervis Sport- és Divatkereskedelmi, C‑385/12, EU:C:2014:47, paragraph 21 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the case of legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, the purpose of which has been stated in paragraph 50 above, it should be noted that, when the right to acquire, use or dispose of immovable property on the territory of another Member State is exercised as the corollary of the right of establishment, it generates capital movements (see, to that effect, judgment of 25 January 2007, Festersen, C‑370/05, EU:C:2007:59, paragraph 22 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>As is clear from the nomenclature of capital movements set out in Annex I to Council Directive 88/361/EEC of 24 June 1988 for the implementation of Article 67 of the [EC] Treaty (an article repealed by the Treaty of Amsterdam) ( OJ 1988 L 178, p. 5), capital movements include investments in real estate on the territory of a Member State by non-residents; that nomenclature still has the same indicative value for the purposes of defining the notion of capital movements (judgment of 25 January 2007, Festersen, C‑370/05, EU:C:2007:59, paragraph 23 and the case-law cited).</p>

In the light of the matters referred to in paragraphs 68 to 70 above, it appears likely that that measure affected a markedly higher proportion of the members of the first of those groups than of the second (see, to that effect, judgment of 9 February 1999, Seymour-Smith and Perez, C‑167/97, EU:C:1999:60, paragraph 59).</p>

Thus, that legislation seeks to limit the ownership of productive land to the persons who work it and to prevent its acquisition for purely speculative purposes, and also to enable it to be farmed by new undertakings, to facilitate the creation of properties of a size that enables viable and competitive agricultural production, and to prevent a fragmentation of agricultural land as well as migration from rural areas and depopulation of the countryside.</p>

These objectives are indeed consistent with those of the common agricultural policy which, under Article 39(1)(b) TFEU, aims `to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community' and in the working-out of which, according to Article 39(2)(a) TFEU, account must be taken of `the particular nature of agricultural activity, which results from the social structure of agriculture and from structural and natural disparities between the various agricultural regions' (see, to that effect, judgment of 25 January 2007, Festersen, C‑370/05, EU:C:2007:59, paragraphs 27 and 28 and the case-law cited).</p>

Indeed, those rules of civil law, which are moreover not mentioned by the legislation at issue in the main proceedings, do not make it easy to determine whether compensation will in fact be obtainable at the end of such procedures or disclose the nature of the compensation.

            <p>Also, it is apparent that other measures less restrictive of the free movement of capital than those laid down by the legislation at issue in the main proceedings could have been adopted for the purpose of ensuring that the existence of a right of usufruct over productive land does not result in that land ceasing to be farmed by the person in occupation of it or that the acquisition of such a right neither has purely speculative aims nor leads to a use or fragmentation which might be incompatible with the lasting use of the land for agricultural purposes.</p>

            <p>In this regard, it would, for example, have been possible, as the Advocate General has noted in point 114 of his Opinion, to require the usufructuary to preserve the agricultural use of the land concerned, as the case may be by actually farming it himself, under conditions ensuring the viability of farming it. The explanations provided by the Hungarian Government seem, moreover, to indicate that such a requirement was favoured in the case of acquiring full ownership of a parcel of agricultural land or being granted a long lease over it. In the light of the information in the case file before the Court, it is not apparent that such an approach could not have been adopted as regards acquisitions of a usufruct.</p>

            <p>As regards the first of those aspects, it is apparent, furthermore, from the observations of the Hungarian Government that no authorisation of that type was ever sought for the purpose of acquiring a usufruct over productive land and that, notwithstanding that fact, a very large number of rights of usufruct acquired by non-residents, without such an authorisation, gave rise to entries in the property registers.</p>

            <p>As regards the second aspect, it should be recalled that the legislation at issue in the main proceedings provides for the systematic extinguishment of rights of usufruct held over agricultural land by persons unable to demonstrate a close family tie with the owner of the land concerned. As the Advocate General has observed in point 94 of his Opinion, that family-tie criterion is unrelated to the legislation concerning exchange controls. Furthermore, by virtue of that criterion the cancellation of rights of usufruct is applicable in respect not only of non-residents but also of residents; indeed, the Hungarian Government itself stated in its pleadings that, of the 100000 or so holders of rights of usufruct or rights of use affected by that measure providing for cancellation, roughly 95000 are Hungarian nationals.</p>

            <p>First of all, it should be noted that, as has been stated in paragraphs 6 and 7 above and is apparent from the referring court's explanations relating to national law, after the legislative amendments made in 1991 and 1994 for the purpose of preventing natural persons not possessing Hungarian nationality and legal persons from acquiring agricultural land, any person remained free, on the other hand, to acquire a right of usufruct over such land. According to those explanations, it was only from 1 January 2002 that the 1994 Law was amended so as also to preclude a right of usufruct over agricultural land from being created by contract in favour of those natural and legal persons.</p>

            <p>The Hungarian Government contends, however, that acquisitions such as those that related to the rights of usufruct at issue in the main proceedings were effected in fraudulent evasion of the law, to circumvent the statutory prohibition that prevented natural persons not possessing Hungarian nationality and legal persons from acquiring the ownership of agricultural land.</p>

            <p>According to the Hungarian Government, the continuance of situations of that kind was contrary to public policy and it was therefore incumbent upon the State to remedy them. It states that the Hungarian legislature, instead of having recourse to the most classical approach, consisting in declaring, following a judicial examination on a case-by-case basis, that the contracts at issue were void, decided to remedy by force of law the deficiencies of the legal rule previously laid down or, indeed, the absence of any relevant rule of law. The Hungarian Government adds that that approach was favoured, in particular for budgetary reasons and reasons relating to the economising of judicial resources, in the light both of the large number of cases that potentially were to give rise to such an examination and of the need to amend the legislation relating to the acquisition of agricultural land before 1 May 2014, the date on which the transitional regime resulting from the 2003 Act of Accession was to expire.</p>

To that end, it is incumbent upon the Court solely to determine whether or not the legislation at issue in the main proceedings is capable of being justified by a desire to combat practices which were allegedly designed to circumvent national law and, consequently, as the Hungarian Government contends, of being justified on grounds of public policy within the meaning of Article 65 TFEU.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, the view cannot be taken that such legislation pursues the specific aim of combating conduct that consisted in the creation of artificial arrangements aimed at circumventing national legislation relating to acquisition of agricultural land. It should, moreover, be noted that such legislation seeks, generally, to cancel by operation of law all rights of usufruct held by legal persons, or by natural persons in so far as they cannot demonstrate a close family tie with the owner of the agricultural land, without in any way linking those cancellations to the reasons which led the persons concerned to make such acquisitions (see, by analogy, judgment of 12 December 2002, Lankhorst-Hohorst, C‑324/00, EU:C:2002:749, paragraph 37).</p>

            <p>Second, assuming that the legislation at issue in the main proceedings can be regarded as having been adopted with such a specific aim of combating artificial arrangements, it cannot reasonably be inferred from the mere fact that the holder of a right of usufruct over a parcel of agricultural land is a legal person or a natural person who does not have the status of close relation of the owner of that land that the conduct of such a person when acquiring such a right of usufruct constituted an abuse.

            <p>In this connection, the Hungarian Government's line of argument that is based on budgetary considerations and considerations relating to the economising of judicial resources cannot be accepted. It is settled case-law that grounds of a purely economic nature cannot constitute overriding reasons in the public interest justifying a restriction of a fundamental freedom guaranteed by the Treaty (judgment of 17 March 2005, Kranemann, C‑109/04, EU:C:2005:187, paragraph 34 and the case-law cited). The same is true of considerations of a purely administrative nature (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 November 1999, Arblade and Others, C‑369/96 and C‑376/96, EU:C:1999:575, paragraph 37 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>As is apparent from the reasoning set out in paragraphs 81 to 126 above, legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings which restricts the free movement of capital cannot be justified, in accordance with the principle of proportionality, either by overriding reasons in the public interest that are recognised by the case-law or on the basis of Article 65 TFEU, so that it infringes Article 63 TFEU.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, it is not necessary to examine the aforesaid national legislation in the light of Articles 17 and 47 of the Charter in order to resolve the disputes in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the questions referred is that Article 63 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, under which rights of usufruct which have previously been created over agricultural land and the holders of which do not have the status of close relation of the owner of that land are extinguished by operation of law and are, consequently, deleted from the property registers.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules: Article 63 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, under which rights of usufruct which have previously been created over agricultural land and the holders of which do not have the status of close relation of the owner of that land are extinguished by operation of law and are, consequently, deleted from the property registers.</p>
