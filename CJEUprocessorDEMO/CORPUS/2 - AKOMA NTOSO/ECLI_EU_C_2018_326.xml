            <p>Council Directive 91/414/EEC of 15 July 1991 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market ( OJ 1991 L 230, p. 1) was repealed by Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 October 2009 concerning the placing of plant protection products on the market and repealing Council Directives 79/117/EEC and 91/414 ( OJ 2009 L 309, p. 1). However, having regard to the fact that the repeal took effect from 14 June 2011 and the facts at issue in the main proceedings arose before that date, it is therefore necessary to have regard to Directive 91/414, as amended by Directive 2010/28. The fifth to seventh and ninth recitals of Directive 91/414 stated: `Whereas, in view of the hazards, there are rules in most Member States governing the authorisation of plant health products; whereas these rules present differences which constitute barriers not only to trade in plant protection products but also to trade in plant products, and thereby directly affect the establishment and operation of the internal market; Whereas it is therefore desirable to eliminate such barriers by harmonising the provisions laid down in the Member States; Whereas uniform rules on the conditions and procedures for the authorisation of plant protection products must be applied by the Member States; ... Whereas the provisions governing authorisation must ensure a high standard of protection, which, in particular, must prevent the authorisation of plant protection products whose risks to health, groundwater and the environment [have not been researched properly]; ... human and animal health should take priority over the objective of improving plant production'.</p>

During the 12-year period referred to in the first subparagraph it may, following examination by the Committee referred to in Article 19 of such active substance, be decided by the procedure laid down in that Article that the substance can be included in Annex I and under which conditions, or, in cases where the requirements of Article 5 are not satisfied or the requisite information and data have not been submitted within the prescribed period, that such active substance will not be included in Annex I.

            <p>On 2 May 2003 the Commission adopted Decision 2003/308/EC concerning the non-inclusion of metalaxyl in Annex I to Directive 91/414 and the withdrawal of authorisations for plant protection products containing this active substance ( OJ 2003 L 113, p. 8). The Court of Justice annulled that decision by its judgment of 18 July 2007, Industrias Químicas del Vallés v Commission ( C‑326/05 P, EU:C:2007:443). As a result of that annulment, Directive 2010/28 was adopted. It entered into force on 1 July 2010 and, consequently, metalaxyl was included in Annex I to Directive 91/414.</p>

                <p>In the event that it is held that the time limit may be extended, is the decision concerning such an extension to be taken without regard to any specific procedural rules concerning applying for and granting the extension or does it fall within the competence of the Member States, which must decide the question in accordance with domestic legislation since they are the addressees of the provisions establishing the procedure under Article 3(1) of Directive [2010/28]?'</p>

                </tblock>
                <p>26 By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 3(1) of Directive 2010/28 must be interpreted as meaning that the time limit that it lays down, which expired on 31 December 2010, in order to allow Member States to amend or withdraw, in accordance with Directive 91/414, existing authorisations for plant protection products containing metalaxyl as an active substance, is a mandatory time limit or whether it may be extended by those Member States.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be recalled that, in accordance with the Court's established case-law, when interpreting a provision of EU law, it is necessary to consider not only its wording but also the context in which it occurs and the objectives pursued by the rules of which it is part (see, to that effect, judgments of 22 June 2016, Thomas Philipps, C‑419/15, EU:C:2016:468, paragraph 18, and of 26 July 2017, Jafari, C‑646/16, EU:C:2017:586, paragraph 73 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>As regards, in the first place, the wording of Article 3(1) of Directive 2010/28, the first paragraph thereof provides that `Member States shall in accordance with Directive [91/414], where necessary, amend or withdraw existing authorisations for plant protection products containing metalaxyl as an active substance by 31 December 2010'. The second paragraph of that provision provides that `by that date, [the Member States] shall in particular verify that the conditions in Annex I to that Directive relating to metalaxyl are met, with the exception of those identified in part B of the entry concerning that active substance, and that the holder of the authorisation has, or has access to, a dossier satisfying the requirements of Annex II to that Directive'.</p>

            <p>First, the first paragraph of Article 3(1) sets out clearly the consequences of a failure to meet, by 31 December 2010, the conditions laid down in the second paragraph of that article, in particular the obligation for the holder of an existing authorisation for a plant protection product containing metalaxyl to possess, or have access to, a dossier that meets the requirements of Annex II of Directive 91/414 by that date. Those consequences consist of the amendment or withdrawal of such an authorisation by the Member State concerned.</p>

            <p>Article 3(1) of Directive 2010/28 therefore established, in accordance with the objective referred to in the seventh recital of Directive 91/414, a framework that was uniform throughout the European Union comprising the conditions under which the Member States amended or withdrew authorisations for plant protection products containing metalaxyl, and also the obligations imposed on the holders of those authorisations as to the submission of the dossiers relating to those products. To authorise Member States to derogate from the deadline of 31 December 2010 would jeopardise the uniform nature of that framework and respect for the equal treatment of the holders of those existing authorisations.</p>

            <p>Secondly, Article 3(2) of Directive 2010/28 provides, by way of derogation from paragraph 1 of that article, time limits longer than that provided for in paragraph 1 in order to enable Member States to carry out the re-evaluation of authorised plant protection products containing metalaxyl as either the only active substance or as one of several active substances. If, as the Spanish Government submits, Member States were entitled to extend the time limit laid down in Article 3(1) of Directive 2010/28 on duly justified grounds, the inclusion, in paragraph 2 of that article, of such an express derogation from the time limit laid down in paragraph 1 would have been unnecessary.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, the non-extendible nature of the time limit laid down in Article 3(1) of Directive 2010/28 is also corroborated by the text of the fourth paragraph of Article 8(2) of Directive 91/414. As the Advocate General observed in point 65 of his opinion, that provision provides that, following the decision of the Commission to include, or not to include, an active substance in Annex I to that directive, the Member States are to ensure that the relevant authorisations are granted, withdrawn or varied as appropriate, `within a prescribed period'. That period must be understood as the period that expires on the date referred to in Article 3(1) of Directive 2010/28, namely 31 December 2010.</p>

            <p>As regards, in the third and final place, the aim of Directive 2010/28, it must be noted that it is a directive which implements Directive 91/414. It must therefore, in accordance with the settled case-law of the Court, be interpreted, as far as possible, consistently with the provisions of the basic directive, namely Directive 91/414 (see, to that effect, the judgments of 22 May 2008, Feinchemie Schwebda and Bayer CropScience, C‑361/06, EU:C:2008:296, paragraph 49, and of 26 July 2017, Czech Republic v Commission, C‑696/15 P, EU:C:2017:595, paragraph 33).</p>

          <content eId="para_11954__content">
            <p>According to its fifth, sixth and ninth recitals, Directive 91/414 seeks to remove barriers to intra-Community trade in plant products, while maintaining a high level of protection of the environment and of human and animal health (judgment of 18 July 2007, Industrias Químicas del Vallés v Commission, C‑326/05 P, EU:C:2007:443, paragraph 74).</p>

            <p>In that context, to permit the extension of the time limit prescribed in Article 3(1) of Directive 2010/28 would result in a risk that plant protection products containing the active substance metalaxyl that did not meet the requirements stemming from Annex I to Directive 91/414, as amended by Directive 2010/28, in particular the purity level laid down, remaining on the market beyond the date of 31 December 2010. Such a consequence would be contrary to the pursued objective of ensuring a high level of protection for the environment and human and animal health.</p>

            <p>It follows from the considerations in paragraphs 29 to 37 above that the deadline laid down in Article 3(1) of Directive 2010/28 is a mandatory deadline, which cannot be extended by the Member States.</p>

            <p>That conclusion is not called into question by the judgment of 18 July 2007, Industrias Químicas del Vallés v Commission ( C‑326/05 P, EU:C:2007:443). In that regard, it must be recalled, first, as the Advocate General observed in paragraph 80 of his opinion, that the case that gave rise to that judgment concerned a time limit set by the Commission in the context of the procedure for the inclusion of metalaxyl in Annex I to Directive 91/414 and the possibility for that institution, and not for the Member States, of changing that time limit. By contrast, the case in the main proceedings, which concerns the procedure of re-evaluation by the Member States of existing marketing authorisations for plant protection products containing metalaxyl, raises the question of whether, as regards a time limit set by the Commission and included in the provisions of a Directive, Member States may, unilaterally, extend that time limit.</p>

            <p>Second, in the judgment of 18 July 2007, Industrias Químicas del Vallés v Commission ( C‑326/05 P, EU:C:2007:443), the Court relied on the fact that the party concerned had been placed in a position that made it impossible for it to submit a complete dossier within the time limit owing partly to the contradictory conduct of the competent authorities, including the Commission. It is clear from the order for reference that, contrary the situation that arose in the case that gave rise to that judgment, Sapec Agro was not, in the present case, affected by that kind of circumstance beyond its control. On the contrary, the obligation to possess, or have access to, within the prescribed time limit, a dossier that met the requirements laid down in Annex II to Directive 91/414 was clearly established from the beginning of the procedure, since it was provided for in Article 3(1) of Directive 2010/28.</p>

            <p>Having regard to all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the question referred is that Article 3(1) of Directive 2010/28 must be interpreted as meaning that the time limit that it lays down, expiring on 31 December 2010, to allow Member State to amend or withdraw, in accordance with Directive 91/414, existing authorisations for plant protection products containing metalaxyl as an active substance, is a mandatory time limit, which cannot be extended by those Member States.</p>
