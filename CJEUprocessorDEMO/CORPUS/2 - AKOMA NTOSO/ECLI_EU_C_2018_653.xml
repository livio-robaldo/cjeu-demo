In that regard, the referring court notes that Article 17 of the KSchG, which transposes Article 2 of that directive almost word-for-word, gives rise, on a national level, to differences in interpretation, particularly of the concept of `undertaking controlling the employer'. Accordingly, a broad interpretation of that concept that also includes undertakings not linked in terms of legislation on groups of companies but subject only to a de jure or de facto control could render the redundancies at issue in the main proceedings void, whereas that would not be the case if a restrictive interpretation was applied to that term.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the Landesarbeitsgericht Berlin-Brandenburg (Higher Labour Court, Berlin-Brandenburg) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions, worded identically in each case, to the Court for a preliminary ruling: `</p>

                <p>If the answer to Question 1 is to the effect that an influence ensured through shareholdings and voting rights is not required: Does it constitute a ``decision regarding collective redundancies '' within the meaning of the first paragraph of Article 2(4) of Directive 98/59 if the controlling undertaking imposes requirements on the employer such that it is economically necessary for the employer to effect collective redundancies?</p>

            <p>It must be noted, as a preliminary point, that the German Government contends that this question is inadmissible inasmuch as it concerns a hypothetical problem and that the Court is unable, in the light of the matters of fact and of law put forward by the referring court, to give a useful reply.</p>

Consequently, where the questions submitted concern the interpretation of EU law, the Court is in principle bound to give a ruling (judgment of 6 March 2018, SEGRO and Horváth, C‑52/16 and C‑113/16, EU:C:2018:157, paragraph 42 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the first subparagraph of Article 2(4) of Directive 98/59 must be interpreted as meaning that the term `undertaking controlling the employer' covers only an undertaking linked to that employer by shareholdings or voting rights, or whether it also covers an undertaking with a decisive contractual or factual influence over that employer.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be noted, first, that the first subparagraph of Article 2(4) of Directive 98/59 does not define `undertaking controlling the employer', nor does it refer to the law of the Member States on that issue. According to the Court's settled case-law, the need for uniform application of EU law and the principle of equality require that the terms of a provision of EU law which makes no express reference to the law of the Member States for the purpose of determining its meaning and scope must normally be given an autonomous and uniform interpretation throughout the European Union (see, inter alia, judgments of 27 January 2005, Junk, C‑188/03, EU:C:2005:59, paragraphs 29 and 30, and of 13 May 2015, Lyttle and Others, C‑182/13, EU:C:2015:317, paragraph 26 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_18818__content">
            <p>In those circumstances, and like the term `establishment' referred to in Article 1(1)(a)(ii) of Directive 98/59, the term `undertaking controlling the employer' referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 2(4) of that directive must be interpreted in an autonomous and uniform manner in the EU legal order (see, to that effect, judgment of 13 May 2015, Lyttle and Others, C‑182/13, EU:C:2015:317, paragraph 26 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_18819__content">
            <p>As a preliminary point, it must be clarified that the concept of `control' for the purposes of Directive 98/59 refers, as the Advocate General noted in point 50 of her Opinion, to a situation in which an undertaking may adopt a strategic or commercial decision compelling the employer to contemplate or to plan for collective redundancies (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 September 2009, Akavan Erityisalojen Keskusliitto AEK and Others, C‑44/08, EU:C:2009:533, paragraph 48).</p>

          <content eId="para_18820__content">
            <p>That having been clarified, it is not possible to determine from the wording of the first subparagraph of Article 2(4) of Directive 98/59 alone, what the links are between the undertaking and the employer that determine when the former `controls' the latter. In that context, account must be taken of the origins of that provision as well as the objective pursued by the legislation at issue in the main proceedings.</p>

          <content eId="para_18821__content">
            <p>As regards, first, the origins of the first subparagraph of Article 2(4) of Directive 98/59, it must be noted that the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to collective redundancies was, initially, the subject of Directive 75/129, referred to in paragraph 3 of this judgment, which was amended by Directive 92/56.</p>

            <p>Recital 6 of Directive 92/56 states that it is necessary to ensure that employers' obligations as regards information, consultation and notification apply independently of the fact that the decision on collective redundancies emanates from the employer or from an undertaking which controls that employer. To that end, Directive 92/56 inserted a paragraph 4 into Article 2 of Directive 75/129, which corresponds to Article 2(4) of Directive 98/59.</p>

            <p>Both Directive 98/59 and, before that, Directive 75/129 which it replaced, provide for a partial harmonisation of the rules for the protection of workers in the event of collective redundancies, that is to say, harmonisation of the procedure to be followed when such redundancies are to be effected (judgment of 21 December 2016, AGET Iraklis, C‑201/15, EU:C:2016:972, paragraph 29 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_18824__content">
            <p>In that regard, the Court has clarified in the context of that partial harmonisation that the legislature intended, with its adoption of Directive 92/56 and then Directive 98/59, to fill a gap in its earlier legislation and to add clarification concerning the obligations of employers who are part of a group of undertakings. Thus, against an economic background marked by the increasing presence of groups of undertakings, Article 2(4) of Directive 98/59 serves to ensure, where one undertaking is controlled by another, that the purpose of that directive, which, as is stated in recital 2 of its preamble, is to promote greater protection for workers in the event of collective redundancies, is actually achieved (judgment of 10 September 2009, AkavanErityisalojen Keskusliitto AEK and Others, C‑44/08, EU:C:2009:533, paragraph 44 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_18825__content">
            <p>Consequently, the Court has interpreted Article 2(1) and the first subparagraph of Article 2(4) of Directive 98/59 to the effect that, under those provisions, irrespective of whether collective redundancies are contemplated or projected as a result of a decision of the undertaking which employs the workers concerned or a decision of its parent company, it is always the former of those two companies which is obliged, as the employer, to start consultations with the representatives of its workers (judgment of 10 September 2009, Akavan Erityisalojen Keskusliitto AEK and Others, C‑44/08, EU:C:2009:533, paragraph 62).</p>

            <p>With regard to the objective of Directive 98/59, second, it is clear from recital 2 that that is to afford greater protection to workers in the case of collective redundancies. In that regard, the Court has clarified that, under Article 2(2) of the directive, the consultations with workers' representatives before the collective redundancy are to cover ways and means of avoiding collective redundancies or reducing the number of workers affected, and of mitigating the consequences by recourse to accompanying social measures aimed, inter alia, at aid for redeploying or retraining workers made redundant (judgment of 21 December 2016, AGET Iraklis, C‑201/15, EU:C:2016:972, paragraphs 27 and 28).</p>

          <num>39</num>
          <content eId="para_18827__content">
            <p>To that end, the protection of workers in the event of collective redundancies is as great as the criteria applied for defining the term `undertaking controlling the employer' referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 2(4) of Directive 98/59 are wide, those criteria nonetheless having to respect EU law and its principles, such as the principle of legal certainty.</p>

          <content eId="para_18828__content">
            <p>In those circumstances, it follows from an interpretation of the origins and the objective of the first subparagraph of Article 2(4) of Directive 98/59, first, that the term `undertaking controlling the employer' covers all undertakings which, by virtue of belonging to the same group or having a shareholding that gives it the majority of votes in the general meeting and/or the decision-making bodies within the employer, are able to require the latter to adopt a decision contemplating or planning for collective redundancies.</p>

            <p>Moreover, situations in which an undertaking, while not having the majority of votes referred to in the preceding paragraph, is able to exercise decisive influence within the meaning of paragraph 31 of this judgment, which is expressed in the results of votes in company bodies owing, inter alia, to the employer having dispersed capital, a relatively low level of participation by the members at general meetings or the existence of pacts between members within that employer, must also be regarded as falling within that notion.</p>

          <content eId="para_18830__content">
            <p>Second, in order to ensure protection of the principle of legal certainty, purely factual criteria such as the existence of a common patrimonial interest between the employer and the other undertaking or the `undertaking's own best interests to satisfy its information, consultation and notification obligations provided for by Directive 98/59', put forward by the Commission in its written and oral submissions, cannot establish the existence of a situation in which an undertaking controls the employer within the meaning of the first subparagraph of Article 2(4) of Directive 98/59.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the possible use of such criteria could require a competent national court to carry out difficult investigations, such as the assessment of the nature and intensity of the various interests common to the undertakings concerned, leading to an uncertain result, which could undermine the principle of legal certainty.</p>

            <p>In addition, it is not disputed that a simple contractual relationship, in so far as such a relationship does not allow an undertaking to exercise a decisive influence on dismissal decisions taken by the employer, cannot be considered sufficient to establish a situation of control within the meaning of the first subparagraph of Article 2(4) of Directive 98/59.</p>
