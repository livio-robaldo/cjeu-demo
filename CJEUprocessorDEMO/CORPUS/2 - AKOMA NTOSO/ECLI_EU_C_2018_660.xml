            <p>It is apparent from the judgment under appeal that on 20 January 2014 ClientEarth, which is a non-profit organisation whose purpose is the protection of the environment, submitted to the Commission two requests for access to documents held by that institution, pursuant to Regulation No 1049/2001. The first of those requests concerned a draft impact assessment report relating to access to justice in environmental matters at Member State level in the field of EU environmental policy and an opinion of the Impact Assessment Board regarding that draft ( `the impact assessment documents regarding access to justice in environmental matters'). The second request concerned an impact assessment report regarding a proposed binding instrument setting a strategic framework for risk-based inspection and surveillance in relation to EU environmental legislation and an opinion of the Impact Assessment Board regarding that report ( `the impact assessment documents regarding inspections and surveillance in environmental matters') (taken together with the impact assessment documents regarding access to justice in environmental matters, `the documents at issue').</p>

            <p>By letters of 13 and 17 February 2014, the Commission, relying on the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001, refused to grant those two requests.</p>

            <p>On 4 March 2014 ClientEarth, pursuant to Article 7(2) of that regulation, lodged two confirmatory applications with the Commission. By the decisions at issue, the Commission confirmed its refusal to grant access to the documents at issue.</p>

          <content eId="para_18934__content">
            <p>In those decisions, the Commission noted, in the first place, that those documents related to ongoing impact assessments carried out with a view to the adoption of legislative initiatives relating to inspections and surveillance in respect of environmental matters, on the one hand, and access to justice in such matters, on the other. It explained, in that regard, that impact assessments were intended to help it in preparing its legislative proposals and that the content of those assessments were used to support the policy choices made in such proposals. Therefore, according to the Commission, the disclosure, at that stage, of the documents at issue would seriously undermine its ongoing decision-making processes. Indeed, that disclosure would restrict its room for manoeuvre, reduce its ability to reach a compromise, and might create external pressures which could hinder those delicate processes, during which an atmosphere of trust ought to prevail. The Commission made reference to Article 17(1) TEU and to the third subparagraph of Article 17(3) TEU in that regard.</p>

            <p>Concerning the impact assessment documents regarding inspections and surveillance in environmental matters, the Commission stressed, first, that those inspections and that surveillance were a key element in the implementation of public policy -- an area in which the EU institutions have, since 2001, been attempting to raise awareness and promote action at EU level -- and, second, that no external factors should influence the debate, as such influence would affect the quality of control over the Member States.</p>

          <content eId="para_18936__content">
            <p>Concerning the impact assessment documents regarding access to justice in environmental matters, the Commission focused on the sensitive nature of that issue, the possible differences of opinion between Member States, and the fact that 10 years had elapsed since the submission, on 24 October 2003, of its proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on access to justice in environmental matters (COM(2003) 624 final) ( OJ 2004 C 96, p. 22).</p>

            <p>Moreover, the Commission added that various documents relating to the two impact assessments in question were already available on the internet and that all the other documents relating to those assessments would be published upon the adoption of the legislative proposals concerned by the College of Commissioners.</p>

            <p>The Commission concluded from this that access to the documents at issue had to be refused on the basis of the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001, given that the decision-making processes relating thereto were at a very early and delicate stage.</p>

          <content eId="para_18939__content">
            <p>In the second place, the Commission considered that there was no overriding public interest in disclosure of the documents at issue. In that regard, it observed, in essence, that, although the objective of preserving, protecting and improving the quality of the environment and, as a consequence, of human health could be achieved through non-discriminatory access to justice, nevertheless it did not feel that it was in a position to determine how the disclosure, at that stage, of those documents would help persons living in the European Union indirectly to influence the environment in which they live. Indeed, access to justice was already possible before the national courts and the decision-making processes in question merely sought to improve that access. In addition, the Commission pointed out that a public consultation had been organised in 2013, during which interested parties, including civil society, had been able to help define the broad outlines of the proposals. Furthermore, disclosure, at that stage, of the documents at issue would undermine its decision-making processes and reduce the likelihood of achieving the best possible compromise. The public interest would be better served by the possibility of completing those processes without any external pressure.</p>

          <content eId="para_18940__content">
            <p>In the third place, the Commission ruled out the possibility of granting partial access to the documents at issue under Article 4(6) of Regulation No 1049/2001, given that those documents were covered in their entirety by the exception laid down in the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) of that regulation.</p>

            <p>By applications lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 11 June 2014, ClientEarth brought two actions for annulment of the Commission's decision of 1 April 2014 (Case T‑425/14) and its decision of 3 April 2014 (Case T‑424/14), as referred to in paragraph 1 above. In addition, it claimed that the General Court should order the Commission to pay the costs. By order of the President of the Second Chamber of the General Court of 27 April 2015, those cases were joined for the purposes of the oral procedure and the judgment.</p>

          <content eId="para_18942__content">
            <p>In those actions, ClientEarth raised a single plea in law, divided, in essence, into two parts. In support of the first part of that plea, alleging infringement of the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001, it put forward three complaints alleging, first, that that provision was not applicable, second, that there was no risk that the Commission's decision-making processes would be seriously undermined and, third, that there was an overriding public interest in disclosure of the documents at issue. ClientEarth expressly withdrew the first complaint at the hearing before the General Court, a note of which was made in the minutes of that hearing. By the second part of that plea, ClientEarth claimed that the Commission had failed to fulfil its duty to provide a statement of reasons.</p>

            <p>Regarding the first part, having found that the Commission had not carried out a specific and individual examination of the documents at issue, the General Court nonetheless verified whether that institution was entitled to refuse to grant access to those documents under the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001 by relying on a general presumption that disclosure of that type of document would, in principle, seriously undermine its ongoing decision-making processes for the purposes of that provision.</p>

            <p>To that end, the General Court noted, first, in paragraphs 68 to 75 of the judgment under appeal, that the documents at issue, in so far as they were part of the process for completing two impact assessments, belonged to one and the same category of documents.</p>

            <p>Second, in paragraphs 76 to 84 of that judgment, the General Court examined the rules governing the preparation and development of policy proposals by the Commission, which are derived, in particular, from Article 17(1), (2) and (3) TEU. It concluded from that examination that those rules required that institution, when preparing and developing such proposals, to ensure that it acts in a fully independent manner and exclusively in the general interest. It inferred from this that it was, accordingly, necessary to place that institution in a position to act in that manner.</p>

            <p>In paragraphs 94 to 96 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court held that, after the public consultation stage organised by the Commission in the context of the impact assessment procedure with a view to gathering the input of interested parties, that institution had to be able to enjoy space for independent deliberation, temporarily distanced from all forms of external pressure or influence, so as to be able to decide, on the basis of the information gathered in the course of that procedure, in a fully independent manner and in the general interest, on the potential policy initiatives to be proposed. Thus, the Commission's power of initiative should be protected from any influences exerted by public or private interests which would attempt, outside of that consultation, to compel that institution to adopt, amend or abandon an initiative and which would prolong or complicate the discussion taking place within that institution. Impact assessment reports contain a comparison of the various policy options examined by the Commission. Therefore, according to the General Court, the disclosure of those reports, even at the draft stage, and of the opinions given by the Impact Assessment Board concerning those reports, brings with it an increased risk that third parties will attempt, outside of that consultation, to exercise a targeted influence on the policy choices made by that institution. In particular, there is a risk that persons who have participated in that consultation may submit further observations to the Commission regarding the options and situations under consideration, or further criticisms thereof, claiming that their point of view has not been sufficiently or properly taken into account.</p>

            <p>By letter of 2 February 2018, the Commission informed the Court that, on 29 January 2018, it had sent ClientEarth the impact assessment documents regarding inspections and surveillance in environmental matters. According to the Commission, that disclosure followed the adoption by that institution on 18 January 2018 of a communication on actions to improve environmental compliance and governance (COM(2018) 10 final) and of a decision setting up a new group of Commission experts (the Environmental Compliance and Governance Forum) (C(2018) 10 final). The Commission argued that, following that disclosure, ClientEarth had gained access to all the documents at issue, which might prompt the Court to declare, in accordance with Article 149 of its Rules of Procedure, that there is no longer any need to adjudicate on the present appeal.</p>

In the second place, ClientEarth maintained that it had, in any event, retained an interest in having the judgment under appeal set aside and in having the decisions at issue annulled, first, in order to prevent their unlawfulness from recurring in the future and, second, in so far as the Commission had not formally withdrawn those decisions.</p>

            <p>In the second place, as has been emphasised, in essence, by ClientEarth, it was seeking in the present case to gain access to the documents at issue so as, in particular, to make its views known in the Commission's ongoing decision-making processes and to stimulate debate on the actions planned by that institution prior to the Commission making a decision concerning the initiatives envisaged, either by submitting a proposal, where appropriate, or by abandoning those initiatives.</p>

            <p>In the light of the considerations set out in paragraph 37 above and the explanations provided by the Commission at the hearing before the Court, it appears that disclosure of the impact assessment report and of the opinion of the Impact Assessment Board concerning access to justice in environmental matters followed the Commission's decision not to submit a legislative proposal on the matter and to adopt a notice. Concerning the communication to ClientEarth of the impact assessment documents regarding inspections and surveillance in environmental matters, it is apparent from paragraph 38 above that this followed the adoption, by the Commission, of a communication on environmental compliance and governance and of a decision setting up a new group of experts in the field. It therefore seems that disclosure of those various documents did not take place until after the Commission had made a decision regarding the initiatives envisaged. In those circumstances, that disclosure does not appear to have enabled the objectives pursued by ClientEarth in submitting its requests for access to be fully met.</p>

            <p>In the third place, it follows from the case-law of the Court that an applicant may, in certain cases, retain an interest in seeking annulment of the contested act and, as the case may be, the setting aside of the judgment of the General Court dismissing the action brought against that act in order to induce the author of that act to make suitable amendments in the future, and thereby avoid the risk that the unlawfulness alleged in respect of the act in question will be repeated (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 May 2013, Abdulrahim v Council and Commission, C‑239/12 P, EU:C:2013:331, paragraph 63 and the case-law cited). The continuation of that interest presupposes that that unlawfulness is liable to recur in the future, irrespective of the particular circumstances of the case in question (see, to that effect, judgment of 7 June 2007, Wunenburger v Commission, C‑362/05 P, EU:C:2007:322, paragraph 52).</p>

One of the illegalities alleged by ClientEarth is therefore, in essence, the application of that presumption.</p>

Moreover, the risk of the interest being so undermined must be reasonably foreseeable and must not be purely hypothetical (see, to that effect, judgment of 17 October 2013, Council v Access Info Europe, C‑280/11 P, EU:C:2013:671, paragraph 31 and the case-law cited). In certain cases, the Court acknowledged that it was however open to that institution to base its decisions in that regard on general presumptions which apply to certain categories of documents, as considerations of a generally similar kind are likely to apply to requests for disclosure relating to documents of the same nature (judgment of 16 July 2015, ClientEarth v Commission, C‑612/13 P, EU:C:2015:486, paragraph 69 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>The objective of such presumptions is thus the possibility, for the EU institution concerned, to consider that the disclosure of certain categories of documents undermines, in principle, the interest protected by the exception which it is invoking, by relying on such general considerations, without being required to examine specifically and individually each of the documents requested (see, to that effect, judgments of 17 October 2013, Council v Access Info Europe, C‑280/11 P, EU:C:2013:671, paragraph 73, and of 11 May 2017, Sweden v Commission, C‑562/14 P, EU:C:2017:356, paragraph 47 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Accordingly, the general presumption recognised by the General Court in the present case is likely to be implemented again in the future by the Commission in response to new requests for access to documents drawn up in the context of preparing an ongoing impact assessment, a likelihood which, moreover, has not been disputed by that institution.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, ClientEarth is particularly vulnerable to such implementations of that presumption in the future. It is apparent from paragraph 1 of the judgment under appeal that ClientEarth is a non-profit organisation whose aim is the protection of the environment. In that regard, ClientEarth claims, in essence, without being contradicted by the Commission, that one of its tasks is to promote increased transparency and lawfulness in relation to the EU legislative process and that it is therefore likely that it will again request access to documents similar to the documents at issue in the future and that the Commission will once more refuse to grant that request on the basis of that general presumption. ClientEarth would then have to bring a new action for annulment in order to challenge the merits of that presumption.</p>

            <p>Thus, from ClientEarth's perspective, the question of the lawfulness of the general presumption at issue in the present case is relevant in view of future requests for access to such documents (see, by analogy, judgment of 7 June 2007, Wunenburger v Commission, C‑362/05 P, EU:C:2007:322, paragraph 59).</p>

In the present case, there is a specific set of rules applicable to the documents at issue, which contain environmental information, namely the Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters, adopted at Aarhus on 25 June 1998 ( `the Aarhus Convention') and approved on behalf of the European Community by Council Decision 2005/370/EC of 17 February 2005 ( OJ 2005 L 124, p. 1), and by Regulation No 1367/2006.

First, the General Court confuses confidentiality and independence. Indeed, it is opaqueness and not openness which is liable to undermine the Commission's independence. By contrast, openness enhances that independence, by placing the Commission in a position to better resist any external pressures. Second, unless the principle that exceptions to the right of access to documents of the institutions must be interpreted strictly is disregarded, Article 17 TEU cannot constitute a general basis for the Commission to refuse to grant access to such documents.</p>

Contrary to ClientEarth's assertions, those rules do not provide that the Commission is to maintain, in that context, constant multiple dialogues with interested parties. As the General Court correctly recognised in paragraphs 79 to 84 and 96 of the judgment under appeal, it would be impossible in practice for the Commission to have space for independent deliberation and to exercise its power of initiative in a fully independent manner if it were constantly engaged in such dialogues. It would be impossible to preserve the essence of that power if interested parties were to attempt, outside the public consultation organised by that institution, to compel that institution to adopt, amend or abandon an initiative. Moreover, the public interest in understanding its decision-making process should be satisfied by the submission of a proposal or the abandoning of the initiative envisaged, since, in both cases, the final version of all or part of the documents at issue will then be accessible in accordance with the Impact Assessment Guidelines adopted by the Commission on 15 January 2009 ( `the 2009 Guidelines').</p>

Among those exceptions, the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001 provides, inter alia, that access to a document, drawn up by an EU institution for internal use, which relates to a matter where the decision has not been taken by the institution, is to be refused if disclosure of that document would seriously undermine the institution's decision-making process, unless there is an overriding public interest in that disclosure.</p>

Furthermore, as general presumptions constitute an exception to the rule that the EU institution concerned is obliged to carry out a specific and individual examination of every document which is the subject of a request for access and, more generally, to the principle that the public should have the widest possible access to the documents held by the institutions of the European Union, they must be interpreted and applied strictly (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 July 2015, ClientEarth v Commission, C‑612/13 P, EU:C:2015:486, paragraph 81).</p>

            <p>In the first place, it should be borne in mind that recital 6 of Regulation No 1049/2001 indicates that wider access should be granted to documents in cases where the EU institutions are acting in their legislative capacity. The possibility for citizens to scrutinise and be made aware of all the information forming the basis for EU legislative action is a precondition for the effective exercise of their democratic rights as recognised, in particular, in Article 10(3) TEU (see, to that effect, judgments of 1 July 2008, Sweden and Turco v Council, C‑39/05 P and C‑52/05 P, EU:C:2008:374, paragraph 46, and of 17 October 2013, Council v Access Info Europe, C‑280/11 P, EU:C:2013:671, paragraph 33). As is emphasised, in essence, by ClientEarth, the exercise of those rights presupposes not only that those citizens have access to the information at issue so that they may understand the choices made by the EU institutions within the framework of the legislative process, but also that they may have access to that information in good time, at a point that enables them effectively to make their views known regarding those choices.</p>

            <p>In addition, as was emphasised by the Advocate General in points 64 and 65 of his Opinion, it is apparent from Article 12(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001, which implements the principle derived from recital 6 thereof, that not only acts adopted by the EU legislature, but also, more generally, documents drawn up or received in the course of procedures for the adoption of acts which are legally binding in or for the Member States, fall to be described as `legislative documents' and, consequently, subject to Articles 4 and 9 of that regulation, must be made directly accessible.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it is true that, as was noted by the General Court in paragraph 103 of the judgment under appeal, when the Commission prepares impact assessment documents, such as the documents at issue, it does not itself act in a legislative capacity. In addition, the impact assessment procedure takes place upstream of the legislative procedure sensu stricto, which does not formally begin until a legislative proposal is submitted by the Commission.</p>

            <p>That being said, it should be noted that, pursuant to Article 17(2) TEU, EU legislative acts may only be adopted on the basis of a Commission proposal, except where the Treaties provide otherwise. The power of initiative accorded to that institution by that provision includes, first, the power to decide whether or not to submit a proposal, except in the situations where that institution is obliged to submit such a proposal. In particular, the Commission's decision to abandon, following an impact assessment, the legislative initiative envisaged puts a definitive end to the planned legislative action, which may not be resumed unless that institution withdraws that decision. Second, the Commission's power of initiative includes the power to determine the subject matter, objective and content of a potential proposal, bearing in mind that, under Article 293(1) TFEU, except in the cases referred to in that provision, where, pursuant to the Treaties, the Council acts on a proposal from the Commission, it may amend that proposal only by acting unanimously (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 April 2015, Council v Commission, C‑409/13, EU:C:2015:217, paragraphs 70 and 72).</p>

It is on the basis of that information that the Commission will be able to assess the appropriateness, the necessity, the nature and the content of such initiatives. Specifically, impact assessment reports contain a presentation of the various policy options under consideration, the study of the impact, advantages and disadvantages of those options, and a comparison of those options. Although those guidelines state that impact assessments are not to replace the taking of a decision by the Commission, it is apparent from paragraph 9 of that judgment that that institution indicated, in the decisions at issue, that the policy choices made in its legislative proposals were supported by the content of those assessments.</p>

            <p>Although the submission of a legislative proposal by the Commission is, at the impact assessment stage, uncertain, the disclosure of those documents is likely to increase the transparency and openness of the legislative process as a whole, in particular the preparatory steps of that process, and, thus, to enhance the democratic nature of the European Union by enabling its citizens to scrutinise that information and to attempt to influence that process. As is asserted, in essence, by ClientEarth, such a disclosure, at a time when the Commission's decision-making process is still ongoing, enables citizens to understand the options envisaged and the choices made by that institution and, thus, to be aware of the considerations underlying the legislative action of the European Union. In addition, that disclosure puts those citizens in a position effectively to make their views known regarding those choices before those choices have been definitively adopted, so far as both the Commission's decision to submit a legislative proposal and the content of that proposal, on which the legislative action of the European Union depends, are concerned.</p>

            <p>It follows that, as was noted by the Advocate General in points 67 and 68 of his Opinion, such documents, in view of their purpose, are among those covered by Article 12(2) of Regulation No 1049/2001.</p>

            <p>Moreover, the importance for citizens of being able to have access to documents drawn up in the context of an impact assessment, even if the Commission's decision-making process is still ongoing, is not called into question by the fact, emphasised by that institution, that, in this instance, ClientEarth had had the possibility to take part in the public consultations organised by that institution in the context of the impact assessment procedures at issue in the present case and that a certain number of documents relating to those assessments were already publicly available at the time the decisions at issue were adopted. Although such consultations are also intended to ensure the openness of the Commission's decision-making process and the participation of citizens in that process, they are not to replace the possibility for those citizens to be granted access, upon request, to impact assessment reports and to the opinions of the Impact Assessment Board. Indeed, it is apparent from the 2009 Guidelines that consultations organised by the Commission are not necessarily to be open to the public as a whole. In addition, it is not established in the present case that the information disclosed in the context of those consultations and the information contained in the documents that were already publicly available corresponded, in essence, to the information set out in the documents at issue.</p>

As is asserted by ClientEarth, such access should therefore also be granted in respect of those documents.</p>

In that regard, it is apparent from paragraph 90 above that impact assessment reports contain, inter alia, the study of the impact, advantages and disadvantages of the various policy options envisaged by the Commission with a view to the potential adoption of an initiative, whether legislative or otherwise.

            <p>In order to recognise the existence of a general presumption of confidentiality in respect of documents drawn up in the context of an impact assessment for as long as the Commission has not made a decision regarding a potential proposal, in paragraphs 94 to 96 of the judgment under appeal the General Court relied, as has been recalled in paragraph 26 above, on general considerations based, in essence, on the need to preserve the Commission's space for deliberation and its ability to exercise its power of initiative in a fully independent manner and exclusively in the general interest in accordance with Article 17(1), (2) and (3) TEU, on the one hand, and the risk that disclosure of documents drawn up in the context of an impact assessment relating to an ongoing decision-making process might give rise to external pressures or influences liable to have an adverse effect on the way in which that institution's decision-making process is conducted, on the other.</p>

            <p>However, in the first place, although the Commission must, under Article 17(1), (2) and (3) TEU, act in a fully independent manner and exclusively in the general interest when carrying out impact assessments, it should be noted that the impact assessment procedure is not a type of procedure which, as such, has features that preclude, in principle, full transparency being granted. On the contrary, as was stated by the General Court in paragraph 93 of the judgment under appeal, that procedure is conducted with the objective of ensuring that the Commission's decision-making process is transparent and open. It follows from paragraphs 84 to 101 above that the same must apply a fortiori where that procedure is part, as in the present case, of a legislative process in respect of environmental matters.</p>

            <p>In addition, as is argued, in essence, by ClientEarth, by increasing the legitimacy of the Commission's decision-making process, transparency ensures the credibility of that institution's action in the minds of citizens and concerned organisations and thus specifically contributes to ensuring that that institution acts in a fully independent manner and exclusively in the general interest. It is rather a lack of public information and debate which is likely to give rise to doubts as to whether that institution has fulfilled its tasks in a fully independent manner and exclusively in the general interest (see, to that effect, judgment of 1 July 2008, Sweden and Turco v Council, C‑39/05 P and C‑52/05 P, EU:C:2008:374, paragraph 59).</p>

            <p>In the second place, as is maintained by ClientEarth and the Member States intervening in support of that party, none of the grounds relied on by the General Court in paragraphs 94 to 96 of the judgment under appeal permits a finding of a risk that the Commission's ongoing decision-making process could be undermined for the purposes of the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001. By recognising, on the basis of such grounds, a general presumption of confidentiality in respect of documents drawn up in the context of an impact assessment for as long as the Commission has not made a decision regarding a potential proposal, the General Court infringed that provision and the principle that it must be interpreted and applied strictly, which, as has been recalled in paragraph 101 above, is particularly relevant as regards documents drawn up in the course of a legislative process and containing environmental information.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it is true that it cannot be ruled out, as the General Court explained in paragraph 96 of the judgment under appeal, in the event of disclosure of impact assessment reports and the opinions of the Impact Assessment Board regarding those reports before the Commission has made a decision regarding a potential proposal, that third parties may attempt to influence or exert pressure on the policy choices to be made by that institution or that interested parties who have submitted observations during the public consultation organised by the Commission in the context of the impact assessment procedure may submit further remarks regarding the options and scenarios under consideration by that institution, or further criticisms thereof.</p>

            <p>However, in so far as the Commission, in essence, argued that, in the event of such disclosure, it would be constantly engaged in multiple dialogues with interested parties, so that it would be impossible in practice for it to have space for autonomous deliberation and to make a decision in a fully independent manner regarding the potential proposals to be adopted, it should be noted that EU law does not, in principle, require that institution to maintain such dialogues in individual cases, which was expressly acknowledged by that institution at the hearing before the Court. In that regard, although Article 11(2) TEU provides that the EU institutions are to maintain an open, transparent and regular dialogue with representative associations and civil society, that provision in no way means that the Commission is required to respond, on the merits and in each individual case, to the remarks it may have received following disclosure of a document under Regulation No 1049/2001.</p>

            <p>In addition and in any event, the General Court has not established that the external influences or pressures to which the Commission might be subjected in the event of disclosure of documents developed in the context of an impact assessment relating to an ongoing decision-making process would be such as to risk, generally and regardless of the specific context surrounding the impact assessment and decision-making process in question and of the specific content of each of the documents requested, impeding that institution's capacity to act in a fully independent manner and exclusively in the general interest or seriously to affect, prolong or complicate the proper conduct of that institution's internal discussions and decision-making process. As is asserted, in essence, by ClientEarth, the general considerations set out in that regard by the General Court in paragraphs 94 to 96 of the judgment under appeal cannot amount to such a risk. In that regard, as can be seen from paragraphs 92 and 98 above, the expression by the public or the interested parties of their views on the choices made and the policy options envisaged by the Commission in the context of its initiatives, in particular its legislative initiatives in respect of environmental matters, before that institution has made a decision regarding the planned initiative, is an integral part of the exercise by EU citizens of their democratic rights.</p>

            <p>It follows that, although the Commission must be able to enjoy a space for deliberation in order to be able to decide as to the policy choices to be made and the potential proposals to be submitted, the General Court was wrong to consider, in essence, that the protection of the Commission's power of initiative and the preservation of that institution's ability to exercise that power in a fully independent manner and exclusively in the general interest required, in principle, that documents drawn up in the context of an impact assessment may, generally, remain confidential until that institution has made such a decision.</p>

            <p>Moreover, in so far as the Commission, at the hearing before the Court, relied on the fact that the documents at issue were only internal, unfinalised drafts, it should be emphasised that, as that institution itself recalled in its response, in order to recognise the general presumption at issue, the General Court did not rely specifically on that fact or on the need to protect the process connected with the drafting of those documents. Indeed, it is apparent from paragraphs 94 to 97 of the judgment under appeal that the General Court, to that end, held more generally that there was a risk that disclosure of impact assessment reports, whether or not they were at the draft stage, and of opinions of the Impact Assessment Board would seriously undermine the Commission's ongoing decision-making process connected with the development and adoption of its proposals.</p>

However, that provision does not, either by its wording or by reference to the interest that it protects, rule out the possibility of requesting access to documents of a provisional nature. Second, that provisional nature is not, as such, capable of establishing, generally and independently of a specific and individual examination of each of the documents requested, a risk that the Commission's decision-making process would be seriously undermined. Indeed, such a risk depends on factors such as the state of completion of the document in question and the precise stage of the decision-making process in question at the time when access to that document is refused, the specific context in which that process takes place, and the issues still to be discussed internally by the institution concerned.</p>

Concerning the impact assessment documents regarding access to justice in environmental matters, it also emphasised the sensitive nature of the issues involved and the existence of possible differences of opinion between Member States.

            <p>Although, in its statements in defence at first instance, the Commission argued that it could not be required to disclose to the public the impact assessment reports at the preliminary draft stage and possible subsequent amendments thereto, it follows from the considerations set out in paragraph 111 above that the provisional nature of a document is also not capable, as such, of demonstrating that risk. The Commission has not established, in detail, the reasons why, taking into account, in particular, the precise stage of the impact assessment procedures at issue in the present case and having regard to the specific issues yet to be discussed internally when the decisions at issue were adopted, disclosure of each of the documents at issue, taken in isolation, would have seriously undermined its ongoing decision-making processes.</p>

          <content eId="para_19045__content">
            <p>In that regard, the argument put forward by the Commission that there is a risk that the disclosure, before the end of the impact assessment procedure, of those documents to certain interested parties, who would attempt to influence the works of that institution, would lead to the interests of those parties being over-represented and having a disproportionate influence and would thus distort that institution's decision-making process, cannot succeed. Indeed, it is for the Commission to ensure that such a situation is prevented, not by refusing to grant access to those documents, but by taking into consideration all the interests involved, including those of persons or interest groups who have not requested such access. That institution's argument that it would not be in the public interest to have access to different versions of draft impact assessment reports and subsequent amendments thereto on the ground that such access would spread confusion among the addressees of those documents must also be rejected. Although it cannot be excluded that such a fact, assuming it to be established, may be taken into account in order to rule out the existence of an overriding public interest in disclosure of the document concerned, it is nonetheless not such as to demonstrate the risk of the Commission's decision-making process being seriously undermined. The question whether such an interest exists does not arise where that risk is not established.</p>

            <p>Second, the Commission did not establish, in the decisions at issue, how the importance of the issues dealt with in the documents at issue and the fact that those issues have been the subject of deliberations for some time mean that disclosure of those documents would seriously undermine its ongoing decision-making processes.</p>

            <p>Third, concerning the Commission's arguments based on the sensitive nature of those issues and of the ongoing negotiations and the existence of possible differences of opinion between Member States, those arguments are completely unsubstantiated and remain too abstract to establish such a risk, with the result that they cannot succeed.</p>

            <p>Fourth, regarding the grounds based on the need to shield the discussion from external influencing factors, they must, having regard to the considerations set out in paragraphs 106 to 109 above, be rejected. In addition, the Commission has not explained how such an influence could, as it contends, affect the quality of control exercised over the Member States.</p>

            <p>It follows from the foregoing that the Commission infringed the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001 by refusing to disclose the documents at issue on the basis of that provision. Accordingly, the decisions at issue must be annulled, without it being necessary to examine the other arguments raised by ClientEarth in support of its actions for annulment.</p>

            <p>Under Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is well founded and the Court itself gives final judgment in the case, the Court is to make a decision as to the costs.
