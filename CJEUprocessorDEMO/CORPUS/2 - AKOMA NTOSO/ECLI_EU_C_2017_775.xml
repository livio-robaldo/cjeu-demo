            <p>Paper Consult appealed against that judgment to the Curtea de Apel Cluj (Court of Appeal, Cluj, Romania). It did not contest the factual evidence relied on by the tax authorities and by the Tribunalul Bistrița-Năsăud (High Court, Bistrița-Năsăud). However, it claimed that it had not received any communication regarding the decision of the President of the NAFA of 21 September 2010 declaring Rom Packaging inactive, but that that decision had merely been displayed at the NAFA's headquarters and published on its website. Paper Consult maintained that, in those circumstances, that decision was not enforceable against it and could not be regarded as constituting the basis of the refusal to grant it its right to deduct VAT, as such a measure was contrary to EU law.</p>

According to that court, it is not an excessive burden for taxpayers to carry out a basic check, on the NAFA's website, of the persons with whom they intend to enter into a contract, in order to determine whether or not they have been declared `inactive taxpayers'.

Moreover, the non-payment of VAT affects the sales price of the goods and services and confers on the seller a competitive advantage which increases the volume of sales, with the result that the imposition of financial penalties is insufficient to combat VAT evasion.</p>

Furthermore, there is a direct link between the collection of VAT revenue in compliance with the applicable EU law and the availability to the European Union budget of the corresponding VAT resources, since any lacuna in the collection of the first potentially causes a reduction in the second (see judgment of 26 February 2013, Åkerberg Fransson, C‑617/10, EU:C:2013:105, paragraph 26).</p>

Furthermore, it is apparent from the material submitted to the Court that, subject to the checks to be carried out by the referring court, even if the taxpayer has regularised its situation and succeeded in being removed from the list of taxpayers registered as inactive, the penalty laid down in Article 11(1 2) of the Tax Code would remain, with the result that the purchaser of the goods or service cannot recover the right to deduct VAT. By contrast, Article 11(1 1) of the Tax Code provides that the `re-activated' taxpayer is authorised, after its `re-activation', to recover the VAT in respect of which it has been refused a right of deduction during the period of inactivity.</p>

            <p>In this regard, the Romanian Government indicated that the legislation had been modified and that, since 1 January 2017, in the case where a taxpayer declared inactive has been re-activated, the tax effects of the inactivation are annulled, both for the taxpayer concerned and for its commercial partners, which recover the right to deduct VAT relating to the transactions carried out during the period of inactivity.</p>

            <p>According to Paper Consult, Rom Packaging paid to the public purse the VAT received by reason of the contract concluded with Paper Consult. In response to a question put by the Court, the Romanian Government confirmed that amounts corresponding to the VAT owed by Rom Packaging had indeed been paid, but that it was not possible to verify that those amounts related to the transactions concluded between the two companies since Rom Packaging had not submitted its final VAT statement.</p>

            <p>Subject to the checks to be undertaken by the referring court, the fact remains that Article 11(1 2) of the Tax Code, in the version applicable to the facts in the main proceedings, does not provide for a regularisation in favour of the downstream taxable person despite evidence that VAT has been paid by the upstream taxable person, as the non-recognition of the right to deduct is final.</p>

            <p>However, the impossibility, for the taxable person, to demonstrate that the transactions concluded with the trader declared inactive meet the conditions laid down by Directive 2006/112 and, in particular, that the VAT has been paid into the public purse by that trader, goes beyond what is necessary to attain the legitimate objective pursued by that directive.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, the answer to the questions referred is that Directive 2006/112 must be interpreted as precluding national rules, such as those at issue in the main proceedings, under which the right to deduct VAT is refused to a taxable person on the ground that the trader which supplied a service to that taxable person and issued a corresponding invoice, on which the expenditure and the VAT are indicated separately, has been declared inactive by the tax authorities of a Member State, that declaration of inactivity being public and accessible on the internet to any taxable person in that State, in the case where that refusal of the right to deduct is systematic and final, making it impossible to adduce evidence that there was no tax evasion or loss of tax revenue.</p>

            <p>In support of its request, that government relies on, in the first place, its good faith, resulting from objective doubts concerning the scope of the Court's case-law and from the follow-up to an `EU Pilot' procedure concerning the national rules at issue in the main proceedings, in the context of which, on the basis of the Romanian authorities' response, the Commission had decided not to pursue the matter, which led those authorities to believe that those rules were compatible with EU law. Secondly, the Romanian Government highlights the serious financial consequences that would arise if, following the Court's judgment, VAT deductions had to be granted to all traders who had concluded transactions with traders declared inactive since 2007.</p>

            <p>In this connection, it should be recalled that, according to settled case-law of the Court, the interpretation which, in the exercise of the jurisdiction conferred on it by Article 267 TFEU, the Court gives to a rule of EU law clarifies and defines the meaning and scope of that rule as it must be or ought to have been understood and applied from the time of its entry into force. It follows that the rule, as thus interpreted, may, and must, be applied by the courts even to legal relationships which arose and were established before the judgment ruling on the request for interpretation, provided that in other respects the conditions for bringing a dispute relating to the application of that rule before the courts having jurisdiction are satisfied (see judgments of 10 May 2012, Santander Asset Management SGIIC and Others, C‑338/11 to C‑347/11, EU:C:2012:286, paragraph 58, and of 22 September 2016, Microsoft Mobile Sales International and Others, C‑110/15, EU:C:2016:717, paragraph 59).</p>

            <p>It is only quite exceptionally that the Court may, in application of the general principle of legal certainty inherent in the EU legal order, be moved to restrict for any person concerned the opportunity to rely on a provision which it has interpreted with a view to calling into question legal relationships established in good faith. Two essential criteria must be fulfilled before such a limitation can be imposed, namely that those concerned should have acted in good faith and that there should be a risk of serious difficulties (judgments of 10 May 2012, Santander Asset Management SGIIC and Others, C‑338/11 to C‑347/11, EU:C:2012:286, paragraph 59, and of 22 September 2016, Microsoft Mobile Sales International and Others, C‑110/15, EU:C:2016:717, paragraph 60).</p>

          <content eId="para_1113__content">
            <p>More specifically, the Court has taken that step only in quite specific circumstances, notably where there was a risk of serious economic repercussions owing in particular to the large number of legal relationships entered into in good faith on the basis of rules considered to be validly in force and where it appeared that individuals and national authorities had been led to adopt practices which did not comply with EU law by reason of objective, significant uncertainty regarding the implications of European Union provisions, to which the conduct of other Member States or the Commission may even have contributed (judgments of 10 May 2012, Santander Asset Management SGIIC and Others, C‑338/11 to C‑347/11, EU:C:2012:286, paragraph 60, and of 22 September 2016, Microsoft Mobile Sales International and Others, C‑110/15, EU:C:2016:717, paragraph 61).</p>

            <p>With regard to the doubts highlighted by the Romanian Government relating to the interpretation of EU Law, it must be noted that a refusal to allow taxable persons to exercise the right to deduct VAT constitutes an exception to a fundamental principle of the common system of VAT, the legality of which, according to settled case-law, is acknowledged only in exceptional circumstances.</p>

            <p>The Commission's closure of an `EU Pilot' procedure has no bearing on this analysis. The closure of such an informal procedure, which is not in any way governed by the provisions of the Treaties, but involves voluntary cooperation between the Commission and the Member States, designed generally both to ensure the correct application of EU law and to resolve, at an early stage, issues arising from that application, does not in any way prejudge the Commission's ability to institute formal proceedings for failure to fulfil an obligation under Article 258 TFEU. In any event, the Commission's attitude can in no way, as such, give rise to a legitimate expectation on the part of a Member State as to the compliance of its national rules with EU law where, as in the present case, it is apparent from the case-law that there is no objective and significant uncertainty as to the scope of EU law, in particular the provisions of Directive 2006/112.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules: Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax must be interpreted as precluding national rules, such as those at issue in the main proceedings, under which the right to deduct value added tax is refused to a taxable person on the ground that the trader which supplied a service to that taxable person and issued a corresponding invoice, on which the expenditure and the value added tax are indicated separately, has been declared inactive by the tax authorities of a Member State, that declaration of inactivity being public and accessible on the internet to any taxable person in that State, in the case where that refusal of the right to deduct is systematic and final, making it impossible to adduce evidence that there was no tax evasion or loss of tax revenue.</p>
