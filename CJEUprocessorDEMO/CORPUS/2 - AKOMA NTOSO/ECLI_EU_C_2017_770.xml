            <p>On 30 March 2015, the Nemzeti Adó- és Vámhivatal (National Tax and Customs Authority, Hungary) carried out an inspection in the vicinity of Nagylak (Hungary), near the border with Romania, on a coupled combination of vehicles with a maximum laden weight of more than 12 tonnes, registered in Turkey and operated by Istanbul Lojistik. That company held a Hungarian-Turkish transit licence for the heavy goods vehicle concerned, which it was using to transport textiles from Turkey to Germany via Hungary as State of transit. The transit licence contained all the information required under the Hungarian rules but the revenue stamp for the amount of motor vehicle tax required, which showed that that tax had been paid, had not been affixed to the licence.</p>

            <p>By administrative decisions of 31 March 2015, adopted after that inspection, the national tax and customs authority declared that Istanbul Lojistik had not complied with its obligation to pay tax under the Law on Motor Vehicle Tax and, therefore, its transit licence was not valid. That authority required Istanbul Lojistik to pay the sum of HUF 60000 (approximately EUR 200) in respect of that tax, together with a tax penalty of HUF 300000 (approximately EUR 1000) and an administrative fine in the same amount, amounting to a total of HUF 660000 (approximately EUR 2200).</p>

            <p>In support of its action, Istanbul Lojistik claims that the provisions of the Law on Motor Vehicle Tax at issue infringe Articles 4 to 6 of Decision No 1/95 of the Association Council. It submits that the motor vehicle tax may be regarded as a charge having equivalent effect to a customs duty within the meaning of Article 30 TFEU and, therefore, of Article 4 of the decision. In its view, that tax is levied in a manner that is both discriminatory and protective and constitutes a restriction on the free movement of goods that is contrary to EU law.</p>

            <p>Article 66 of Decision No 1/95 of the Association Council provides that the provisions of the decision, in so far as they are identical in substance to the corresponding provisions of the EC Treaty, now the FEU Treaty, are to be interpreted in conformity with the relevant decisions of the Court of Justice. Since Article 4 of the decision is identical in substance to Article 30 TFEU, it must be interpreted in conformity with the case-law of the Court concerning the latter provision.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, it should be noted that any pecuniary charge, however small and whatever its designation and mode of application, which is imposed unilaterally on goods by reason of the fact that they cross a frontier, and which is not a customs duty in the strict sense, constitutes a charge having equivalent effect within the meaning of Articles 28 and 30 TFEU (judgments of 18 January 2007, Brzeziński, C‑313/05, EU:C:2007:33, paragraph 22 and the case-law cited, and of 2 October 2014, Orgacom, C‑254/13, EU:C:2014:2251, paragraph 23). The justification for the prohibition of charges having an effect equivalent to customs duties lies in the fact that those charges constitute an obstacle to the movement of goods, in that they artificially increase the price of imported or exported goods in relation to domestic products (judgment of 21 March 1991, Commission v Italy, C‑209/89, EU:C:1991:139, paragraph 7).</p>

            <p>It should also be observed that the grounds for justification listed in Article 36 TFUE apply exclusively to measures having equivalent effect to a quantitative restriction and not to charges having equivalent effect to a customs duty (see, inter alia, judgment of 14 June 1988, Dansk Denkavit, 29/87, EU:C:1988:299, paragraph 32).</p>

            <p>Moreover, the Customs Union necessarily entails the free movement of goods between the Member States. That freedom could not itself be complete if it were possible for the Member States to impede or interfere in any way with the movement of goods in transit. It is thereof necessary, as a consequence of the Customs Union and in the mutual interest of the Member States, to acknowledge the existence of a general principle of freedom of transit of goods within the European Union (judgment of 21 June 2007, Commission v Italy, C‑173/05, EU:C:2007:362, paragraph 31 and the case-law cited). Indeed, the Member States would contravene that principle if they were to apply to goods in transit through their territory transit duties or other charges imposed in respect of transit (judgment of 16 March 1983, SIOT, 266/81, EU:C:1983:77, paragraph 19).</p>

Indeed, such a charge is imposed on products, even where it has been levied on the transport of goods or the use of roads and has first to be paid by the person operating the heavy goods vehicle (see, to that effect, judgment of 17 July 1997, Haahr Petroleum, C‑90/94, EU:C:1997:368, paragraph 38).</p>

            <p>In the present case, the Law on Motor Vehicle Tax at issue in the main proceedings provides that the motor vehicle tax must be paid, with regard to heavy goods vehicles registered in third countries, at the time of entry into Hungarian territory, in respect of both the outward and the return journey.

            <p>Accordingly, the Court finds that, in the light of the case-law cited in paragraphs 40 to 43 above, even though the motor vehicle tax is not levied on products as such, it is imposed on the goods transported by vehicles registered in a third country, in particular Turkey, when they cross the Hungarian border, and not, as submitted by the Hungarian and Italian Governments, on the transport service.</p>
