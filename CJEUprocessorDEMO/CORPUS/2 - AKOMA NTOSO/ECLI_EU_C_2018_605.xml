            <p>On 3 August 2016, Ms Guigo applied to the Guarantee Fund for payment of the claims corresponding to the remunerations which remained unpaid by Evrosilex. That application was based on the Law on employees' guaranteed claims, the judicial decision of the Rayonen sad Varna (Varna District Court) of 26 June 2013, and the writ of execution issued on the basis of that judicial decision. Since the Guarantee Fund failed to respond within the statutory period, Ms Guigo contested that implicit refusal before the Administrativen sad Varna (Varna Administrative Court, Bulgaria).</p>

            <p>That court notes that the dispute in the main proceedings raises the question whether, in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, Article 4(1) of the Law on employees' guaranteed claims negates the full effect of Articles 151 and 153 TFEU, together with Articles 3 and 4 of Directive 2008/94, inasmuch as that national provision could be considered to constitute an obstacle to an employee entitled to guaranteed claims being able to benefit from a minimum level of protection.</p>

          <content eId="para_18318__content">
            <p>It raises the question, more specifically, whether EU law allows the adoption of a provision, such as Article 4(1) of the Law on employees' guaranteed claims which, where the employer is declared insolvent, excludes from the entitlement to minimum protection of guaranteed claims those arising from an employment relationship terminated, automatically and absolutely, more than three months previously. The referring court points out that Directive 2008/94 makes no provision for the option of restricting the category of persons who have standing as employees and outstanding wage claims against the insolvent employer, with the exception of the specific category of persons excluded from protection by virtue of the presumption under Article 12 of that directive.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the referring court queries whether the period of two months in which applications for payment of guaranteed claims may be made, provided for by Article 25 of the Law on employees' guaranteed claims, and which begins to run from the date of entry in the commercial register of the judicial decision initiating insolvency proceedings, ensures a sufficient level of protection for employees, and whether that period excessively restricts the exercise of the rights which those employees derive from Directive 2008/94. The referring court states, in that regard, that the Employment Code provides for a period of three years in which an action for payment of wage claims may be brought, a period which runs from the date on which that debt ought to have been discharged by the employer; and that, although those two national laws govern situations that are different in nature, they nevertheless pursue a common objective, namely the protection of employees' wage claims.</p>

            <p>The referring court is unsure, moreover, as to the compatibility of Article 25 of the Law on employees' guaranteed claims with Articles 3 and 4 of Directive 2008/94 and the principles of proportionality and effectiveness, on account of the fact that that provision is automatically applicable without any possibility of an individual assessment of the relevant factors.</p>

            <p>Lastly, the referring court states that it entertains doubts as to the compatibility with Article 20 of the Charter of the difference in treatment of employees who are entitled to the protection of their outstanding claims, depending on whether Article 358(1)(3) of the Employment Code or Article 4(1) of the Law on employees' guaranteed claims applies, and depending on whether or not the employer is solvent.</p>

                <p>Are Articles 151 and 153 TFEU and Articles 3, 4, 11 and 12 of Directive [2008/94] to be interpreted as permitting a national provision such as Article 4(1) of the [Law on employees' guaranteed claims], under which persons whose employment was terminated prior to the three-month period provided for before registration of the decision initiating insolvency proceedings in respect of the employer are excluded from the protection of outstanding wage claims?</p>

                <p>If the first question is answered affirmatively, is the procedural autonomy of the Member States, in the light of the principles of equivalence, effectiveness and proportionality in the context of the social objective underpinning Articles 151 and 153 TFEU and Directive 2008/94, to be construed as permitting a national measure, such as Article 25 of the [Law on employees' guaranteed claims], which provides that, on expiry of a period of two months from the date of registration of the judicial decision initiating insolvency proceedings, the rights to assert and obtain satisfaction of guaranteed claims are extinguished if the domestic law of the Member State contains a provision, such as Article 358(1)(3) of the Employment Code, under which the period for asserting outstanding wage claims is three years from the date on which the claim ought to have been met and payments made after expiry of this period are not deemed to have been made without a legal basis?</p>

                <p>Is Article 20 of the [Charter] to be interpreted as permitting such a distinction to be made, on the one hand, between employees with outstanding claims whose employment was terminated before the three-month period before registration of the judicial decision initiating insolvency proceedings in respect of the employer and employees whose employment was terminated during the three-month period laid down and, on the other hand, between those employees and employees who, under Article 358(1)(3) of the Employment Code, are entitled on the termination of their employment to protection of their outstanding claims during a period of three years commencing at the time when the claim ought to have been met?</p>

                <p>Is Article 4, read with Article 3, of Directive 2008/94 and with the principle of proportionality, to be interpreted as permitting a provision, such as Article 25 of the [Law on employees' guaranteed claims], under which the rights to assert and to obtain satisfaction of guaranteed claims are automatically extinguished, without any possibility of an individual assessment of the relevant factors, on expiry of a two-month period from the date of registration of the judicial decision initiating insolvency proceedings?'</p>

                <p>25 As a preliminary point, it should be noted that, inasmuch as Directive 2008/94 is based on Article 137(2) EC, now Article 153 TFEU, and was adopted for the purpose of achieving the objectives referred to in Article 151 TFEU, the interpretation of the provisions of that directive alone is necessary in order to answer the first question.</p>

            <p>Thus, the Court considers that, by its first question, the referring court is asking, in essence, whether Directive 2008/94 must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as Article 4(1) of the Law on employees' guaranteed claims, which does not guarantee the wage claims of employees whose employment relationship ended more than three months prior to the entry in the commercial register the judicial decision initiating insolvency proceedings in respect of their employer.</p>

            <p>Pursuant to Article 1(1) of Directive 2008/94, the latter is to apply to employees' claims arising from contracts of employment or employment relationships and existing against employers who are in a state of insolvency.</p>

            <p>According to the Court's well-established case-law, the social objective of that directive is to guarantee employees a minimum of protection at EU level in the event of the employer's insolvency through payment of outstanding claims resulting from contracts of employment or employment relationships and relating to pay for a specific period (judgments of 28 November 2013, Gomes Viana Novo and Others, C‑309/12, EU:C:2013:774, paragraph 20, and of 2 March 2017, Eschenbrenner, C‑496/15, EU:C:2017:152, paragraph 52 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It is in the light of that objective that Article 3 of the directive requires Member States to take the measures necessary to ensure that national guarantee institutions guarantee payment of employees' outstanding claims.</p>

            <p>However, as the Court has already noted, Directive 2008/94 confers on the Member States the power to limit the payment obligation by fixing a reference period or a guarantee period and/or setting ceilings on payments (see, by analogy with Directive 80/987, judgment of 28 November 2013, Gomes Viana Novo and Others, C‑309/12, EU:C:2013:774, paragraph 22, and order of 10 April 2014, Macedo Maia and Others, C‑511/12, not published, EU:C:2014:268, paragraph 21).</p>

            <p>According to the case-law of the Court, the provisions of Directive 2008/94 concerning the power available to Member States to limit their guarantee demonstrate that the system established by that directive takes account of the financial capacity of those Member States and seeks to preserve the financial stability of their guarantee institutions (see, by analogy, judgment of 28 November 2013, Gomes Viana Novo and Others, C‑309/12, EU:C:2013:774, paragraph 29, and order of 10 April 2014, Macedo Maia and Others, C‑511/12, not published, EU:C:2014:268, paragraph 21).</p>

            <p>Thus, on the one hand, the second paragraph of Article 3 of Directive 2008/94 provides that the claims taken over by the guarantee institution are to be the outstanding pay claims relating to a period prior to and/or, as applicable, after a given date determined by the Member States.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, under Article 4(1) of Directive 2008/94, the Member States are to have the option to limit the liability of the guarantee institutions referred to in Article 3. According to Article 4(2) of the same directive, if Member States exercise that option, they are to specify the length of the period for which outstanding claims are to be met by the guarantee institution, which may not be shorter than a period covering the remuneration of the last three months of the employment relationship prior to and/or after the date referred to in the second paragraph of Article 3. Those provisions also give Member States the option of including that minimum period of three months in reference period which may not be shorter than six months, and of providing for a minimum guarantee limited to eight weeks, provided that that eight-week period is within a longer reference period of at least 18 months (see, by analogy, judgment of 28 November 2013, Gomes Viana Novo and Others, C‑309/12, EU:C:2013:774, paragraph 26).</p>

            <p>It should be noted that the cases in which it is permitted to limit the payment obligation of the guarantee institutions, as laid down in Article 4 of Directive 2008/94, must be interpreted strictly (see, by analogy, judgments of 17 November 2011, van Ardennen, C‑435/10, EU:C:2011:751, paragraph 34, and of 28 November 2013, Gomes Viana Novo and Others, C‑309/12, EU:C:2013:774, paragraph 31). However, such a restrictive interpretation cannot deprive of its effectiveness the option expressly conferred on Member States to limit that payment obligation (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 November 2013, Gomes Viana Novo and Others, C‑309/12, EU:C:2013:774, paragraph 32).</p>

            <p>In the present case, in accordance with the second paragraph of Article 3 of Directive 2008/94 that Article 6 of the Law on employees' guaranteed claims fixed as the reference date the date of entry in the commercial register of the judicial decision initiating insolvency proceedings. Furthermore, it is not apparent from the file available to the Court that the Republic of Bulgaria has exercised the option provided for in the second and third subparagraphs of Article 4(2) of that directive to fix a reference period, for the purposes of that provision.</p>

            <p>Under Article 4(1) and the first subparagraph of Article 4(2) of the same directive, the Member States have the option to limit the liability of the guarantee institutions, where the employment relationship ended prior to that reference date, by covering only employees whose employment relationship ended in the three months preceding that date, as provided for under Article 4(1) of the Law on employees' guaranteed claims. The exclusion of employees whose employment relationship ended prior to that period does not infringe the minimum protection provided for in the first subparagraph of Article 4(2) of Directive 2008/94, since those employees do not have, in connection to the insolvent employer, any outstanding claims resulting from their employment contract or employment relationship arising over the course of the three months preceding that reference date.</p>

On those grounds, the Court (Seventh Chamber) hereby rules: Directive 2008/94/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 October 2008 on the protection of employees in the event of the insolvency of their employer must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation, such as Article 4(1) of the Zakon za garantiranite vzemania na rabotnitsite i sluzhitelite pri nesastoyatelnost na rabotodatelia (Law on employees' guaranteed claims in the event of the employer's insolvency), which does not guarantee the wage claims of employees whose employment relationship ended more than three months prior to the entry in the commercial register of the judicial decision initiating insolvency proceedings in respect of their employer.</p>
