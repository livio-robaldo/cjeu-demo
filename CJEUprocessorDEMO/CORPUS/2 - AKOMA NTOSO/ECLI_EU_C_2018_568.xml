            <p>Iveco Orecchia brought an action for annulment of the decision awarding the contract to VAR before the Tribunale amministrativo regionale per la Lombardia (Regional Administrative Court, Lombardy, Italy), which upheld the action. That court thereby annulled the decision on the ground, inter alia, that VAR had not, either when it submitted its tender or during the procurement procedure, provided proof that the products which it offered were equivalent to the original spare parts. VAR, supported by ATM, appealed against that judgment to the Consiglio di Stato (Council of State, Italy).

            <p>The Consiglio di Stato (Council of State) points out that neither the wording of the specific rules governing the procurement procedure nor that of Article 68(13) of Legislative Decree No 163/2006 provides that the proof that the product is equivalent to the original must be provided by the tenderer at the time of the call for tenders. In that regard, Article 68(13) of Legislative Decree No 163/2006, which transposes Article 34(8) of Directive 2004/17 into national law, is to be distinguished from the case in which the contracting authority defines the products which are the subject matter of the tender in accordance with Article 68(3) of that legislative decree, namely, where the tenderer is required to prove at the tendering stage that the solutions which it proposes satisfy in an equivalent manner the requirements defined by the technical specifications. In addition, that court points out that account should also be taken of the technical specifications in the contract documentation, which provide that, in the case of equivalent products, equivalence must be attested by an appropriate certificate from the manufacturer, to be presented to the contracting authority at `the time of the first delivery of an equivalent spare part'. However, a systematic interpretation of Article 34(8) of Directive 2004/17 could require proof of equivalence to be furnished at the time when a tender is submitted.</p>

                <p>19 By its first question, the referring court asks whether Article 34(8) of Directive 2004/17 must be interpreted as meaning that, when the technical specifications in the contract documentation refer to a specific mark, origin or production, the contracting authority must require the tenderer to submit, as part of its tender, proof that the products which it proposes are equivalent to those defined in the technical specifications.</p>

            <p>According to Article 34(2) of Directive 2004/17, technical specifications must afford equal access for tenderers and must not have the effect of creating unjustified obstacles to the opening-up of public procurement to competition.</p>

            <p>It is in the light of that objective that Article 34(8) of Directive 2004/17 provides that technical specifications may not refer to a specific make or source, or to a particular process, or to trade marks, patents, types or a specific origin or production with the effect of favouring or eliminating certain undertakings or certain products, unless they are justified by the subject matter of the contract. Such a reference is to be permitted on an exceptional basis only, where a sufficiently precise and intelligible description of the subject matter of the contract pursuant to Article 34(3) and (4) is not possible, and it must be accompanied by the words `or equivalent'.</p>

            <p>In that regard, Article 34(3) to (5) of Directive 2004/17 expressly states that, where the technical specifications are determined by reference to certain standards or in terms of performance or functional requirements, or to a combination of those standards or requirements, the tenderer must prove in its tender that it satisfies the requirements in the contract documentation. It also follows from that article that proof can be provided by `any appropriate means' and that, in that regard, `an appropriate means might be constituted by a technical dossier from the manufacturer or a test report from a recognised body'.</p>

            <p>It thus follows from paragraphs 3 to 5 of Article 34 of Directive 2004/17 that those paragraphs define general rules concerning the formulation of the technical specifications, the means by which the tenderer can prove that its tender satisfies the requirements in those specifications and the stage at which that proof must be provided.</p>

            <p>In relation to those general rules, Article 34(8) lays down specific rules governing the conditions under which a particular way of defining the content of the technical specifications, inter alia the reference to a specific make or source, or to a particular process, or to trade marks, patents, types or a specific origin or production, is permitted.</p>

            <p>The exception which it establishes, which, by its very nature, must be interpreted narrowly, does not cover the point in time at which the tenderer must prove that its tender satisfies the requirements in the technical specifications or the means of proof available to it. Those criteria therefore remain subject to the general rules set out in Article 34(3) to (5) of Directive 2004/17.</p>

            <p>It follows that, when the contracting authority makes use of the option available to it under the second sentence of Article 34(8) of that directive, it must require the tenderer which wishes to avail itself of the possibility of tendering products equivalent to those defined by reference to a specific mark, origin or production to provide, at the time of submission of its tender, proof of the equivalence of the products concerned.</p>

            <p>First of all, the principle of equal treatment and the duty of transparency enshrined in Article 10 of that directive require, in particular, that tenderers must be in a position of equality both when they formulate their tenders and when those tenders are being assessed by the contracting authority, and constitute the basis of the EU rules on procedures for the award of public contracts (judgment of 24 May 2016, MT Højgaard and Züblin, C‑396/14, EU:C:2016:347, paragraph 37).</p>

            <p>Such verification and the possible adoption of a decision that equivalence does not exist can, however, take place only after the tenders have been opened, when they are assessed by the contracting entity, which means that that entity must have evidence that enables it to assess whether and to what extent the tenders submitted satisfy the requirements in the technical specifications, as otherwise it will run the risk that the principle of equal treatment may be infringed and that the tendering procedure may be vitiated by an irregularity.</p>

            <p>With regard to the means by which tenderers can prove the equivalence of the solutions which they propose, the provisions of Article 34(4) and (5) of Directive 2004/17 are also applicable in procedures where the specific method of formulating the technical specifications, provided for in Article 34(8), has been adopted, which means that the use of any appropriate means is permitted.</p>

            <p>As a result, although the contracting entity cannot permit tenderers to prove the equivalence of the solutions which they propose after they have submitted their tenders, that entity has a discretion in determining the means that may be used by tenderers to prove such equivalence in their tenders. That discretion must, however, be exercised in such a way that the means of proof allowed by the contracting entity actually enable that entity to carry out a meaningful assessment of the tenders submitted to it and do not go beyond what is necessary in order to do so, by preventing those means of proof from creating unjustified obstacles to the opening-up of public procurement to competition, in breach of Article 34(2) of Directive 2004/17.</p>

Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby rules: Article 34(8) of Directive 2004/17/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors must be interpreted as meaning that, when the technical specifications in the contract documentation refer to a specific mark, origin or production, the contracting authority must require the tenderer to submit, already in its tender, proof that the products which it proposes are equivalent to those defined in the technical specifications.</p>
