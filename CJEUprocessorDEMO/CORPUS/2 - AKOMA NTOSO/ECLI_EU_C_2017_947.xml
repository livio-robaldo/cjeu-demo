            <p>and Philips France brought an action before the Conseil d'État (Council of State, France) for the annulment of Article 1(3) and Article 2 of Decree No 2014-1359. They claim that, to the extent that at least some drug prescription assistance software falls within the scope of Directive 93/42, the provisions of Article L. 161-38 of the Social Security Code and of that decree, in that they make certain software items subject to a certification requirement even though they bear the CE marking, do not comply with the objectives of Article 4 of that directive, which prohibits Member States from preventing or restricting the placing on the market or the putting into service of devices bearing the CE marking.</p>

            <p>The applicants in the main proceedings also allege an infringement of Article 8 of Directive 93/42 in that the certification requirement provided for under national law cannot be regarded as a safeguard clause within the meaning of that article. They further allege a breach of Article 34 TFEU in so far as the requirement to adapt software to technical standards constitutes a measure having equivalent effect to quantitative restrictions on imports which, overlapping with the certification obligation for medical devices laid down in Directive 93/42, which is applicable to software, does not meet the requirements of necessity and proportionality.</p>

            <p>In the light of the foregoing, the Conseil d'État (Council of State) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling: `Must Directive [93/42] be interpreted as meaning that software, the purpose of which is to offer to prescribers practising in towns, a health establishment or a medico-social establishment support for determining a drug prescription, in order to improve the safety of prescription, facilitate the work of the prescriber, encourage conformity of the prescription with national regulatory requirements and reduce the cost of treatment at the same quality, constitutes a medical device within the meaning of that directive, where that software has at least one function that permits the use of data specific to a patient to help his doctor issue his prescription, in particular by detecting contraindications, drug interactions and excessive doses, even though it does not itself act in or on the human body?'</p>

            <p>By its question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 1(1) and Article 1(2)(a) of Directive 93/42 must be interpreted as meaning that software, of which at least one of the functions makes it possible to use patient-specific data for the purposes, inter alia, of detecting contraindications, drug interactions and excessive doses, is, in respect of that function, a medical device within the meaning of those provisions, even if that software does not act directly in or on the human body.</p>

            <p>It is expressly apparent from Article 1(2)(a) of Directive 93/42 that software constitutes a medical device for the purposes of that directive where it satisfies the two cumulative conditions which must be met by any device of that nature, relating respectively to the objective pursued and the action resulting therefrom.</p>

            <p>As regards, first, the objective pursued, Article 1(2)(a) of that directive provides that a medical device must be intended by the manufacturer for use in humans for the purposes, in particular, of the diagnosis, prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of a disease, and the diagnosis, monitoring, treatment, alleviation of or compensation for an injury or handicap.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be stated that the wording of Article 1(2)(a) of Directive 93/42 was amended by Article 2 of Directive 2007/47, recital 6 of which states that software is a medical device in its own right when specifically intended by the manufacturer to be used for one or more of the medical purposes set out in the definition of a medical device. That recital further states that software for general purposes, when used in a healthcare setting, is not a medical device. The EU legislature thus made unequivocally clear that, in order for software to fall within the scope of Directive 93/42, it is not sufficient that it be used in a medical context; it is also necessary that the intended purpose, defined by the manufacturer, is specifically medical (judgment of 22 November 2012, Brain Products, C‑219/11, EU:C:2012:742, paragraphs 16 and 17). Software which does not meet that condition may fall within the scope of that directive only if it is an accessory to a medical device within the meaning of Article 1(2)(b) thereof. That software should then be treated, for the purposes of that directive, in accordance with Article 1(1) thereof, as a medical device in its own right.</p>

            <p>In the present case, software that cross-references patient-specific data with the drugs that the doctor is contemplating prescribing, and is thus able to provide the doctor, in an automated manner, with an analysis intended to detect, in particular, possible contraindications, drug interactions and excessive dosages, is used for the purpose of prevention, monitoring, treatment or alleviation of a disease, and therefore pursues a specifically medical objective, making it a medical device within the meaning of Article 1(2)(a) of Directive 93/42.</p>

            <p>In that respect, it should be noted that although that provision provides that the main action of the medical device `in or on the human body' cannot be obtained exclusively by pharmacological or immunological means, or by metabolism, it does not require such a device to act directly in or on the human body.</p>

            <p>As is apparent from recital 6 of Directive 2007/47 and paragraph 24 of the present judgment, the EU legislature intended to focus, in order to classify software as a medical device, on the purpose of its use and not the manner in which the effect it is capable of producing on or in the human body is likely to materialise.</p>

            <p>Moreover, refusing to classify a device which does not act directly in or on the human body as a `medical device' would in practice exclude from the scope of Directive 93/42 software which is specifically intended by the manufacturer to be used for one or more of the medical purposes set out in the definition of a medical device, even though the EU legislature intended, by Directive 2007/47, to include such software in that definition, whether or not the software works directly in or on the human body.</p>

            <p>Thus, it does not matter whether, in order to be classified as a medical device, software acts directly or indirectly on the human body, the essential point being that its purpose is specifically one of those referred to in paragraph 24 of the present judgment.</p>

            <p>That interpretation is confirmed by the Commission Guidelines on the qualification and classification of stand-alone software used in healthcare within the regulatory framework of medical devices, Meddev 2.1/6, whose objective is to promote a uniform application of the provisions of Directive 93/42 within the European Union. Both in the version published in January 2012 and in the one published in July 2016, those guidelines indicate that software constitutes a medical device where it is specifically intended by the manufacturer to be used for one of the purposes set out in Article 1(2)(a) of Directive 93/42 and where it is intended to create or modify medical information, in particular by means of calculation, quantification or comparison of the recorded data against certain references, in order to provide information about a particular patient. Those guidelines further state that software that does not perform an action on data or performs an action limited to storage, archiving, lossless compression or, finally, simple search, that is to say, in the latter case, software that functions as a digital library and makes it possible to find information from metadata, without modifying or interpreting it, should not be considered a medical device.</p>

Once the marking has been obtained, the product, having regard to that function, may be placed on the market and circulate freely in the European Union without having to undergo any additional procedure, such as a new certification (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 November 2009, Nordiska Dental, C‑288/08, EU:C:2009:718, paragraph 21).</p>
