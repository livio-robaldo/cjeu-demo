            <p>In the course of the main proceedings, the Marszałek Sejmu Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej (Speaker of the Lower House of the Parliament of the Republic of Poland) and the Prokurator Generalny (General Public Prosecutor, Poland) stated that, since the provisions of Polish law at issue were adopted in order to transpose Article 98(2) of Directive 2006/112 as amended and point 6 of Annex III thereto into domestic law, the Polish legislature could not depart from those provisions without infringing its obligations under EU law. The same view was taken by the members of the Polish Government invited by the national court to express their opinion in the case.</p>

            <p>First, that court observes that Directive 2009/47, from which point 6 of Annex III to Directive 2006/112 as amended stems, could be vitiated by a procedural defect, since that point differs in its wording from the text of the proposal for a directive which had been submitted to the Parliament.</p>

            <p>Secondly, it considers that Article 98(2) of Directive 2006/112 as amended, read in conjunction with point 6 of Annex III thereto, could be contrary to the principle of fiscal neutrality. Whilst digital books made available on a physical support and those transmitted electronically have similar properties and meet the same consumer needs, Article 98(2) permits a reduced rate of VAT to be applied only to the supply of digital books on a physical support.</p>

                <p>Is Article 98(2) of Directive 2006/112/EC as amended, in conjunction with point 6 of Annex III to that directive, invalid on the ground that it infringes the principle of fiscal neutrality to the extent to which it excludes the application of reduced tax rates to electronic books and other electronic publications?'</p>

                </tblock>
                <p>22 By its first question, the national court asks, in essence, whether point 6 of Annex III to Directive 2006/112 as amended is invalid on the ground that the legislative procedure that led to its adoption was vitiated by infringement of an essential procedural requirement. Since the wording of point 6 of Annex III to Directive 2006/112 as amended differs from the text which was set out in the proposal for a directive on the basis of which the Parliament was consulted, the national court wonders whether the Parliament should have been consulted afresh.</p>

Consequently, the factors which characterise those two situations, and the question whether the situations are comparable, must be determined and assessed in the light of the objectives pursued by the legislature when it permitted the Member States to apply a reduced rate of VAT to the supply of digital books on all physical means of support.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be pointed out that the power of the Member States to apply a reduced rate of VAT to the supply of printed books was laid down for the first time by Council Directive 92/77/EEC of 19 October 1992 supplementing the common system of value added tax and amending Directive 77/388/EEC (approximation of VAT rates) ( OJ 1992 L 316, p. 1). Article 1 of that directive inserted into the Sixth Directive Annex H relating to the list of supplies of goods and services which may be subject to reduced rates of VAT, point 6 of which was reproduced in point 6 of Annex III to Directive 2006/112, in the version before Directive 2009/47 entered into force. That power was extended by Directive 2009/47 to the supply of books on `all physical means of support'.</p>

            <p>As the Advocate General has observed in point 56 of her Opinion, the objective underlying the application of a reduced rate of VAT to the supply of books consists in the promotion of reading, whether of literature, non-fiction, newspapers or periodicals.</p>

As the rules on VAT are intended, in principle, to tax the consumption of goods and the consumption of services in the same way, that different classification does not appear decisive in the light of the objective, noted in paragraph 45 of this judgment, that is pursued by Article 98(2) of that directive, read in conjunction with point 6 of Annex III thereto.</p>

Indeed, according to the preparatory documents, e-commerce offers considerable potential for creating wealth and employment in the European Union, and the provision of a clear and definite regulatory environment is an essential prerequisite for creating the climate of confidence in which business will invest and trade.</p>

            <p>By precluding the application of a reduced rate of VAT to electronically supplied services, the EU legislature spares taxable persons and national tax authorities from an obligation to examine, for each type of electronic service that is supplied, whether it falls within one of the categories of services that qualify for such a rate under Annex III to Directive 2006/112 as amended.</p>

            <p>Thus, the measure at issue must be regarded as being appropriate for achieving the objective of establishing with certainty the VAT rate applicable to electronically supplied services and thus of facilitating the administration of VAT by taxable persons and national tax authorities.</p>

            <p>So far as concerns the requirement, associated with the proportionality condition, that the measure chosen must be the least restrictive among the appropriate measures that may be envisaged and that the disadvantages caused must not be disproportionate to the objectives pursued, it should be noted that the EU legislature might possibly have separated the supply of digital books electronically from electronic services as a whole and, accordingly, have permitted the application of a reduced rate of VAT to those books.</p>

            <p>However, such a solution would be liable to run counter to the objective pursued by the EU legislature relating to the need to remedy the lack of legal certainty resulting from the constant developments to which all electronic services are subject, for which reason the EU legislature excluded all of those services from the list of transactions qualifying for a reduced rate of VAT under Annex III to Directive 2006/112 as amended.</p>

            <p>To accept that the Member States are able to apply a reduced rate of VAT to the supply of digital books electronically, as is permitted for the supply of such books on all physical means of support, would effectively compromise the overall coherence of the measure intended by the EU legislature, consisting in the exclusion of all electronic services from the possibility of a reduced rate of VAT being applied.</p>

            <p>As to the option of extending the possibility of applying a reduced rate of VAT to all electronic services, it should be pointed out that the adoption of such a measure would have introduced, generally, unequal treatment between non-electronic services, to which a reduced rate of VAT does not, as a rule, apply, and electronic services.</p>

            <p>It should be added that it is apparent from Articles 4 and 5 of Directive 2002/38 and Article 6 of Council Directive 2008/8/EC of 12 February 2008 amending Directive 2006/112 as regards the place of supply of services ( OJ 2008 L 44, p. 11) that the Council envisaged re-examining the specific taxation system for electronically supplied services, in the light of experience acquired. Moreover, in a communication to the European Parliament, the Council and the European Economic and Social Committee on an action plan on VAT (COM(2016) 148 final), the Commission announced its intention to consider the drawing up of a proposal for a directive amending Directive 2006/112 as amended.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, the difference in treatment -- resulting from Article 98(2) of Directive 2006/112 as amended, read in conjunction with point 6 of Annex III thereto -- between the supply of digital books electronically and the supply of books on all physical means of support must be regarded as duly justified.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules: Examination of the questions referred for a preliminary ruling has disclosed no factor of such a kind as to affect the validity of point 6 of Annex III to Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax, as amended by Council Directive 2009/47/EC of 5 May 2009, or of Article 98(2) of that directive, read in conjunction with point 6 of Annex III thereto.</p>
