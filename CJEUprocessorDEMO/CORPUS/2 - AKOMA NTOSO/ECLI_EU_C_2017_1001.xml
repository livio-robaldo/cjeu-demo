            <p>By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 19 February 2015, Binca brought an action seeking annulment of the regulation at issue. It maintained that it was the subject of discrimination, since, in the regulation at issue, the Commission had laid down transitional measures and derogating rules specific to organic aquacultures other than its own. That regulation, it argued, thus operated to the advantage of its competitors but did not lay down any transitional and derogating measure from which it could itself benefit. According to Binca, such transitional and derogating measures concerned in particular the origin of juvenile animals.</p>

Given that the regulation at issue did not amend that transitional period, the General Court took the view, in the order under appeal, that annulment of the implementing regulation would not alter the applicable legal framework. Without examining the other conditions governing admissibility of the action, the General Court accordingly held, in paragraph 73 of the order under appeal, that Binca did not have an interest in bringing proceedings for annulment of the regulation at issue and that, consequently, its action was inadmissible.</p>

Such an interest requires that the annulment of that act must be capable, in itself, of having legal consequences and that the action may therefore, through its outcome, procure an advantage to the party which brought it (judgments of 4 June 2015, Andechser Molkerei Scheitz v Commission, C‑682/13 P, not published, EU:C:2015:356, paragraph 25; of 17 September 2015, Mory and Others v Commission, C‑33/14 P, EU:C:2015:609, paragraph 55, as well as order of 6 April 2017, Proforec v Commission, C‑176/16 P, not published, EU:C:2017:290, paragraph 32).</p>

In particular, in order for an action seeking annulment of an act, submitted by a natural or legal person, to be admissible, the applicant must justify in a relevant manner its interest in the annulment of that act (judgment of 4 June 2015, Andechser Molkerei Scheitz v Commission, C-682/13 P, not published, EU:C:2015:356, paragraphs 26 to 28, and order of 6 April 2017, Proforec v Commission, C‑176/16 P, not published, EU:C:2017:290, paragraphs 33 and 34).</p>

            <p>In the present case, it follows from paragraphs 60 and 62 of the order under appeal that Binca argued, before the General Court, that the regulation at issue enabled certain of its competitors, but not Binca itself, to continue marketing their products with the `bio' label and that, inasmuch as it could no longer sell pangasius with that label, consumers would transfer their choice to fish from other organic aquaculture species. Binca therefore maintained that, if the regulation at issue were annulled, it would be able to keep its customers since its competitors would no longer be authorised to use the `bio' label either.</p>

In that application, Binca stated, in relation to the origin of juvenile animals, that the amendment of Article 25e(4) of the implementing regulation by Article 1(1) of the regulation at issue led to unequal treatment between aquaculture carried out in the Mekong Delta and that carried out in brackish water zones in Europe.</p>

It is indeed clear from the provisions of Article 21 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and Article 44(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court of 2 May 1991 (now Article 76 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court of 23 April 2015) that the application submitted at first instance must contain, inter alia, the subject matter of the dispute and a brief statement of the pleas in law relied on.</p>

            <p>As regards, by contrast, the question as to whether Binca had an interest in bringing proceedings for the annulment of Article 1(1) of the regulation at issue, amending Article 25e(4) of the implementing regulation, the Commission notes, first, that that company, being merely a fish importer, is not in competition with the producers allegedly favoured by the regulation at issue and, second, that pangasius is not in competition with the other types of fish which, according to Binca, are given preferential treatment by the regulation at issue.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, in the first place, as follows from paragraphs 25 and 26 of the present judgment, Binca's role in the supply chain of organic pangasius from Vietnam is wider and more complex than that of a traditional importer. In any event, given that the requirements relating to organic labelling to which importers of organic aquaculture products are subject include the production requirements imposed by the regulation at issue, a fact which the Commission acknowledged during the hearing before the Court, it cannot be held, in the present case, that fish producers alone are liable to have an interest in the annulment of the regulation at issue.</p>

            <p>In the second place, it is not for the Court, at the stage of the examination of admissibility, to make a definitive finding on the competitive relationship between Binca and the fish producers allegedly favoured by the regulation at issue or between organic pangasius and the other fish from organic aquaculture for the purpose of determining whether Binca has an interest in bringing proceedings (see, by analogy, judgment of 28 January 1986, Cofaz and Others v Commission, 169/84, EU:C:1986:42, paragraph 28). In the present case, it is sufficient to establish that Binca has justified in a relevant way the interest which it has in the annulment of the regulation at issue.</p>

            <p>In that regard, Binca not only claimed before the General Court that it would benefit from the annulment of Article 1(1) of the regulation at issue, amending Article 25e(4) of the implementing regulation, but also explained how that amendment made by the regulation at issue creates advantages for certain of the other organic aquaculture fish producers and results in negative commercial consequences for Binca itself.</p>

            <p>In the context of that argument, Binca also stated that, because of the specific natural conditions governing aquaculture farming in the Mekong Delta, the holding which supplies Binca could not, in contrast to holdings located in European waters, benefit from Article 25e(4)(c) of the implementing regulation, in its version resulting from Article 1(1) of the regulation at issue.</p>

            <p>It must be noted in this regard, as is clear from point 87 of the Opinion of the Advocate General, that, according to recitals 3 and 4 of the regulation at issue, the exceptions set out in Article 25e(4) of the implementing regulation are intended to facilitate the ongoing production of organic fish that would otherwise be interrupted. The annulment requested by Binca would thus eliminate those exceptions and make it harder, or even impossible, to produce certain types of fish organically, within the meaning of the basic regulation, the implementing regulation and the regulations amending the implementing regulation.</p>

            <p>The view must therefore be taken that Binca has justified to the requisite legal standard its interest in bringing proceedings by putting forward in a relevant manner, before the General Court, the negative effects, for it, of the provisions of the regulation at issue covered by its action for annulment, as well as the benefit which it is likely to derive from the annulment of those provisions. At the stage of the examination of the admissibility of the action brought before the General Court, that benefit must be acknowledged regardless of whether or not the General Court, at the conclusion of the proceedings before it, annuls the provision under challenge.</p>
