            <p>The referring court points out, in the first place, that the Law on Fisheries implements, in particular, Regulation No 1380/2013 and concludes that, on the basis of that law, operators are not treated on an equal footing as regards the allocation of fishing opportunities. In such circumstances and in the absence of objective justification, the different treatment of certain operators constitutes an infringement of the Lithuanian constitutional principles of free competition and equal treatment.</p>

            <p>In the second place, that court asks whether the discretion conferred on the Member States by Article 16(6) of Regulation 1380/2013 allows the Member States to lay down criteria for the allocation of fishing opportunities resulting in the creation of unequal conditions for operators who are competing with each other to secure such opportunities.</p>

            <p>The referring court takes the view that that discretion is not unlimited, in that Article 17 of that regulation provides that the Member States must adopt transparent and objective criteria, including criteria of an environmental, social and economic nature. More specifically, it is uncertain, first, whether national legislation, such as the Law on Fisheries, which lays down a method of allocation of individual fishing opportunities which is based principally on historical data relating to quantities caught and which may, on that ground, create those conditions of inequality, may be considered `objective'. Second, the referring court is uncertain whether the restrictions on competition deriving from the adoption of that method are incompatible with EU law, even if that method meets the conditions of objectivity and transparency set out in Article 17 of Regulation No 1380/2013.</p>

            <p>In the third place, the referring court points out that when a Member State implements an EU regulation it must comply with the Charter. Thus, it asks whether Articles 16 and 20 of the Charter, concerning freedom to conduct a business and equality before the law, preclude a Member State from adopting a method of allocation of fishing quotas which creates unequal conditions for fishing operators seeking to secure fishing opportunities, even if that method is based on the criteria set out in Article 17 of Regulation No 1380/2013.</p>

            <p>In the fourth and final place, in the light of the competing objectives of the common fisheries policy, the referring court seeks to ascertain whether Article 2(5)(c) of Regulation No 1380/2013 must be interpreted as precluding Member States from choosing a method of allocation of fishing quotas which causes unequal conditions for operators who are competing for a greater quantity of fishing opportunities, even if that method is based on a transparent and objective criterion.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the Lietuvos vyriausiasis administracinis teismas (Supreme Administrative Court of Lithuania) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling: `Are Articles 17 and 2(5)(c) of Regulation (EU) [No 1380/2013], read in the light of Articles 16 and 20 of the [Charter], to be interpreted as meaning that, when a Member State exercises the discretion provided for in Article 16(6) [of that regulation], it is prohibited from choosing a method of allocation of the fishing quotas allocated to it which causes unequal conditions for [operators] who are competing for a greater quantity of fishing opportunities, even if that method is based on a transparent and objective criterion?'</p>

            <p>Banginis argues that the Court does not have jurisdiction to rule on the question referred to it. According to that company, EU law is not applicable to the dispute in the main proceedings, in that the Republic of Lithuania, when it adopts a method of allocation of individual fishing opportunities does not implement EU law, but acts on the basis of its exclusive competence.</p>

            <p>According to Article 16(6) of that regulation, each Member State decides how the fishing opportunities that are allocated to it may be allocated to vessels flying its flag. It follows, in that regard, from the case-law of the Court concerning Article 20(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 2371/2002 of 20 December 2002 on the conservation and sustainable exploitation of fisheries resources under the Common Fisheries Policy ( OJ 2002 L 358, p. 59), which corresponds to Article 16(6) of Regulation No 1380/2013, that the Member States enjoy a measure of discretion in implementing that regulation (see, to that effect, order of 5 May 2009, Atlantic Dawn and Others v Commission, C‑372/08 P, not published, EU:C:2009:287, paragraph 41).</p>

Thus, such a method of allocation may, first, be detrimental to the freedom to conduct a business of new operators, by limiting their right to operate on the market at issue, and, second, result in unjustified unequal treatment between the different types of operators.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, that law establishes, first, a system of auction allowing new operators to acquire non-allocated fishing opportunities, on the basis of the balance of the quota granted to the Republic of Lithuania after allocations on the basis of historical share have been made. In addition, that law limits the fishing opportunities which can be allocated to each operator for a given species of fish to 40%. Thus, the allocation method at issue in the main proceedings, since it does not entail the complete closure of the market in question, respects the essence of the freedom guaranteed by Article 16 of the Charter.</p>
