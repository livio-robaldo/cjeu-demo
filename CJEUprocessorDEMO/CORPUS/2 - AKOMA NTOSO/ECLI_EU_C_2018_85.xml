Even if that video were to be regarded as a `programme' within the meaning of Article 1(1)(b), the principal purpose of that channel is, however, not the provision of programmes in order to inform, entertain or educate the general public, as required under Article 1(1)(a)(i).</p>

            <p>Those specific features of programmes, for the broadcasting of which Directive 2010/13 provides a regulatory framework, are set out in greater detail in recital 22 of that directive, which states that the definition of an audiovisual media service should cover mass media in their function to inform, entertain and educate the general public.</p>

            <p>However, a promotional video channel on the YouTube internet service, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, cannot be regarded as having as its principal purpose the provision of programmes in order to inform, entertain or educate the general public.</p>

            <p>Without it being necessary to determine whether a promotional video constitutes a programme as referred to in Article 1(1)(a)(i) of Directive 2010/13 and defined in Article 1(1)(b), it is clear that the purpose of such a video is to promote, for purely commercial purposes, the product or service advertised.</p>

            <p>In that regard, to the extent that a promotional video can inform, entertain or educate viewers, as Peugeot Deutschland claims, it does so with the sole aim of, and as a means of, achieving the promotional purpose of the video in question.</p>

            <p>Therefore, even in the event that a promotional video channel on YouTube were to satisfy the other criteria and display the features of an audiovisual media service referred to in Article 1(1)(a)(i) of Directive 2010/13, its promotional purpose suffices to exclude it from the scope of that provision.</p>

            <p>That finding is not called into question by Peugeot Deutschland's assertion that such an exclusion amounts to a difference in treatment of its promotional videos as against programmes which do not have any advertising purpose, which, it submits, is contrary to Article 11 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union enshrining the freedom of expression and information.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it suffices to note that the argument that the principle of equal treatment requires the inclusion of a promotional video channel, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, within the scope of Article 1(1)(a)(i) of Directive 2010/13 is based on the false premiss that those videos are, in the light of the objective which they pursue, in a comparable situation to that of non-promotional programmes.</p>

            <p>In the second place, the audiovisual media service referred to in Article 1(1)(a)(ii) of Directive 2010/13 consists of `audiovisual commercial communication'. `Audiovisual commercial communication' is defined, in turn, in paragraph 1(h) of that article as `images with or without sound which are designed to promote, directly or indirectly, the goods, services or image of a natural or legal entity pursuing an economic activity. Such images accompany or are included in a programme in return for payment or for similar consideration or for self-promotional purposes. Forms of audiovisual commercial communication include, inter alia, television advertising, sponsorship, teleshopping and product placement'.</p>

            <p>However, a video such as that at issue in the main proceedings cannot be regarded as accompanying or being included in a programme in return for payment or for similar consideration or for self-promotional purposes. Inasmuch as a video channel, such as that run by Peugeot Deutschland, contains solely videos, such as the video at issue in the main proceedings, which are individual elements independent of one another, it cannot reasonably be argued that that video accompanies or is included in a `programme', within the meaning of Article 1(1)(h) of Directive 2010/13.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, Peugeot Deutschland's argument that the images pursuing advertising purposes are situated at the beginning and at the end of the video at issue in the main proceedings and, therefore, accompany or are included in that video, which itself constitutes a programme, cannot be accepted.</p>

            <p>The view cannot be taken that the EU legislature, in using the words `accompany' and `be included', regard being had to their ordinary meaning, was referring to individual images that are part of or even central to a programme. A video such as that in the present case is promotional in its entirety and it would be artificial to assert that only the images at the beginning and the end of that video pursue advertising purposes.</p>

            <p>It follows that, by virtue of the information that an audiovisual commercial communication, as defined in Article 1(1)(h) of Directive 2010/13, consists of images accompanying or included in a programme, a promotional video, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, is excluded from the scope of Article 1(1)(a)(ii) of that directive.</p>

            <p>In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the question referred is that Article 1(1)(a) of Directive 2010/13 must be interpreted as meaning that the definition of `audiovisual media service' covers neither a video channel, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, on which internet users can view short promotional videos for new passenger car models, nor a single video of that kind considered in isolation.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Ninth Chamber) hereby rules: Article 1(1)(a) of Directive 2010/13/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 10 March 2010 on the coordination of certain provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in Member States concerning the provision of audiovisual media services (the Audiovisual Media Services Directive) must be interpreted as meaning that the definition of `audiovisual media service' covers neither a video channel, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, on which internet users can view short promotional videos for new passenger car models, nor a single video of that kind considered in isolation.</p>
