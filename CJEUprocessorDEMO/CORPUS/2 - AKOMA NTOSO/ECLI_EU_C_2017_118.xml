            <p>In its ruling of 16 December 2014, the Vilniaus apygardos teismas (Regional Court, Vilnius), hearing an appeal by W against the judgment of the Vilniaus miesto apylinkės teismas (District Court, Vilnius) of 25 September 2014, overturned that judgment in part and referred the case back to the lower court for reconsideration.</p>

            <p>By decision of 23 December 2014, that court declared that it lacked jurisdiction to hear and determine W's applications on the grounds that the rules on jurisdiction in Regulation No 2201/2003 had to prevail over the provisions in the Lithuanian Code of Civil Procedure. According to that court, except in certain cases of a change in the child's residence or as a result of an agreement between the holders of parental responsibility, it is for the courts of the Member State where the child is habitually resident, that is to say, in the present case, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, to hear and determine those applications. The court informed the applicant that he could bring the matter before a court with jurisdiction in the Netherlands.</p>

            <p>On 31 March 2015, the Vilniaus apygardos teismas (Regional Court, Vilnius) hearing W's appeal against the judgment of the Vilniaus miesto apylinkės teismas (District Court, Vilnius) of 23 December 2014, set aside that judgment and referred the case back to the latter court so that that court could reconsider the admissibility of W's applications. It held that that court had wrongly held that it had no jurisdiction to hear those applications, when they sought the amendment of the decision of the Vilniaus miesto apylinkės teismas (District Court, Vilnius) of 8 October 2013, which has become final, concerning, inter alia, child V's residence, the contact arrangements and the maintenance obligations. Such an amendment may be brought about only by way of a new judicial decision that has become final. However, in the present case, in so far as the Netherlands courts refuse to recognise the judgment of 8 October 2013, it is impossible for W to bring his application for amendment of the rights and obligations in that judgment before those courts.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, it is necessary, first, to reject the arguments of W and the European Commission seeking to call into question the Court's jurisdiction. W and the Commission argue in their written observations that the referring court requests the Court to designate the Member State whose courts have jurisdiction to rule on the dispute in the main proceedings. However, the referring court is responsible for that task inasmuch as the Court has jurisdiction only to interpret the provisions of EU law and not to rule on the substance of the questions before the national courts.</p>

It is for the referring court to give a ruling in the dispute before it, taking into account the Court's reply (judgment of 4 February 2010, Genc, C‑14/09, EU:C:2010:57, paragraph 31).</p>

That concept corresponds to the place that reflects some degree of integration of the child in a social and family environment. That place must be established by the national court, taking account of the circumstances of fact specific to each individual case. The conditions and reasons for the child's stay on the territory of a Member State and the child's nationality are of particular relevance. In addition to the physical presence of the child in a Member State, which must be taken into consideration, other factors must also make it clear that that presence is not in any way temporary or intermittent (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 December 2010, Mercredi, C‑497/10 PPU, EU:C:2010:829, paragraphs 47 to 49).</p>

            <p>However, no such facts are apparent from the documents in the case file before the Court. In particular, it does not appear either that Child V had moved from Lithuania to the Netherlands before the Vilniaus miesto apylinkės teismas (District Court, Vilnius) was seised or that there was an agreement between the holders of parental responsibility as to the jurisdiction of the Lithuanian courts. Moreover, the referring court makes no mention of an abduction or wrongful retention of child V, nor does it appear that the Lithuanian courts were designated by the Netherlands courts as being best placed to hear the case in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>Thus, in a case such as that in the main proceedings, it is the courts of the Member State of the child's habitual residence that have jurisdiction in matters of parental responsibility. In the present case, the courts thus designated by the referring court are the Netherlands courts.</p>

            <p>It is, consequently, for those courts to decide on applications, such as those of W, seeking to change the child's place of residence, vary the amount of maintenance and change the contact arrangements for the parent concerned.</p>

            <p>It should be pointed out, as the Advocate General noted in points 43 to 49 of his Opinion, that the courts which made a decision in the divorce proceedings, in the present case the Lithuanian courts, do not in a case such as that in the main proceedings enjoy any prorogation of jurisdiction. Even if the jurisdiction of those courts has been accepted expressly or otherwise in an unequivocal manner by X, in accordance with Article 12(1)(b) of Regulation No 2201/2003, that jurisdiction has in any event come to an end, since the decision granting the application for divorce and deciding on parental responsibility has become final, in accordance with Article 12(2)(a) and (b) of that regulation.</p>

            <p>The fact that the final decision on which the parent concerned relies in order to make his application for variation has not been recognised, in whole or in part, by the courts of the Member State of the child's habitual residence does not prevent, whether or not that lack of recognition is justified, those courts from having jurisdiction to decide on that application, since that application gives rise to new proceedings.</p>

            <p>It follows from all of the foregoing considerations that the answer to the question referred is that Article 8 of Regulation No 2201/2003 and Article 3 of Regulation No 4/2009 must be interpreted as meaning that, in a case such as that in the main proceedings, the courts of the Member State which made a decision that has become final concerning parental responsibility and maintenance obligations with regard to a minor child no longer have jurisdiction to decide on an application for variation of the provisions ordered in that decision, inasmuch as the habitual residence of the child is in another Member State. It is the courts of the Member State of habitual residence that have jurisdiction to decide on that application.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules: Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000, and Article 3 of Council Regulation (EC) No 4/2009 of 18 December 2008 on jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition and enforcement of decisions and cooperation in matters relating to maintenance obligations, must be interpreted as meaning that, in a case such as that in the main proceedings, the courts of the Member State which made a decision that has become final concerning parental responsibility and maintenance obligations with regard to a minor child no longer have jurisdiction to decide on an application for variation of the provisions ordered in that decision, inasmuch as the habitual residence of the child is in another Member State.
