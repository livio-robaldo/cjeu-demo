            <p>As regards the wording of Article 1(3) of Implementing Regulation No 412/2013, that wording provides for the application of an individual anti-dumping duty rate to be conditional on the presentation, to the customs authorities of the Member States, of a valid commercial invoice conforming to the requirements set out in Annex II to that regulation. If no such invoice is presented, the rate of duty applicable to all other companies, not listed in that regulation, is to apply.</p>

            <p>It follows clearly from that wording, in particular from the word `conditional', that the presentation, to the customs authorities, of a valid commercial invoice conforming to the requirements set out in Annex II to that regulation is an indispensable condition for the application of an individual anti-dumping duty rate.</p>

            <p>By contrast, that wording provides no information whatsoever as to when that invoice must be presented. Therefore, that wording does not preclude an invoice, which meets all the requirements set out in Article 1(3) of Implementing Regulation No 412/2013, from being presented to the customs authorities after the customs declaration has been made.</p>

            <p>As regards the context of which that Article 1(3) forms part, it must be stated at the outset that, as the Advocate General has noted in point 60 of his Opinion, no other provision of Implementing Regulation No 412/2013, unlike other anti-dumping regulations, specifies the point in time at which a valid commercial invoice must be presented to the customs authorities.</p>

            <p>However, since that regulation does not include any provision which, pursuant to Article 1(4) thereof, would render the provisions in force in the field of customs duties inapplicable, the derailed rules on lodging and checking the customs declaration of goods subject to anti-dumping duties are governed by the Customs Code.</p>

            <p>In that respect, it must be held that that code does not expressly state when a commercial invoice must be presented. Moreover, while Article 62(2) of the Customs Code indicates that the declaration must be accompanied by all the documents required for implementation of the provisions governing the customs procedure for which the goods are declared, including, evidently, a commercial invoice, that provision does not specify the consequences linked to a lack of conformity of the documents accompanying that declaration, such as the commercial invoice at issue in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>That said, in that respect, Article 78 of that code establishes a procedure enabling customs authorities, on their own initiative or at the request of the declarant, to amend the customs declaration after release of the goods covered by that declaration, that is to say, after that declaration has been made.</p>

            <p>To that effect, those authorities may, pursuant to Article 78(1) and (2), first, amend the customs declaration, namely re-examine it, and, second, inspect relevant documents and data in order to ensure the accuracy of the particulars contained in the declaration. If that re-examination or those inspections show that the provisions governing the customs procedure in question have been applied on the basis of incorrect or incomplete information, the customs authorities must, in accordance with Article 78(3), take the measures necessary to regularise the situation, taking account of the new information available to them.</p>

            <p>It thus follows from Article 78 of the Customs Code as a whole that it is permissible to present new material which may be taken into consideration by the customs authorities after the customs declaration has been made. The specific logic of that article is to bring the customs procedure into line with the actual situation (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 December 2015, Veloserviss, C‑427/14, EU:C:2015:803, paragraph 26 and the case-law cited).</p>
