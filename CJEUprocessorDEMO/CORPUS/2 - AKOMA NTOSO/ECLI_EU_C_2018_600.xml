            <p>By judgment of 14 December 2015, the Kauno apygardos teismas (Regional Court, Kaunas) upheld those claims. By decision of 31 May 2016, the Lietuvos apeliacinis teismas (Court of Appeal of Lithuania) upheld that judgment. Those courts held that the 2011 and 2012 agreements included a financial collateral arrangement regarding the funds credited to the account opened in Aviabaltika's name with that bank. They considered that, following the commencement of the insolvency proceedings against Ūkio bankas, those funds were included in the assets remaining after the insolvency and that the right of that bank to make use of them was limited by the prohibition on discharging any obligation that had not been discharged at the date on which those proceedings were commenced, pursuant to the relevant national legislation. Aviabaltika brought an appeal on a point of law before the Lietuvos Aukščiausiasis Teismas (Supreme Court of Lithuania).</p>

            <p>The referring court explains that Aviabaltika and Ūkio bankas entered into a security financial collateral arrangement within the meaning of Article 2(1)(c) of Directive 2002/47 and that an enforcement event occurred after the commencement of the insolvency proceedings against the collateral taker, namely, in the present case, Ūkio bankas. It therefore questions, in particular, whether that collateral could be enforced by the taker in order to enable it to recover its claim against the collateral provider, namely Aviabaltika, arising from that company's failure to discharge financial obligations covered by that arrangement.</p>

            <p>Aviabaltika submits that, in order to recover its claim, Ūkio bankas must, pursuant to Directive 2002/47 and in particular Article 4 thereof, use the funds which it transferred to that bank as collateral and not other assets belonging to Aviabaltika. Aviabaltika also considers that, were Ūkio bankas' claims to be upheld, it would be unable to recover those funds in the insolvency proceedings, and would be required, in practice, to pay the amount of the financial collateral to that bank a second time. Ūkio bankas contends, by contrast, that, under the national banking and insolvency rules, those funds are included in the assets remaining after the insolvency and may not be used to settle its own claims. It adds that, pursuant to that directive, as the collateral taker, it has the right and not an obligation to use the funds transferred in that regard and may choose to recover its claim from Aviabaltika's other assets.</p>

            <p>According to the statements provided by the referring court, the transfer of funds to a bank account as financial collateral had the effect of pledging the claim for repayment of those funds as collateral, with the title to those funds being transferred to the bank. In addition, the national banking and insolvency rules, on which the courts of first instance and appeal relied, are applicable to the situation at issue in the main proceedings, in particular the prohibition on discharging any obligation not yet discharged at the date on which insolvency proceedings were commenced, which precludes the realisation of that collateral and its effective use by the taker. The referring court emphasises that, if the provider is required to settle the relevant financial obligations using its other assets as a result of that non-enforcement, it will come into conflict, in practice, with the insolvency rules for recovering that collateral.</p>

In other words, are Member States obliged to establish legal rules which require that a collateral taker (a bank) should be de facto able to obtain satisfaction of its claim, which is secured by financial collateral (money in an account of the bank and a right of claim to that money), despite the fact that the enforcement event occurred after the commencement of the proceedings for the winding-up of the collateral taker (the bank)?</p>

                <p>If the answer to the second question is in the negative, and the collateral provider satisfies the claim of the collateral taker, which is secured by the financial collateral, by using other assets of the collateral provider, should the provisions of Directive 2002/47, in particular Articles 4 and 8 thereof, be interpreted as meaning that the collateral provider should also have applied to it an exemption from equal treatment of the collateral taker's (the bank's) creditors in winding-up proceedings and that the collateral provider should, in order to recover the financial collateral, be granted priority over other creditors in winding-up proceedings?'</p>

                </tblock>
                <p>21 By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 4(5) of Directive 2002/47 is to be interpreted as requiring Member States to adopt rules which enable a taker of collateral provided under a security financial collateral arrangement to recover its claim, arising from a failure to discharge the relevant financial obligations, from that collateral, where the enforcement event occurs after insolvency proceedings have been commenced against that taker.</p>

            <p>As is apparent from the request for a preliminary ruling, the referring court considers that the financial collateral at issue in the main proceedings is included in the assets remaining after the insolvency of Ūkio bankas (the taker), and cannot, owing to a prohibition on enforcement applicable under national law, be enforced in order effectively to ensure the recovery of its claim. It thus appears that such a situation would have the result of obliging the provider, in practice, to pay the taker the amount of that collateral, which would fall within the scope of the insolvency proceedings, a second time.</p>

            <p>First of all, it is clear from the wording of Article 4(5) of Directive 2002/47 that the Member States are to ensure that a financial collateral arrangement can take effect in accordance with its terms notwithstanding the commencement or continuation of winding-up proceedings in respect of the collateral provider or collateral taker. That provision expressly refers to both parties to the arrangement, without making a distinction, so far as the enforcement of that arrangement is concerned, between whether such proceedings have been brought against one party or against the other.</p>

            <p>Next, regarding the general scheme and objectives of Directive 2002/47, it should be borne in mind that, according to recital 3 thereof, that directive is intended to contribute to the integration and cost-efficiency of the financial market and to the stability of the financial system in the European Union. To that end, Directive 2002/47 establishes a regime, the objective of which is to limit the administrative burdens for parties using financial collateral under the scope of the directive, to improve the legal certainty of such collateral by ensuring that certain provisions of national insolvency law do not apply to financial collateral arrangements in order to safeguard financial stability and limit contagion effects in case of a default of a party to a financial collateral arrangement (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 November 2016, Private Equity Insurance Group, C‑156/15, EU:C:2016:851, paragraph 23).</p>

          <content eId="para_18078__content">
            <p>In that context, having regard to Article 4(1) of that directive, which provides that the taker of collateral under a security financial collateral arrangement must be able to realise the collateral in any of the manners described in the directive, the Court has held that that regime therefore confers an advantage on that financial collateral by comparison with other types of security which fall outside the scope of the directive (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 November 2016, Private Equity Insurance Group, C‑156/15, EU:C:2016:851, paragraphs 25 and 50).</p>

            <p>It should be specified that, in the case which gave rise to that judgment, the Court was being questioned only as to whether Directive 2002/47 fell to be interpreted as conferring on takers of that collateral the right to enforce it notwithstanding the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the provider. However, given that, as can be seen from paragraph 23 above, Article 4(5) of that directive does not distinguish depending on whether insolvency proceedings have been commenced against the provider or the taker, that directive must be interpreted as meaning that the regime introduced thereby also confers on takers of financial collateral the right to enforce that collateral, notwithstanding the commencement of insolvency proceedings against them.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, as was noted by the Advocate General in point 85 of his Opinion, Directive 2002/47 is intended to establish a specific legal regime governing financial collateral arrangements, so as to contribute to the stability of the EU financial system.</p>

            <p>An interpretation of Article 4(5) of that directive whereby the security financial collateral arrangement would become ineffective as a result of the commencement of insolvency proceedings against the taker, preventing that party from effectively recovering its claim from that collateral and obliging the provider, in practice, to pay the taker the amount of that collateral a second time, would be contrary to both the wording of that article and the objectives pursued by Directive 2002/47. Indeed, such an interpretation would result in such an arrangement being rendered ineffective to a large extent and could, as the case may be, cause financial difficulties for that provider, contrary to the objective of limiting contagion effects in case of a default of one of the parties.</p>

            <p>It should be added that, as was noted by the Advocate General in points 59 and 60 of his Opinion, as Article 4(5) of Directive 2002/47 does not specify the way in which the effectiveness of financial collateral is to be ensured notwithstanding the commencement of insolvency proceedings, it is for the Member States to provide for appropriate means of ensuring such effectiveness, which could include a measure whereby the financial collateral is excluded from the collateral taker's assets.</p>

            <p>In the light of all of the foregoing, the answer to the first question is that Article 4(5) of Directive 2002/47 must be interpreted as requiring Member States to adopt rules which enable a taker of collateral provided under a security financial collateral arrangement to recover its claim, arising from a failure to discharge the relevant financial obligations, from that collateral, where the enforcement event occurs after insolvency proceedings have been commenced against that taker.</p>

            <p>31 By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 4(1) and (5) of Directive 2002/47 should be interpreted as requiring the taker of collateral provided under a security financial collateral arrangement to recover its claim, arising from a failure to discharge the financial obligations covered by that arrangement, primarily from that collateral.</p>

            <p>In the first place, regarding the wording of that article, it should be noted that the expression `the collateral taker shall be able to realise', used in paragraph 1 thereof, indicates that, in cases entailing the enforcement of the financial collateral, the taker has the option, rather than an obligation, to realise that collateral. In addition, the phrases `subject to the terms agreed in' and `in accordance with its terms', used in paragraphs 1 and 5 of that article, show that Directive 2002/47 gives priority to the terms of the arrangement.</p>

            <p>As was noted, in essence, by the Advocate General in point 74 of his Opinion, it thus appears that that provision is intended to ensure that the financial collateral arrangement is enforced first and foremost in accordance with the terms of the arrangement as agreed between the parties.</p>

            <p>In the second place, concerning the context of Article 4(1) and (5) of Directive 2002/47, it should be pointed out that the wording of Article 2(1)(l) of that directive, which defines the `enforcement event' as being `an event of default or any similar event as agreed between the parties', on the occurrence of which `the collateral taker is entitled to realise' the financial collateral, confirms the importance of the terms agreed between the parties. This is also apparent from the wording of other provisions of that directive, such as Article 4(4) thereof, which refers to `the terms agreed in the ... financial collateral arrangement'.</p>

            <p>It should also be noted that, where the arrangement does not contain any terms governing that issue, it follows from those objectives that the taker must recover its claim primarily from the collateral provided for that purpose before making use of other assets of the provider. Such a requirement, inasmuch as it enables the provider to avoid paying, in practice, the amount of that collateral which corresponds to its debt a second time, could help prevent contagion effects in the event of the taker's insolvency.</p>

            <p>39 By its third question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Directive 2002/47, in particular Articles 4 and 8 thereof, is to be interpreted as meaning that, in a situation where the taker of collateral provided under a security financial collateral arrangement has recovered its claim, arising from a failure to discharge the relevant financial obligations, from assets of the provider other than that collateral, that provider must be ranked above the other creditors in the insolvency proceedings against that taker, so that it can recover that collateral.</p>

It is not apparent from the statements set out in the request for a preliminary ruling that the referring court is hearing a counterclaim for repayment of the financial collateral brought against that bank, nor that it is called upon to resolve the matters relating to the recovery of Aviabaltika's claim against Ūkio bankas in relation to that collateral in the context of those insolvency proceedings.</p>
