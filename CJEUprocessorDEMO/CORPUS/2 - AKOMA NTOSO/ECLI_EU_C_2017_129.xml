            <p>On 1 July 1992, Petersime concluded a commercial agency contract with the predecessor of Agro, which was subsequently replaced, under a contract signed on 1 August 1996, by Agro itself. Pursuant to that contract, Petersime, as principal, assigned to Agro, as commercial agent, the exclusive sales rights of its products in Turkey. The contract, which was initially concluded for a period of 1 year, provided for an automatic extension, every year, for a further 12 months, unless cancelled by either of the parties by registered letter at least 3 months before the end of the 1-year period. Moreover, that contract stated that it was subject to Belgian law and that only the courts of Ghent (Belgium) had jurisdiction in case of disputes.</p>

            <p>By letter of 26 March 2013, Petersime notified Agro of the termination of the commercial agency contract with effect from 30 June 2013. On 5 March 2014, Agro brought legal proceedings before the rechtbank van Koophandel te Gent (Commercial Court, Ghent, Belgium) seeking an order requiring Petersime to pay compensation for termination of the contract and a goodwill indemnity, the repossession of the remaining stock as well as the payment of outstanding claims.</p>

            <p>It is apparent from the order for reference that, in support of its claims, Agro relies on the protection provided for commercial agents by the Law of 1995. In that regard, Agro claims that the provisions of the latter are applicable in the present case, given that the parties validly chose Belgian law as the law applicable to the contract which they concluded. By contrast, Petersime contends that only Belgian general law is applicable, on the ground that the Law of 1995 applies only to the extent that the commercial agent operates in Belgium, which is not the case in the present situation.</p>

            <p>The referring court notes that the parties made an explicit choice of the applicable law, in this case Belgian law. That court considers however that that does not imply that the Law of 1995 is applicable, since the territorial scope of that law seems to be limited to commercial agents principally established in Belgium. Article 27 of the Law of 1995, as interpreted in Belgian law, leads to the conclusion that that law is self-limiting, so that it loses its mandatory character where the commercial agent does not have its principal establishment in Belgium, regardless of the fact that the parties may have designated Belgian law in general as the applicable law.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the rechtbank van Koophandel te Gent (Commercial Court, Ghent) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling: `Is the Law of 1995, which transposes Directive 86/653 into Belgian national law, in accordance with that directive and/or the provisions of the Association Agreement which has as its express aim the accession of Turkey to the European Union and/or the obligations between Turkey and the European Union to eliminate restrictions with regard to the free movement of services between them, when that law provides that it only applies to commercial agents whose principal place of business is in Belgium, and does not apply when a principal established in Belgium and an agent established in Turkey have explicitly chosen Belgian law?'</p>

            <p>First of all, it should be noted that the observations submitted to the Court reveal a divergence as regards the interpretation of Article 27 of the Law of 1995 and the application of that law, which transposes Directive 86/653, to the situation at issue in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>The parties to the main proceedings, like the referring court, consider that, pursuant to Article 27 of the Law of 1995, as interpreted in the Belgian legal system, that law is not applicable to a commercial agency contract such as that at issue in the main proceedings, under which the principal is established in Belgium and the commercial agent is established in Turkey, where it carries out the activity resulting from that contract, so that, in such circumstances, the commercial agent cannot rely on the protection provided by that law in the event that the contract is terminated, even though the parties to the contract at issue in the main proceedings designated Belgian law as the law governing that contract.</p>

          <content eId="para_1599__content">
            <p>By contrast, the Belgian Government maintains that Article 27 of the Law of 1995 does not have the self-limiting character which the referring court attributes to it, so that that law applies to a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings in which a principal established in Belgium and a commercial agent established in Turkey expressly designated Belgian law as the applicable law.</p>

            <p>In that respect, it should be recalled that, as regards the interpretation of provisions of national law, the Court is in principle required to base its consideration on the description given in the order for reference. It is settled case-law that the Court of Justice does not have jurisdiction to interpret the internal law of a Member State (judgment of 17 March 2011, Naftiliaki Etaireia Thasou and Amaltheia I Naftiki Etaireia, C‑128/10 and C‑129/10, EU:C:2011:163, paragraph 40 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>By its question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Directive 86/653 and/or the Association Agreement must be interpreted as precluding national legislation transposing that directive into the law of the Member State concerned, which excludes from its scope of application a commercial agency contract in the context of which the commercial agent is established in Turkey, where it carries out activities under that contract, and the principal is established in that Member State, so that, in such circumstances, the commercial agent cannot rely on rights which that directive guarantees to commercial agents after the termination of such a commercial agency contract.</p>

            <p>In order to answer the question posed by the referring court, as regards Directive 86/653, it is necessary to determine whether a commercial agent carrying out activities under a commercial agency contract in Turkey, the principal of which is established in a Member State, comes within the scope of application of that directive.</p>

            <p>It should be noted that such a situation is not expressly referred to in Articles 17 and 18 of Directive 86/653 or in the other provisions thereof. However, according to the Court's settled case-law, in interpreting a provision of EU law, it is necessary to consider not only its wording but also the context in which it occurs and the objectives pursued by the rules of which it is part (see, inter alia, judgment of 20 November 2014, Utopia, C‑40/14, EU:C:2014:2389, paragraph 27 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_1605__content">
            <p>In that connection, it is common ground that that directive aims to coordinate the laws of the Member States as regards the legal relationship between the parties to a commercial agency contract (judgment of 23 March 2006, Honyvem Informazioni Commerciali, C‑465/04, EU:C:2006:199, paragraph 18 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>As is clear from the second and third recitals of Directive 86/653, the harmonising measures seek to protect commercial agents in their relations with their principals, to eliminate restrictions on the carrying-on of the activities of commercial agents, to make the conditions of competition within the Community uniform, to promote the security of commercial transactions, and to facilitate trade in goods between Member States by harmonising their legal systems within the area of commercial representation. To those ends, that directive establishes, inter alia, rules governing the conclusion and termination of agency contracts, in Articles 13 to 20 (see, to that effect, judgments of 17 October 2013, Unamar, C‑184/12, EU:C:2013:663, paragraph 37 and the case-law cited, and of 3 December 2015, Quenon K., C‑338/14, EU:C:2015:795, paragraph 23 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In that context, the Court has already held that Articles 17 and 18 of Directive 86/653 are of crucial importance, as they define the level of protection which the European Union legislature considered reasonable to grant commercial agents in the course of the creation of the single market, and that the regime established by that directive for that purpose is mandatory in nature (see judgment of 17 October 2013, Unamar, C‑184/12, EU:C:2013:663, paragraphs 39 and 40).</p>

            <p>Moreover, the Court has stated that the purpose of the regime established in Articles 17 to 19 of that directive is to protect, for all commercial agents, freedom of establishment and the operation of undistorted competition in the internal market, so that those provisions must therefore be observed throughout the Community if those objectives of the FEU Treaty are to be attained (judgment of 9 November 2000, Ingmar, C‑381/98, EU:C:2000:605, paragraph 24).</p>

            <p>Finally, the Court has held that it is essential for the European Union legal order that a principal established in a non-member country, whose commercial agent carries on his activity within the European Union, cannot evade those provisions by the simple expedient of a choice-of-law clause. The purpose served by the provisions in question requires that they be applied where the situation is closely connected with the European Union, in particular where the commercial agent carries on his activity in the territory of a Member State, irrespective of the law by which the parties intended the contract to be governed (judgment of 9 November 2000, Ingmar, C‑381/98, EU:C:2000:605, paragraph 25).</p>

            <p>As regards Article 14 of the Association Agreement, it is clear, admittedly, from the wording of that provision as well as from the objective of that agreement, that the principles enshrined in Articles Article 45 and 46 TFEU, and in the provisions of the Treaty relating to the freedom to provide services, must be extended, so far as possible, to Turkish nationals to eliminate restrictions on the freedom to provide services between the contracting parties (judgment of 21 October 2003, Abatay and Others, C‑317/01 and C‑369/01, EU:C:2003:572, paragraph 112 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In that regard, the Court has already held that the use in Article 14 of the Association Agreement of the verb `to be guided by' indicates that the contracting parties are not obliged to apply the provisions of the Treaty on freedom to provide services or indeed those adopted for the implementation of those provisions but simply to consider them as a source of guidance for the measures to be adopted in order to implement the objectives laid down in that agreement (judgment of 24 September 2013, Demirkan, C‑221/11, EU:C:2013:583, paragraph 45).</p>

            <p>Moreover, with regard, in particular to the association between the European Union and the Republic of Turkey, the Court has already held that, in deciding whether a provision of European Union law lends itself to application by analogy under that association, a comparison must be made between the objective pursued by the Association Agreement and the context of which it forms a part, on the one hand, and those of the European Union law instrument in question, on the other (judgment of 24 September 2013, Demirkan, C‑221/11, EU:C:2013:583, paragraph 48).</p>

            <p>The development of economic freedoms for the purpose of bringing about freedom of movement for persons of a general nature which may be compared to that afforded to European Union citizens under Article 21 TFEU is not the object of the Association Agreement. Neither that agreement nor the Additional Protocol establishes any general principle of freedom of movement of persons between Turkey and the European Union. Furthermore, the Association Agreement guarantees the enjoyment of certain rights only within the territory of the host Member State (see, to that effect, judgment of 24 September 2013, Demirkan, C‑221/11, EU:C:2013:583, paragraph 53).</p>

            <p>By contrast, in the context of EU law, the protection of the freedom of establishment and the freedom to provide services, by means of the regime provided for by Directive 86/653 with respect to commercial agents, is based on the objective of establishing an internal market, conceived as an area without internal borders, by removing all obstacles to the establishment of such a market.</p>
