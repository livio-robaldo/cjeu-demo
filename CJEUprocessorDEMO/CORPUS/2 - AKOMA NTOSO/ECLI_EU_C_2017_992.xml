Within the framework of the conciliation procedure on the said Directive, the Commission undertook to review the consequences of the provisions of that Directive three years after the deadline for transposition of the Directive in particular for the industrial sectors which are most affected. Under these circumstances, it is appropriate not to confer any protection as a Community design for a design which is applied to or incorporated in a product which constitutes a component part of a complex product upon whose appearance the design is dependent and which is used for the purpose of the repair of a complex product so as to restore its original appearance, until the Council has decided its policy on this issue on the basis of a Commission proposal.'</p>

According to the referring court, some of those wheel rims are identical to Porsche's alloy wheel rims. That court observes that, according to Acacia, the rims it manufactures and which are intended for Porsche vehicles can be used only with Porsche vehicles. Porsche submits to that court that the rims in question are also offered in colours and sizes which do not correspond to the original products.</p>

            <p>As the appeal brought by Acacia and Mr D'Amato was dismissed, they brought an appeal on a point of law ( Revision) before the referring court. That court notes that the outcome of the appeal on a point of law depends on whether Acacia may rely on the `repair' clause in Article 110(1) of Regulation No 6/2002. However, the interpretation of that provision raises several difficulties.</p>

In this regard, the Court is not bound either by the Opinion delivered by the Advocate General or by the reasoning which led to that Opinion.

Acacia, the Italian and Netherlands Governments and the Commission maintain, on the other hand, that the application of the `repair' clause is not limited to fixed‑shape parts, namely those parts whose shape is in principle immutably determined by the appearance of the complex product and cannot therefore be freely selected by the customer, so that light alloy wheel rims may be covered by that provision.</p>

That report thus stated that the majority of delegations within that committee called for, first, the wording of the provision at issue to be more closely aligned to that of Article 14 of Directive 98/71 and, secondly, spare parts to be excluded from the protection offered by the future regulation `only where they were used to repair a complex product so as to restore its original appearance'.</p>

            <p>Against that background, the requirement laid down in the wording of the provision at issue, as it appeared in the proposal and the Commission's amended proposal, cited in paragraph 36 of the present judgment, relating to the fact that the product in which the design is incorporated or to which it is applied must be a component part of a complex product `upon whose appearance the design is dependent', was omitted from the final provision adopted by the Council.</p>

However, in the light of the foregoing, that fact does not appear decisive. Moreover, as follows from the case-law of the Court, while the preamble to an EU measure may explain the latter's content, it cannot be relied upon as a ground for derogating from the actual provisions of the measure in question (judgment of 10 January 2006, IATA and ELFAA, C‑344/04, EU:C:2006:10, paragraph 76 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In that context, having regard to the intention of the EU legislature, as recalled in paragraphs 36 to 38 of the present judgment, there is no need for a strict interpretation of Article 110(1) of Regulation No 6/2002, such as that referred to in paragraph 30 of the present judgment, put forward by Audi, Porsche and the German Government, which would be based on the derogatory or transitional nature of that provision.</p>

            <p>In the second place, the interpretation of Article 110(1) of Regulation No 6/2002 in paragraph 34 of the present judgment is borne out by an analysis of the context in which the `repair' clause occurs, that context militating in favour of a consistent interpretation of the provisions of Regulation No 6/2002, on the one hand, and those of Directive 98/71 on the other.</p>

In contrast to the provision of that directive, the `repair' clause, as set out in Directive 98/71, does not contain such a restriction. However, as noted in paragraph 37 of the present judgment, the amendment, during the legislative work that led to the adoption of Regulation No 6/2002, of the wording of the `repair' clause contained in Article 110(1) of that regulation aimed to align that wording more closely with that of Article 14 of Directive 98/71.</p>

            <p>As is apparent from that explanatory memorandum, the protection granted by Community designs may cause adverse effects by removing or restricting competition on markets, as regards, inter alia, long lasting and expensive complex products such as cars, in respect of which the protection of designs that are applied to the particular component parts which make up the complex product may create a veritable captive market for those spare parts. In that context, the purpose of the `repair' clause is to avoid the creation of captive markets in certain spare parts and, in particular, to prevent a consumer who has bought a long lasting and perhaps expensive product from being indefinitely tied, for the purchase of external parts, to the manufacturer of the complex product.</p>

Furthermore, in the absence of any definition of the term `component part' in that regulation, it must be understood in accordance with its usual meaning in everyday language (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 May 2006, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, C‑431/04, EU:C:2006:291, paragraph 17 and the case-law cited).</p>

Thus, the possibility of relying on the `repair' clause requires that the use of the component part be necessary for the repair of a complex product that has become defective, inter alia due to the lack of the original part or damage caused to it.</p>

            <p>In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the third question in Case C‑397/16 and the third and fourth questions in Case C‑435/16 is that Article 110(1) of Regulation No 6/2002 must be interpreted as meaning that, in order to rely on the `repair' clause contained in that provision, the manufacturer or seller of a component part of a complex product are under a duty of diligence as regards compliance by downstream users with the conditions laid down in that provision.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 110(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 6/2002 of 12 December 2001 on Community designs must be interpreted as meaning that the `repair' clause in it does not make the exclusion of protection as a Community design for a design which constitutes a component part of a complex product which is used for the purpose of the repair of that complex product so as to restore its original appearance subject to the condition that the protected design is dependent upon the appearance of the complex product. 2. Article 110(1) of Regulation No 6/2002 must be interpreted as meaning that the `repair' clause in it makes the exclusion of protection as a Community design for a design which constitutes a component part of a complex product which is used for the purpose of the repair of that complex product so as to restore its original appearance subject to the condition that the replacement part must have an identical visual appearance to that of the part which was originally incorporated into the complex product when it was placed on the market. 3. Article 110(1) of Regulation No 6/2002 must be interpreted as meaning that, in order to rely on the `repair' clause contained in that provision, the manufacturer or seller of a component part of a complex product are under a duty of diligence as regards compliance by downstream users with the conditions laid down in that provision.</p>
