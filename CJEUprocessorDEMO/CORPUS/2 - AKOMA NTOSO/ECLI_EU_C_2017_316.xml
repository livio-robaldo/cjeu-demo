            <p>Onix is an insurance company with its head office in Bucharest (Romania). It has been carrying on business in Italy since 24 October 2012, under the freedom to provide services, in particular for contracting authorities, providing surety for private undertakings selected in connection with tendering procedures, in order to guarantee their participation in the public contracts concerned and the execution of such contracts.</p>

First, he was convicted, on 29 July 2013, by the Tribunale di Marsala (District Court, Marsala, Italy) for attempted aggravated fraud against the Italian State. Secondly, that shareholder was, it stated, the sole director of G.C.C. Garanzie Crediti e Cauzioni spA, an Italian company which was removed from the list of financial intermediaries on 28 August 2008 pursuant to a decision of the Banca d'Italia (Bank of Italy) on account of serious management irregularities and non-compliance with minimum equity requirements. In that context, the Bank of Italy imposed an administrative penalty in the amount of EUR 80000. Finally, the funds held by Garanzie Crediti e Cauzioni Srl, an Italian company resulting from the transformation of G.C.C. Garanzie Crediti e Cauzioni spA, were twice the subject of sequestration orders made by the Agenzia delle entrate (tax authority, Italy) on 27 April and 28 May 2010, in order to ensure the performance of surety undertakings not honoured.</p>

            <p>It must be noted, however, that the need for a uniform interpretation of EU regulations makes it impossible, where there are doubts, for the text of a provision to be considered in isolation but requires, on the contrary, that it should be interpreted and applied in the light of the versions existing in the other official languages (judgment of 19 September 2013, Van Buggenhout and Van de Mierop, C‑251/12, EU:C:2013:566, paragraph 27).</p>

            <p>That being so, it must be pointed out that the wording of Article 40(6) of Directive 92/49, considered in isolation, does not enable an answer to be given to the question referred.

            <p>In that regard, it is clear, in the first place, from recitals 1, 5 and 6 of that directive that the latter, which aims to complete the internal market in the sector of direct insurance other than life assurance, is based on two principles.

            <p>In pursuit of that objective, Directive 92/49 provides, first, in Article 4 thereof, that a single authorisation may be sought only from the authorities of the home Member State, Article 6 of that directive laying down the conditions for granting such authorisation, including that of the good repute of the directors of the undertaking concerned. Moreover, it is clear from Article 14 of that directive that it is also for the home Member State to withdraw the authorisation granted to an insurance undertaking which no longer fulfils the conditions for admission or fails seriously in its obligations under the regulations to which it is subject.</p>

            <p>However, it is for the Member State of the provision of services, exercising the prerogatives it has in emergency situations, to establish whether certain inadequacies or uncertainties relating to the good repute of the directors of the insurance undertaking concerned present a real and imminent danger that irregularities will occur to the detriment of the interests of the insured persons or other persons who may benefit from the insurance cover taken out and, if so, to take appropriate measures immediately, such as, where appropriate, prohibiting the conclusion of new contracts in its territory.</p>

            <p>It is apparent from recital 3 of Directive 92/49 that the purpose thereof is to guarantee adequate protection for policy-holders. Such protection could not be ensured if Article 40(6) of that directive were to be interpreted as precluding, in the event of an emergency, the Member State of provision of the services concerned from assessing whether there was an imminent danger to the interests of those policy-holders and immediately taking measures to remedy that situation, without being obliged to refer to the authorities of the home Member State the task of taking appropriate action for that purpose.</p>

            <p>However, to the extent that, as was found in paragraph 42 of this judgment, that directive gives primacy to the principle of supervision of insurance undertakings by the home Member State, the Member State of the provision of services may take, in an emergency, only protective measures. Those measures apply, therefore, only pending a decision by the competent authorities of the home Member State, drawing the conclusions, in the light of the conditions for granting the authorisation, in particular relating to good repute, from the evidence identified by the Member State of the provision of services, as required by the principle of legal certainty which forms part of the EU legal order.</p>

            <p>Consequently, the answer to the question referred is that Directive 92/49 and, in particular, Article 40(6) thereof must be interpreted as precluding the supervisory authorities of a Member State from taking emergency measures, as against an undertaking providing direct insurance other than life assurance operating in its territory under the freedom to provide services, in order to protect the interests of the insured persons and other persons who may benefit from the insurance cover taken out, such as prohibiting it from concluding new insurance contracts in that territory, on the grounds of the failure, whether pre-existing or otherwise, assessed discretionarily, to satisfy a subjective precondition laid down for the purpose of the issue of authorisation to engage in insurance business, such as the requirement of good repute. However, that directive does not preclude that Member State, in exercising the prerogatives it has in emergency situations, from establishing whether certain inadequacies or uncertainties relating to the good repute of the directors of the insurance undertaking concerned present a real and imminent danger that irregularities will occur to the detriment of the interests of the insured persons or other persons who may benefit from the insurance cover taken out and, if so, from taking appropriate measures immediately, such as, where appropriate, prohibiting the conclusion of new contracts in its territory.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules: Council Directive 92/49/EEC of 18 June 1992 on the coordination of laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to direct insurance other than life assurance and amending Directives 73/239/EEC and 88/357/EEC (third non-life insurance Directive) and, in particular, Article 40(6) thereof, must be interpreted as precluding the supervisory authorities of a Member State from taking emergency measures, as against an undertaking providing direct insurance other than life assurance operating in its territory under the freedom to provide services, in order to protect the interests of the insured persons and other persons who may benefit from the insurance cover taken out, such as prohibiting it from concluding new insurance contracts in that territory, on the grounds of the failure, whether pre-existing or otherwise, assessed discretionarily, to satisfy a subjective precondition laid down for the purpose of the issue of authorisation to engage in insurance business, such as the requirement of good repute. However, that directive does not preclude that Member State, in exercising the prerogatives it has in emergency situations, from establishing whether certain inadequacies or uncertainties relating to the insurance undertaking concerned present a real and imminent danger that irregularities will occur to the detriment of the interests of the insured persons or other persons who may benefit from the insurance cover taken out and, if so, from taking appropriate measures immediately, such as, where appropriate, prohibiting the conclusion of new contracts in its territory.</p>
