            <p>Following a complaint by the Bulgarsko druzhestvo za zashtita na ptitsite (Bulgarian Society for the Protection of Birds; `the BDZP'), which is a member of the non-governmental organisation BirdLife International, the Commission sent to the Republic of Bulgaria, on 6 June 2008, a letter of formal notice in which it complained that that Member State did not classify as SPAs the most suitable territories in number and size as regards six IBAs (Rila, Kaliakra, Tsentralen Balkan, Lomovete, Pirin and Zapadni Rodopi), and therefore has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 4(1) and (2) of the Birds Directive.</p>

            <p>In its replies to the letter of formal notice, the Republic of Bulgaria has disputed any failure to comply with the Birds Directive, claiming in particular that part of IBA Rila, the Rilski manastir (Rila monastery, Bulgaria), had, in the meantime, been the subject of an additional classification as an SPA.</p>

            <p>Since it was not satisfied by all those replies, on 17 October 2014 the Commission sent the Republic of Bulgaria a reasoned opinion in which it alleged that it had failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 4(1) of that directive. However, the reasoned opinion concerned only IBA Rila, since, in the meantime, the Kaliakra IBA had been the subject of a specific infringement procedure, on which the Court ruled in its judgment of 14 January 2016, Commission v Bulgaria ( C‑141/14, EU:C:2016:8), and the Tsentralen Balkan, Lomovete, Pirin and Zapadni Rodopi IBAs, meanwhile, had to a great extent been classified as SPAs.</p>

            <p>In relation to IBA Rila, the Commission stated in its reasoned opinion that only 72% of its total area was classified as an SPA, which had the effect of restricting the protection of 17 species listed in Annex I to the Birds Directive.</p>

            <p>On 15 December 2014, the Republic of Bulgaria responded to the reasoned opinion, then, on 7 September 2015 and 3 February 2016 respectively, sent additional information and an update. That Member State also argued, in essence, that the classification of 72% of IBA Rila as an SPA ensured `maximum protection of the species and their habitats, described in the IBA', but that, in a spirit of effective cooperation, the efforts made to examine the question of extending the area of the Rila SPA would be increased.</p>

          <content eId="para_11134__content">
            <p>Firstly, the Republic of Bulgaria asserts that the Commission has altered the subject matter of the proceedings. While the Commission had complained in the letter of formal notice that the Republic of Bulgaria had not classified as SPAs the most suitable territories in number and size for the conservation of the species mentioned in Annex I to the Birds Directive, that institution has, in the reasoned opinion and in the form of order sought in the application, based its claim on the fact that the entirety of IBA Rila had not been classified as an SPA. Thus, the Republic of Bulgaria was not in a position either to comply with the obligations arising from EU law or to defend itself against the complaints formulated.</p>

        <paragraph eId="para_11135">
          <num>13</num>
          <content eId="para_11135__content">
            <p>The Republic of Bulgaria notes that it was certain, on reading the letter of formal notice, that it was sufficient that it ensure sufficient protection of the species mentioned in Annex I to the Birds Directive, such that it has taken the measures necessary to comply with that letter of formal notice. It was only after receiving the reasoned opinion that it found that the Commission was in fact complaining that it had not classified the entire territory of IBA Rila as an SPA.</p>

          <num>14</num>
          <content eId="para_11136__content">
            <p>Secondly, the Republic of Bulgaria is of the view that, both in the reasoned opinion and in the application, the Commission did not properly set out the subject matter of the dispute or give coherent and precise reasons for its view that that Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 4(1) of the Birds Directive.</p>

          <num>15</num>
          <content eId="para_11137__content">
            <p>In particular, it notes that the Commission merely stated in general terms that the classification of only a part of IBA Rila as an SPA had the effect of limiting the protection of 17 species listed in Annex I to the Birds Directive, without, however, providing sufficient elements enabling those species to be identified.</p>
          </content>

          <num>16</num>
          <content eId="para_11138__content">
            <p>In response, the Commission is of the opinion, with regard, firstly, to the alleged alteration of the subject matter of the dispute, that the conclusions of the letter of formal notice and the reasoned opinion are identical and that there is not the slightest mismatch or difference between the two documents. It submits that, in the course of the pre-litigation procedure, taking into account the additional territories which have been classified by the Republic of Bulgaria following the letter of formal notice, the subject matter of the dispute has simply been limited to the residual, unclassified part of IBA Rila.</p>

          <content eId="para_11139__content">
            <p>As regards, secondly, the allegedly insufficient statement of the subject matter of the dispute, the Commission notes that it relied on a specific provision of the Birds Directive and that it provided a list of 17 bird species whose conservation was insufficiently guaranteed due to the classification of only a part of IBA Rila as an SPA and a list of 9 species of birds seriously affected by that incomplete classification.</p>

          <content eId="para_11140__content">
            <p>As regards the complaint alleging an alteration to the subject matter of the dispute, it should be recalled that, according to the Court's settled case-law, the purpose of the letter of formal notice is, firstly, to delimit the subject matter of the dispute and to indicate to the Member State, which is invited to submit its observations, the factors enabling it to prepare its defence and, secondly, to enable the Member State to comply before proceedings are brought before the Court (judgments of 28 March 1985, Commission v Italy, 274/83, EU:C:1985:148, paragraph 19, and of 7 April 2011, Commission v Portugal, C‑20/09, EU:C:2011:214, paragraph 19 and the case-law cited). The opportunity for the Member State concerned to submit its observations, even if it chooses not to avail itself thereof, constitutes an essential guarantee intended by the FEU Treaty, adherence to which is an essential formal requirement of the procedure for finding that a Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations (judgment of 14 April 2011, Commission v Romania, C‑522/09, EU:C:2011:251, paragraph 16).</p>

          <content eId="para_11141__content">
            <p>Nonetheless, although the reasoned opinion must contain a coherent and detailed statement of the reasons which led the Commission to conclude that the Member State in question has failed to fulfil one of its obligations under the Treaty, the letter of formal notice cannot be subject to such strict requirements of precision, since it cannot, of necessity, contain anything more than an initial brief summary of the complaints. There is therefore nothing to prevent the Commission from setting out in detail in the reasoned opinion the complaints which it has already made more generally in the letter of formal notice (see, to that effect, judgments of 8 April 2008, Commission v Italy, C‑337/05, EU:C:2008:203, paragraph 23, and of 13 February 2014, Commission v United Kingdom, C‑530/11, EU:C:2014:67, paragraph 40).</p>

        <paragraph eId="para_11142">
          <num>20</num>
          <content eId="para_11142__content">
            <p>In the present case, it must be noted that, in both the letter of formal notice and the reasoned opinion, the Commission expressly stated that, by not classifying as SPAs the most suitable territories in number and size for the conservation of the species listed in Annex I to the Birds Directive, the Republic of Bulgaria has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 4(1) of that directive.</p>

          <num>21</num>
          <content eId="para_11143__content">
            <p>The only difference between those documents lies in the fact that, in the letter of formal notice, the Commission stated that the Republic of Bulgaria was failing in its obligation to classify as SPAs the most suitable territories for the conservation of the species listed in Annex I to the Birds Directive, whereas in the reasoned opinion and in the application, not being satisfied with the territories classified as such by that Member State following the letter of formal notice, the Commission specified the subject matter of the dispute, by restricting it to the residual, unclassified part of IBA Rila, while referring to the whole of that IBA.</p>

          <num>22</num>
          <content eId="para_11144__content">
            <p>Consequently, having regard to the fact that the entire Rila IBA was included in the list of the most suitable territories in number and size, within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the Birds Directive, the Republic of Bulgaria is not justified in claiming that the Commission has altered the subject matter of the dispute.</p>

            <p>With regard to the complaint alleging an insufficient statement of the subject-matter of the proceedings in the application, it must be noted that, by virtue of Article 120(c) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice and the case-law relating thereto, an application initiating proceedings must state the subject matter of the dispute and include a brief statement of the pleas in law. That statement must be sufficiently clear and precise to enable the defendant to prepare his defence and the Court to rule on the application. It is therefore necessary for the essential points of law and fact on which a case is based to be indicated coherently and intelligibly in the application itself and for the form of order sought to be set out unambiguously so that the Court does not rule ultra petita or fail to rule on a claim (see, to that effect, judgments of 14 January 2010, Commission v Czech Republic, C‑343/08, EU:C:2010:14, paragraph 26; of 15 June 2010, Commission v Spain, C‑211/08 EU:C:2010:340, paragraph 32; and of 15 November 2012, Commission v Portugal, C‑34/11, EU:C:2012:712, paragraph 44).</p>

          <content eId="para_11146__content">
            <p>It is, moreover, settled case-law that the Court must examine whether the reasoned opinion and the action set out the complaints coherently and precisely in order that the Court may appreciate exactly the extent of the alleged infringement of EU law, a condition which is necessary in order to enable the Court to determine whether there has been a breach of obligations as alleged (judgment of 15 November 2012, Commission v Portugal, C‑34/11, EU:C:2012:712, paragraph 43 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_11147__content">
            <p>In the present case, it is appropriate to note that, in the conclusions of the reasoned opinion and the application, the Commission expressly stated that the action for failure to fulfil obligations was based on a failure by the Republic of Bulgaria to have regard to its obligations under Article 4(1) of the Birds Directive.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, in the grounds of the reasoned opinion and the application, the Commission argued that the effect of the merely partial classification of IBA Rila as an SPA was a `considerable restriction' of the protection of 17 species of birds listed in Annex I to that directive, namely the boreal owl ( Aegolius funereus), the hazel grouse ( Bonasa bonasia), the short-toed eagle ( Circaetus gallicus), the white-backed woodpecker ( Dendrocopos leucotus), the black woodpecker ( Dryocopus martius), the peregrine falcon ( Falco peregrinus), the Eurasian pygmy owl ( Glaucidium passerinum), the three-toed woodpecker ( Picoides tridactylus), the capercaillie ( Tetrao urogallus), the golden eagle ( Aquila chrysaetos), the European nightjar ( Caprimulgus europaeus), the corncrake ( Crex crex), the middle spotted woodpecker ( Dendrocopos medius), the Eurasian eagle-owl ( Bubo bubo), the red-backed shrike ( Lanius collurio), the woodlark ( Lullula arborea), the European honey buzzard ( Pernis apivorus), even stating that the first nine of those species were `seriously affected'.</p>

            <p>Firstly, as regards the section of IBA Rila not classified as an SPA, which covers the area at the foot of the Rila Mountains around the boundaries of the Rila SPA and Rilski manastir, the Commission highlights the fact that a large proportion of this section, i.e. 75%, consists of ancient forests, mainly coniferous, conducive for the conservation of the Eurasian pygmy-owl, boreal owl and three-toed woodpecker, of which the biggest breeding populations in the country can be found in these forests, on the one hand, and the golden eagle, the capercaillie, the peregrine falcon, the black woodpecker, the white-backed woodpecker, the Eurasian nightjar and the hazel grouse, on the other. The whole of IBA Rila forms part of priority sites, in Bulgaria and at European Union level, for those species.</p>

Given that the Republic of Bulgaria has not adduced any other scientific data to justify only part of IBA Rila being classified as an SPA, the Commission recalls that, according to the settled case-law of the Court, the list of areas of importance for the conservation of birds in Europe ( `the IBA list'), constitutes the most up-to-date and accurate reference for the identification of the sites most suitable in number and size for the conservation of the species listed in Annex I to the Birds Directive.</p>

            <p>It reiterates that the mere fact that a site is appropriate for the conservation of certain species is not sufficient to found an obligation to classify that site as an SPA. In that regard, the national authorities have a better knowledge of the local situation. In addition, the updating of scientific data is necessary to determine the situation of the most endangered species and that of the species constituting the common heritage of the European Union in order to classify the most suitable areas as SPAs. In that regard, a very small presence in number of populations of species in certain territories would not be sufficient to consider those areas as the most suitable for the conservation of the species in question.</p>

It adds that, on the basis of the discretion enjoyed by the Member States in the application of the ornithological criteria for identifying the most suitable sites for conservation of the species listed in Annex I to the Birds Directive, it drew a distinction between, on the one hand, the most important territories for the conservation of targeted bird species, referred to in Article 4(1) of that directive, and, on the other, those sites which are smaller and are subject to severe anthropogenic pressure.</p>

            <p>The Republic of Bulgaria disputes the Commission's reasoning that the IBAs necessarily constitute the most suitable territories in number and size, within the meaning of Article 4(1) of the Birds Directive. According to that Member State, although the IBA inventory constitutes, in the absence of scientific proof to the contrary, a basis of reference for assessing whether that Member State has classified as SPAs sufficient territories in number and size to provide protection for all the bird species listed in Annex I to the Birds Directive, such an inventory is not legally binding (judgment of 7 December 2000, Commission v France, C‑374/98, EU:C:2000:670, paragraph 25).

            <p>Thus, it submits, first of all, that it is for the Commission to prove that a particular site must be designated as an SPA. In the application, the Commission states that the Republic of Bulgaria does not deny the importance of IBA Rila for the conservation of birds. In so doing, the Commission distorts the arguments presented by the Republic of Bulgaria during the pre-litigation period. In fact, the present action does not concern the importance of IBA Rila for the conservation of birds. The Republic of Bulgaria maintains in that regard that the classification of 72% of IBA Rila is such as to ensure a maximum level of protection of species and their habitats. Next, the Commission refers, in its application, to data contained in a table provided by the Republic of Bulgaria in the additional information of July 2009 and draws certain conclusions from those data. However, it is not possible to determine on what precise data the Commission relies in that regard. Finally, according to the Commission, it is clear from the available data and analyses that there is restricted coverage for 17 bird species listed in Annex I to the Birds Directive. However, it would appear that the Commission's findings are based mainly on information, the relevance and reliability of which are doubtful, from non-governmental bodies.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, the Republic of Bulgaria submits that the Commission does not provide any evidence in support of its claim. It submits that there are no definitive scientific data demonstrating the need to classify the whole of IBA Rila as an SPA and that the data on which the Commission's action is founded are not reliable or up to date. In March 2014, the Republic of Bulgaria provided the Commission with data from the report referred to in Article 12 of the Birds Directive relating to the bird species in question, which data were not taken into account in either the reasoned opinion or the application. In that regard, that Member State sends a series of data which, it alleges, cast doubt on the accuracy of the BDZP data used by the Commission, such that it is necessary to collect additional scientific data. The data from the BDZP themselves give rise to doubts as to the need to classify the entirety of IBA Rila as an SPA. In that context, even though it is for the BDZP to make the selection and the initial assessment of regions which are IBAs in Bulgaria, it has not submitted either to the competent Bulgarian authorities or to scientific experts the information which it holds concerning the ornithological data for the areas outside the designated SPAs.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the Republic of Bulgaria is of the opinion that the Commission has not explained the methodology and the studies which have led it to the conclusion that the current classification of part of IBA Rila as an SPA is insufficient.

The Republic of Bulgaria submits that more current data have been presented to the Ministry of the Environment as part of the draft Management Plan of Rila National Park for 2015 to 2024.

The Republic of Bulgaria maintains that it has, in any event, the right to establish the hierarchy of its priorities. Second, the reason for the lack of classification of the Rila buffer SPA as initially intended is not, as the Commission maintains, the unreliability of the data available, but the lack of current and unambiguous data showing the need for its classification. Third, as regards the alleged intention of following one single timetable for the selection of the SPAs and sites of European importance, the Republic of Bulgaria states that it did not rely on that argument in order to justify the failure to classify the entirety of IBA Rila as an SPA.</p>

            <p>In that regard, the Court has held that the Member States' margin of discretion in choosing the most suitable territories for classification as SPAs concerns not the appropriateness of classifying as SPAs the territories which appear most suitable according to ornithological criteria, but only the application of those criteria for identifying the most suitable territories for conservation of the species listed in Annex I to the Birds Directive (judgment of 14 January 2016, Commission v Bulgaria, C‑141/14, EU:C:2016:8, paragraph 29 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>As is apparent from the case-law cited in the preceding paragraph, and as the Commission rightly pointed out, on the one hand, while it is true that Member States have some discretion with regard to the choice of SPAs, a decision on their classification and delimitation must be based solely on the ornithological criteria laid down in the Birds Directive. Consequently, by having drawn a distinction, in order to identify the most suitable territories for classification as SPAs, between the most important territories for the conservation of the species referred to in Article 4(1) of that directive, and the less significant territories subject to severe anthropogenic pressure, the Republic of Bulgaria did not stay within the limits of the discretion enjoyed by the Member States.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, since, by virtue of Article 4(1) of the Birds Directive, the Member States are to classify in particular the most suitable territories in number and size as SPAs for the conservation of these species, a Member State cannot, on the ground that it has discretion as regards the choice of SPAs, classify as SPAs sites the number and total area of which are manifestly less than the number and total area of the sites considered to be the most suitable (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 May 1998, Commission v Netherlands, C‑3/96, EU:C:1998:238, paragraph 63).</p>

            <p>With regard, firstly, to the alleged lack of reliability of the scientific and legal data put forward by the Commission, it should be noted that of those data, a part of which was provided by the Bulgarian authorities themselves, were subject, between 2007 and 2010, to a series of assessments carried out by the BAN, the BDZP and ad hoc working groups comprising experts representing the Bulgarian authorities, academia and non-governmental organisations, and were subsequently discussed and updated at meetings of experts within the NSBR.</p>

            <p>Similarly, with regard to the results of the NSBR meetings of 11 March 2011 and 22 March 2016, after which the Republic of Bulgaria decided to defer its decision on the possible classification of the Rila buffer site as an SPA, it should be noted that the NSBR could not reach consensus as to that classification because, on the one hand, of the opposition not of the scientific experts but of officials from the various ministries involved in the procedure and the mayors and, on the other, constraints connected with the internal procedure for classification as SPAs.</p>

That inventory, although not legally binding on the Member States concerned, contains scientific evidence making it possible to assess whether a Member State has complied with its obligation flowing from that provision (see, to that effect, judgment of 7 December 2000, Commission v France, C‑374/98, EU:C:2000:670, paragraphs 25 and 26).</p>
