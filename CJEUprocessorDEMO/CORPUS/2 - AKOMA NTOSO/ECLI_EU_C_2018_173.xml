            <p>Saey Home &amp; Garden raised a plea of lack of jurisdiction of the Portuguese courts to hear the dispute in the main proceedings, arguing, first, that the goods concerned were loaded in Belgium and that Lusavouga was responsible for the transport and, second, that paragraph 20 of the general terms and conditions to which the sale of those goods were subject contained a jurisdiction clause providing that disputes would be decided by the courts of Kortrijk (Courtai, Belgium).</p>

            <p>The Tribunal de Comarca de Aveiro (District Court, Aveiro) dismissed the plea of lack of jurisdiction and held that the Portuguese courts had international jurisdiction on the basis of Article 7(1)(a) of Regulation No 1215/2012.</p>

            <p>Saey Home &amp; Garden brought an appeal against that decision before the referring court, the Tribunal da Relação do Porto (Court of Appeal, Porto, Portugal) arguing, in particular, that the commercial concession agreement at issue in the main proceedings requires the supply of services in Spain, so that that Member State is the place of performance of the contractual obligations. Furthermore, Saey Home &amp; Garden argues that the wrongful termination of a contract is covered by `matters relating to contract' within the meaning of Article 7(1)(a) of Regulation No 1215/2012, which excludes the jurisdiction of the Portuguese courts.</p>

            <p>In their written submissions, the Portuguese Government and the European Commission express doubts as to the admissibility of the present request for a preliminary ruling on the ground, in particular, that it has certain shortcomings, such as, inter alia, a description of the facts of the dispute in the main proceedings which is difficult to understand, the failure of the referring court to comment on the findings on which the decision to make this request is based and the repetition of some of the questions referred.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be noted that, according to settled case-law, questions on the interpretation of EU law referred by a national court in the factual and legislative context which that court is responsible for defining, and the accuracy of which is not a matter for the Court to determine, enjoy a presumption of relevance. The Court may refuse to give a ruling on a question referred by a national court for a preliminary ruling, under Article 267 TFEU, only where, for instance, the requirements concerning the content of a request for a preliminary ruling, set out in Article 94 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court, are not satisfied or where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of a provision of European Union law, or the assessment of its validity, which is sought by the national court bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or to its purpose or where the problem is hypothetical (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 March 2017, Rosneft, C‑72/15, EU:C:2017:236, paragraphs 50 and 155 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>According to settled case-law, the need to provide an interpretation of EU law which will be of use to the national court makes it necessary for the national court to define the factual and legal context of the questions it is asking or, at the very least, to explain the factual circumstances on which those questions are based. The order for reference must also set out the precise reasons why the national court is unsure as to the interpretation of EU law and considers it necessary to refer a question to the Court for a preliminary ruling (judgment of 14 June 2017, Online Games and Others, C‑685/15, EU:C:2017:452, paragraph 43 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Furthermore, it is common ground, according to the referring court, that the subject matter of the dispute at issue in the main proceedings concerns a commercial concession agreement for which compensation is sought for loss arising from the premature and sudden termination together with a good will indemnity for failing to observe the related requirement of semi-exclusivity. Therefore, it is important to verify, which is also a matter for the referring court, whether the jurisdiction clause at issue in the main proceedings concerns that legal relationship. In principle, a jurisdiction clause may produce effects only in the relations between the parties who have given their agreement to the conclusion of that contract (judgment of 7 February 2013, Refcomp, C‑543/10, EU:C:2013:62, paragraph 29).</p>

            </tblock>
            <p>33 By those questions, which must be dealt with together, the referring court asks essentially about the interpretation to be given to Article 7(1) of Regulation No 1215/2012 in order to determine which court has jurisdiction to hear an application for damages relating to the termination of a commercial concession agreement concluded between two companies each established and operating in a different Member State, for the marketing of goods on the domestic market of a third Member State in which neither of those companies has a branch or establishment.</p>

            <p>First of all, it should be pointed out that the connecting factors for determining the court with jurisdiction that are laid down in Article 7(1)(b) of Regulation No 1215/2012 are applicable only in so far as the national court hearing the dispute which has arisen between the parties that entered into a long-standing business relationship with each other comes to the conclusion that that relationship is founded on a `contract for the sale of goods' or a `contract for the provision of services', for the purposes of that provision. Such a classification would exclude the application of the rule of jurisdiction laid down in Article 7(1)(a) thereof. In view of the hierarchy which Article 5(1)(c) establishes between Article 5(1)(a) and (b), the rule of jurisdiction laid down in Article 5(1)(a) is intended to apply only in the alternative and if the rules of jurisdiction in Article 5(1)(b) do not apply (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 July 2016, Granarolo, C‑196/15, EU:C:2016:559, paragraphs 30 and 31 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the first place, Article 7(1)(b), first and second indents, of Regulation No 1215/2012 must be interpreted in order to determine whether a commercial concession agreement, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, constitutes a contract for the `sale of goods' or the `provision of services' within the meaning of that provision.</p>

            <p>For that purpose, it is necessary to take the obligation which characterises the contract as the connecting factor for determining the competent court (see, to that effect, judgments of 25 February 2010, Car Trim, C‑381/08, EU:C:2010:90, paragraphs 31 and 32, and of 15 June 2017, Kareda, C‑249/16, EU:C:2017:472, paragraph 40 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>As to whether a contract may be classified as a `contract for the supply of services', within the meaning of Article 7(1)(b), second indent, of Regulation No 1215/2012, it must be recalled that the concept of `services' implies, at the least, that the party who provides the service carries out a particular activity in return for remuneration (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 June 2017, Kareda, C‑249/16, EU:C:2017:472, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>As regards the criterion relating to the existence of an activity, it is clear from the case-law of the Court that it requires the performance of positive acts, rather than mere omissions. That criterion corresponds, in the case of a concession agreement, to the characteristic service provided by the concessionaire which, by distributing the products of the grantor of the concession, is involved in increasing their distribution. As a result of the supply guarantee it enjoys under the concession agreement and, as the case may be, its involvement in the grantor's commercial planning, in particular with respect to marketing operations, factors in respect of which the national court has jurisdiction to make a ruling, the concessionaire is able to offer clients services and benefits that a mere reseller cannot and thereby acquire, for the benefit of the grantor's products, a larger share of the local market (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 December 2013, Corman-Collins, C‑9/12, EU:C:2013:860, paragraph 38 and the case-law cited).</p>

Account must be taken, first, of the competitive advantage conferred on the concessionaire by the benefit, by virtue of the contract concluded between the parties, of an exclusive or semi-exclusive right to sell the grantor's products in a particular territory and, second, assistance provided to the concessionaire regarding access to advertising, communicating know-how by means of training or yet even payment facilities, all of which represent an economic value for the concessionaire that may be regarded as constituting remuneration (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 December 2013, Corman-Collins, C‑9/12, EU:C:2013:860, paragraphs 39 and 40).</p>
