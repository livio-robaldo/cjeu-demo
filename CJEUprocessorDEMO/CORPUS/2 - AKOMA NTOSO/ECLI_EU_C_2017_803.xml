Under agenda item 1.2: • set protection levels for the broadcasting service below 694 MHz commensurate with the results of the studies performed by the Conférence Européenne des Postes et Télécommunications [European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations] and set the lower band edge at 694 MHz; • not add additional constraints for the protection of broadcasting in the band 694-790 MHz although measures can be adopted to ensure the balanced coexistence between wireless broadband and existing aeronautical radionavigation systems on the eastern borders of the EU in the 694-790 MHz band. 3. Under agenda item 1.18: allocate the band 77.5-78 GHz to the radiolocation service and safeguard the use of that band for automotive radars without introducing excessive restrictions, but recognising that radio astronomy stations should continue to benefit from protection. 4. Under agenda item 10: an agenda item for [the World Radiocommunication Conference 2019 (WRC-19)] addressing the spectrum needs for 5G mobile systems should be supported, with the focus above 6 GHz for new allocations and a common approach to launch related compatibility studies ahead of WRC-19. 5. When negotiating any relevant amendment to the ITU Radio Regulations at WRC-15, ensure compliance with Union law, in particular that the principles set out in Article 9 of [the Framework Directive] and [Decision No 243/2012] are respected, and do not bear any prejudice to its further foreseeable development.'</p>

            <p>In that regard, the Commission states that, when the Council adopts a decision under Article 218(9) TFEU, it is to act by a qualified majority. The voting rules that are to apply to the adoption of an act such as Council conclusions are, however, in practice, subject to differences of opinion between the European Union institutions. The Council has, on several occasions, taken the view that such acts are to be adopted by consensus, meaning that such acts cannot be adopted if one Member State opposes their adoption. The Commission considers that such voting rules do not comply with the Treaties. According to the Commission, it follows from Article 16(3) TEU, which provides that `the Council shall act by qualified majority, except where the Treaties provide otherwise', that such acts must be adopted by qualified majority. The present case shows, the Commission claims, that a search for consensus, instead of a qualified majority, is likely to lead to a different result, negatively affecting European Union policy.</p>

            <p>The Commission claims, in that regard, that the provisions of the contested act diverge from its proposal of 29 May 2015. Most of the changes have been made precisely to ensure that the content of the contested act corresponds to the form that the Council decided to choose. First, the contested act contains no indication of its legal basis. Contrary to what is claimed by the Council, the Commission considers that that omission is not a purely formal defect. Second, instead of making use of extensive recitals to explain why the act was to be adopted, the Council confined itself to `recalling' a list of European Union acts adopted in the relevant policy area. Third, the Commission argues that, instead of deciding that the Member States, acting jointly in the interest of the European Union, `shall take' certain positions at WRC-15, the contested act states that the Council `expresses its broad support' for the objectives to be achieved in the negotiations at WRC-15 and `invites Member States' to pursue certain objectives during these negotiations.</p>

Such a requirement is not however apt to ensure strong and unified external representation of the European Union on the international stage and, consequently, fails to achieve the objectives set by the Treaties.</p>

The Council adds that, given that the Commission did not alter its proposal of 29 May 2015 during the proceedings that led to the adoption of the European Union position, in order to take on board the amendments on which agreement within the Council was about to be reached, it follows from Article 293(1) TFEU that the Council had to act unanimously.</p>

            <p>As regards, first, the form of the contested act, it must be recalled that the Treaties set up a system of allocation of powers among the EU institutions, assigning to each institution its own role in the institutional structure of the European Union and the accomplishment of the tasks entrusted to the European Union. Accordingly, Article 13(2) TEU provides that each institution is to act within the limits of the powers conferred on it in the Treaties, and in conformity with the procedures, conditions and objectives set out therein. That provision reflects the principle of institutional balance, characteristic of the institutional structure of the European Union, a principle which requires that each of the institutions must exercise its powers with due regard for the powers of the other institutions (judgment of 28 July 2016, Council v Commission, C‑660/13, EU:C:2016:616, paragraphs 31 and 32 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Accordingly, as the Court has repeatedly held, in so far as the rules regarding the manner in which the EU institutions arrive at their decisions are laid down in the Treaties and are not within the discretion of the Member States or of the institutions themselves, the Treaties alone may, in particular cases, empower an institution to amend a decision-making procedure established by the Treaties (judgment of 6 September 2017, Slovakia and Hungary v Council, C‑643/15 and C‑647/15, EU:C:2017:631, paragraph 149).</p>

            <p>In this case, it must, first, be emphasised that, contrary to what is suggested by the Council, the practice of the institutions, and in particular, with respect to the present case, an alleged consistent practice in relation to the preparation of the EU position for the purposes of the world radiocommunication conferences by means of conclusions, a practice which is contradicted by the position maintained by the Commission in this action, cannot alter the rules of the Treaties that the institutions are obliged to respect. In accordance with settled case-law, a mere practice on the part of the Council cannot derogate from the rules of the Treaty and cannot therefore create a precedent that is binding on the EU institutions (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 May 2008, Parliament v Council, C‑133/06, EU:C:2008:257, paragraph 60 and the case-law cited, and Opinion 1/08 (Agreements modifying the Schedules of Specific Commitments under the GATS) of 30 November 2009, EU:C:2009:739, paragraph 172 and the case-law cited].</p>

            <p>Second, as regards the Council's argument based on paragraph 9 of the judgment of 11 November 1981, IBM v Commission ( 60/81, EU:C:1981:264), according to which the form in which acts or decisions are cast is, in principle, immaterial as regards the question whether they are intended to have legal effects, it must be observed that the case-law stemming from that judgment is relevant to the question of determining whether an act is one against which an action for annulment may be brought. However, it can in no way be inferred from that case-law that the institutions of the European Union are free to derogate from the form of the act laid down by the relevant Treaty provision.</p>

            <p>The fact that an institution of the European Union derogates from the legal form laid down by the Treaties constitutes an infringement of essential procedural requirements that is such as to require the annulment of the act concerned, since that derogation is likely to create uncertainty as to the nature of that act or as to the procedure to be followed for its adoption, thereby undermining legal certainty.</p>

            <p>In this case, the adoption of the contested act in the form of conclusions creates uncertainty as to the legal nature and scope of that act. As the Advocate General also observed in points 69 to 72 of his Opinion, whereas the Council maintains that the act concerned constitutes `in substance' a Council decision, establishing the position to be adopted on the European Union's behalf at WRC-15, the Czech Republic and the French Republic characterise the act as a common position of the European Union and the Member States, and the Federal Republic of Germany regards it as a position that all the Member States had coordinated in the form of Council conclusions. Further, the Council submits that the contested act is binding, whereas the Czech Republic is of the opinion that only certain parts of that act are legally binding, the parts that cover aspects which, according to that Member State, fall under the competence of the European Union, and the Federal Republic of Germany considers that that act constitutes non-binding conclusions. The Commission, for its part, claims that the Council, by adopting the contested act in the form of conclusions, chose a legal form that is generally reserved for acts that are not binding.</p>

            <p>The wording used in the contested act adds, it may be said, to that uncertainty. Whereas the Commission proposal of 29 May 2015 concerned a `Council Decision' on the position `to be adopted, on behalf of the European Union', at WRC-15, the contested act consists of the Council, as paragraph 3 of that act is worded, `express[ing] its broad support' for a set of objectives to be achieved at WRC-15 in view of the successful implementation of relevant Union policies and, according to its paragraph 4, `invit[ing] Member States' to pursue those objectives and to respect the principles set out in Decision No 243/2012 when negotiating amendments to the ITU Radio Regulations at WRC-15. As stated by the Commission, the use of such wording is incompatible with the requirement that a decision of an EU institution under Article 288 TFEU must be binding. Moreover, there is nothing in the contested act to suggest that the Member States are obliged to adopt a position `on the Union's behalf' at WRC-15, contrary to what is provided in Article 218(9) TFEU.</p>

            <p>The choice of the appropriate legal basis has constitutional significance, since, having only conferred powers, the European Union must link the acts which it adopts to provisions of the FEU Treaty which actually empower it to adopt such acts (Opinion 1/15 (EU-Canada PNR Agreement) of 26 July 2017, EU:C:2017:592, paragraph 71).</p>

          <content eId="para_2014__content">
            <p>Further, the indication of the legal basis is of particular significance in order to preserve the prerogatives of the EU institutions concerned by the procedure for the adoption of a measure (see, to that effect, judgment of 1 October 2009, Commission v Council, C‑370/07, EU:C:2009:590, paragraph 48).</p>

            <p>Thus, in the present case, such an indication is liable to have an effect on the powers of the Commission and of the Council and on their respective roles in the procedure for the adoption of the contested act. In the same way, an indication of the legal basis is necessary in order to determine the voting procedure within the Council (see, by analogy, judgment of 1 October 2009, Commission v Council, C‑370/07, EU:C:2009:590, paragraph 48). In particular, since the contested act does not correspond to any of the situations mentioned in the second subparagraph of Article 218(8) TFEU, the Council must, in principle, in accordance with the provisions, read together, of the first subparagraph of Article 218(8) and Article 218(9) TFEU, act by qualified majority when adopting that act (see, to that effect, judgment of 18 December 2014, United Kingdom v Council, C‑81/13, EU:C:2014:2449, paragraph 66).</p>

          <content eId="para_2016__content">
            <p>Moreover, it must be recalled that an indication of the legal basis is essential in the light of the obligation to state reasons that stems from Article 296 TFEU. That obligation, which is justified in particular by the need for the Court to be able to exercise its power of judicial review, must apply to all European Union acts that produce legal effects (see, to that effect, judgment of 1 October 2009, Commission v Council, C‑370/07, EU:C:2009:590, paragraphs 42 and 45).</p>

          <content eId="para_2017__content">
            <p>Last, the requirement of legal certainty means that the binding nature of any act intended to have legal effects must be derived from a provision of EU law which prescribes the legal form to be taken by that act and which must be expressly indicated therein as its legal basis (judgment of 14 June 2016, Commission v McBride and Others, C‑361/14 P, EU:C:2016:434, paragraph 47).</p>

            <p>In this case, the contested act is an act of the European Union, given that it was adopted by the Council, and it has legal effects, in that it determines the objectives that it invites the Member States to pursue at WRC-15. It follows that the Council ought to have indicated, in the contested act, the substantive and procedural legal basis on which that act was adopted.</p>

            <p>Moreover, while it is true that failure to refer to a specific provision of the Treaty need not necessarily constitute an infringement of essential procedural requirements if the legal basis for a measure may be determined from other parts of the measure, as claimed by the Council, such explicit reference is, however, indispensable where, in its absence, the parties concerned and the Court are left uncertain as to the specific legal basis (see, inter alia, judgment of 14 June 2016, Commission v McBride and Others, C‑361/14 P, EU:C:2016:434, paragraph 48).</p>

            <p>In this case, however, instead of indicating the legal basis for the contested act, the Council did no more than, in paragraph 1 of that act, recall the relevant legal background and the Council's institutional practice, and, in paragraph 2 of that act, take note of the RPSG Opinion of February 2015 on common policy objectives for WRC-15. It follows from that finding, allied to those stated in paragraph 46 of the present judgment, that there is nothing in the contested act that makes it possible to determine its substantive and procedural legal basis.</p>

            <p>It follows that the legal basis of the contested act cannot be clearly determined. That being the case, contrary to what is argued by the Council, the failure, in the contested act, to indicate any legal basis cannot be regarded as a purely formal defect (see, to that effect, judgment of 1 October 2009, Commission v Council, C‑370/07, EU:C:2009:590, paragraphs 60 and 61).</p>

            <p>Accordingly, the derogation from the legal form laid down by Article 218(9) TFEU and the failure to indicate the legal basis are the source of confusion as to the legal nature and scope of the contested act and as to the procedure that had to be followed for its adoption, a confusion that was apt to weaken the European Union in the defence of its position at WRC-15 (see, by analogy, judgment of 1 October 2009, Commission v Council, C‑370/07, EU:C:2009:590, paragraph 49).</p>
