                    <p>Definitions of regulated market and MTF [Multilateral Trading Facility] should be introduced and closely aligned with each other to reflect the fact that they represent the same organised trading functionality. The definitions should exclude bilateral systems where an investment firm enters into every trade on own account and not as a riskless counterparty interposed between the buyer and seller. The term ``system '' encompasses all those markets that are composed of a set of rules and a trading platform as well as those that only function on the basis of a set of rules. Regulated markets and MTFs are not obliged to operate a ``technical '' system for matching orders. A market which is only composed of a set of rules that governs aspects related to membership, admission of instruments to trading, trading between members, reporting and, where applicable, transparency obligations is a regulated market or an MTF within the meaning of this Directive and the transactions concluded under those rules are considered to be concluded under the systems of a regulated market or an MTF. The term ``buying and selling interests '' is to be understood in a broad sense and includes orders, quotes and indications of interest. The requirement that the interests be brought together in the system by means of non-discretionary rules set by the system operator means that they are brought together under the system's rules or by means of the system's protocols or internal operating procedures (including procedures embodied in computer software). ...'</p>

            <p>It is clear from the order for reference that the EFS system is a separate trading system in which only shares in `open end' investment funds are traded. Its members include fund agents and brokers. The brokers collect the investors' purchase and sale orders and pass them on to the fund agent of the investment fund concerned. Transactions take place on the basis of `forward pricing', in the sense that when a broker places an order with a fund agent by 16.00, the fund agent executes it at 10.00 the following day on the basis of the net asset value of the investment fund, adjusted in order to take into account the transaction costs.</p>

            <p>Since the Rechtbank Rotterdam (District Court, Rotterdam, Netherlands) dismissed the action brought against that confirmation decision, the applicants in the main proceedings appealed to the referring court, which asks whether or not the EFS system is a `regulated market' as defined in Directive 2004/39.</p>

          <content eId="para_3805__content">
            <p>First, the referring court considers that the EFS system appears to be more in the nature of a bilateral system in which, as is apparent, inter alia, from recital 6 of Directive 2004/39, transactions take place exclusively between the investment fund and the investor. In that regard, it points out that, in the EFS system, the fund agent and the broker represent the investment fund and the investor respectively and that the former always executes the orders of the latter.</p>

          <content eId="para_3806__content">
            <p>Second, the referring court notes that there are no reporting requirements regarding transactions concluded through the EFS system. According to the referring court, inasmuch as recital 6 of Directive 2004/39 refers to regulated market rules concerning, inter alia, reporting obligations, it may be inferred that a system in which the only transactions carried out are those which are not subject to a reporting obligation cannot be regarded as a `regulated market'.</p>

          <content eId="para_3807__content">
            <p>In that context, the referring court is of the view that it follows from Commission Regulation (EC) No 1287/2006 of 10 August 2006 implementing Directive 2004/39/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards record-keeping obligations for investment firms, transaction reporting, market transparency, admission of financial instruments to trading, and defined terms for the purposes of that Directive ( OJ 2006 L 241, p. 1) that primary market transactions are not subject to a reporting obligation so that a system such as the EFS system, in which only primary market transactions are conducted, cannot be regarded as a `regulated market'.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, the referring court does not exclude the argument to the contrary, namely that the EFS system is a regulated market within the meaning of Article 4(1)(14) of Directive 2004/39. It points out that that system is operated independently by Euronext, which has been granted an operating licence in that regard. The referring court considers that the EFS system may be regarded as a multilateral system since multiple brokers and fund agents are affiliated to it, the shares of several investment funds are traded in it and several parties place orders in it. According to the referring court, the term `third party' used in that provision, interpreted in the light of common usage, must refer to any user of that system. In addition, buying and selling interests are each brought together within the EFS system, giving rise to contracts, and its operation is subject to the non-discretionary rules contained in two documents entitled ` EFS Trading Manual' and ` TCS-web user Guide to the EFS'.</p>

            <p>In that regard, according to the order for reference, the EFS system does, in fact, display some of the characteristics of a regulated market described in that definition. Thus, according to the referring court, it is operated by Euronext and is subject to certain non-discretionary rules, namely those contained in two documents published by that institution, entitled ` EFS Trading Manual' and ` TCS-web user Guide to the EFS'. An order placed in the EFS system by a broker with an agent of an investment fund results in a contract in respect of shares in that fund. In addition, Euronext has been authorised to operate the EFS system and there is nothing to suggest that it does not comply with the provisions of Title III of Directive 2004/39; it is for the referring court to verify whether that is the case.</p>

            <p>In that context, the Court cannot accept the argument that the EFS system appears to be more in the nature of a bilateral system, given that there is, in fact, always an investment fund which executes the order from an investor within its own system. As the Advocate General stated in point 92 of his Opinion, such an argument ignores the involvement of Euronext, which operates the EFS system as an independent operator in respect of such transactions. There is no such involvement in bilateral trading.</p>

            <p>In that regard, as the United Kingdom Government observes, the fact that, in a system such as the EFS system, there is no trading between the various brokers or between the various investment fund agents is irrelevant in so far as, within that system, the agents can conclude transactions with multiple brokers and vice versa.</p>

In the light, inter alia, of the broad understanding of the term `buying and selling interests' set out in recital 6 of Directive 2004/39, that term cannot be interpreted as excluding positions of a participant in a trading system on the sole ground that they arise from an obligation to purchase or issue such shares.</p>

            <p>In the third place, the referring court and the applicants in the main proceedings point to certain characteristics of the EFS system, namely the lack of an obligation to report transactions executed through that system, the primary nature of those transactions, the fact that prices are established not directly as a result of supply and demand but on the basis of the net value of the shares bought or sold, as fixed on the day following an order being placed, and the low risk of market abuse and insider trading.

            <p>, the United Kingdom Government and the European Commission state in their written observations, that provision does not set out any further information or limitation on the functioning of a regulated market as regards whether or not transactions must be reported, their primary or secondary nature or price formation.</p>

            <p>As regards, more particularly, reporting transactions, it should be noted that the statement in recital 6 of Directive 2004/39 that a market only composed of a set of rules that governs aspects related inter alia to reporting obligations is a regulated market or an MTF merely means that it is sufficient, for the purpose of its characterisation as a regulated market or an MTF, for a market to display those characteristics.

            <p>As to the argument, in essence, that it is unnecessary to characterise the EFS system as a regulated market in view of the low risk of abuse in the execution of transactions, that argument cannot succeed. As the Commission states in its written observations, the provisions of Directive 2004/39 concerning regulated markets are not intended merely to prevent abuse. As follows, inter alia, from recitals 2 and 5 of that directive, those provisions aim, more broadly, at the harmonisation needed to offer investors a high level of protection, by establishing a comprehensive regulatory regime governing the execution of transactions in respect of financial instruments so as to ensure a high quality of execution of transactions and to uphold the integrity and overall efficiency of the financial system.</p>
