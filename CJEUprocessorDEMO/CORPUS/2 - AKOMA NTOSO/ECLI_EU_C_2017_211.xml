            <p>On 21 May 2014, FlibTravel and Léonard Travel brought an action against the defendants in the main proceedings before the président du tribunal de commerce francophone de Bruxelles (President of the Commercial Court (French-speaking), Brussels, Belgium) seeking an order preventing the continuation of practices which the former claim are acts contrary to honest market practice, in so far as they are carried out in breach of Article 2(1)(c) and (d) of the Order of 27 April 1995.</p>

            <p>In support of their action seeking that order, they submit that the defendants in the main proceedings, or persons working on their behalf, tout for custom among passengers at the Bruxelles-Midi train station who are travelling to Charleroi Airport in order to group them together in `van-type taxis' to subsequently, when those taxis are full, drive them to that destination. They therefore allege that those defendants, in particular, group passengers together who have the same destination, charge for the service by passenger and not by car and tout for custom.</p>

            <p>That court takes the view that under Article 2(1)(c) and (d) of the Order of 27 April 1995, taxi operators may neither make individual seats available to their passengers rather than the vehicle in its entirety, or predetermine their destination. It also considers the practices at issue to constitute touting for custom within the meaning of Article 31, point 7, of the Decree of the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region of 29 March 2007 on taxi services and private hire vehicle services, as amended by the Decree of the Government of the Brussels-Capital Region of 27 March 2014. It is of the opinion that those practices constitute infringements of those provisions and acts contrary to honest market practice. Therefore, in its view, those practices are prohibited and may, on application by an interested party, be the subject of an order preventing their continuation.</p>

            <p>Specifically, it raises the issue of whether, in order for Article 96(1) TFEU to be found applicable to the case pending before it, in so far as that provision covers `transport operations carried out within the Union', the transport operation concerned must have a transnational dimension. It states that, given that the train station and airport concerned have an international dimension, the transport services at issue before it are not provided solely to Belgian nationals. It also raises the issue of the interpretation of the words `rates and conditions' in that provision together with that of whether the protection of particular industries allowed under it applies to a transport industry, such as one offering a taxi service.</p>
