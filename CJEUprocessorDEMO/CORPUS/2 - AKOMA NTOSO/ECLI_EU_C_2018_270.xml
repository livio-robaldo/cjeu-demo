            <p>On 24 June and 22 October 2014, PT Comunicações SA, the predecessor in law of MEO, lodged a complaint with the competition authority alleging that GDA had abused its dominant position. It claimed that that abuse arose from the fact that GDA had been charging excessive prices for the rights related to copyright and that GDA had also been applying to MEO different terms and conditions from those which it had applied to another entity providing the paid television signal service and television content, NOS Comunicações SA ( `NOS').</p>

            <p>The competition authority found that, between 2009 and 2013, GDA applied different tariffs to certain customers. However, that authority, relying, in particular, on the costs, income and profitability structures of the retail offerings of the television signal transmission service and television content, considered that that tariff differentiation had no restrictive effect on MEO's competitive position.</p>

            <p>According to that authority, in order to establish an infringement of subparagraph (c) of the second paragraph of Article 102 TFEU, any price discrimination must actually be capable of distorting competition on the market by putting one or more competing undertakings at a competitive disadvantage compared to the others. To interpret all discriminatory conduct on the part of an undertaking in a dominant position as entailing, in and of itself, an infringement of point (c) of the second paragraph of Article 102 TFEU would be inconsistent with the case-law of the Court.</p>

            <p>MEO brought an action before the Tribunal da Concorrência, Regulação e Supervisão (Competition, Regulation and Supervision Court, Portugal), the referring court, against the competition authority's decision of 3 March 2016 to take no further action, claiming that that decision is vitiated by an error of law, inasmuch as, rather than assessing the criterion of competitive disadvantage, as interpreted in the case-law of the Court, it examined whether there had been any significant and quantifiable distortion of competition. MEO claims that, in accordance with that case-law, the competition authority should have examined whether the conduct at issue was capable of distorting competition.</p>

          <content eId="para_10798__content">
            <p>The referring court indicates that the de facto monopoly on the relevant market enjoyed by GDA leads, in principle, to the conclusion that it has a dominant position. However, that court also states that there is evidence that the entities which provide a paid television signal transmission service and television content, nevertheless, have a considerable margin for negotiation vis-à-vis GDA.</p>

          <content eId="para_10799__content">
            <p>According to the referring court, the decision to take no further action of 3 March 2016 is based on the fact that the difference between the tariffs which GDA charged to MEO and NOS, respectively, was low compared to the average cost, so that that difference was not such as to undermine MEO's competitive position, as it was in a position to absorb the difference. That court indicates, in that respect, that MEO's share in the market for offerings of the paid television signal transmission service and television content increased during the period when GDA applied different tariffs to MEO and to NOS.</p>

            <p>In the main proceedings, MEO produced figures relating to the total and the average costs per consumer borne, respectively, by MEO and by NOS. MEO also produced figures concerning its profits and the profitability of its business during the period in question, that is to say, from 2010 to 2013.</p>

            <p>According to that court, it is clear from the case-law of the Court that certain discriminatory conduct toward trading partners may, by its very nature, bring about a competitive disadvantage. In addition, it follows from that case-law that, in the case of first degree discriminatory conduct, affecting direct competitors present on the same relevant market, it is sufficient to show that that conduct is capable of restricting competition. With regard to discrimination on the downstream market, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, it is likewise not necessary a priori to carry out a specific assessment of the effects on the competitive situation of the undertakings affected.</p>

            <p>In accordance with the case-law of the Court, the specific prohibition of discrimination under subparagraph (c) of the second paragraph of Article 102 TFEU is intended to ensure that competition is not distorted in the internal market. The commercial behaviour of the undertaking in a dominant position may not distort competition on an upstream or a downstream market, in other words, between suppliers or customers of that undertaking. Co-contractors of such undertakings must not be favoured or disfavoured in the area of the competition which they practise amongst themselves (judgment of 15 March 2007, British Airways v Commission, C‑95/04 P, EU:C:2007:166, paragraph 143). Thus, it is not necessary that the abusive conduct affects the competitive position of the dominant undertaking itself on the same market in which it operates, compared with its own potential competitors.</p>

            <p>In order for the conditions for applying subparagraph (c) of the second paragraph of Article 102 TFEU to be met, there must be a finding, not only that the behaviour of an undertaking in a dominant market position is discriminatory, but also that it tends to distort that competitive relationship, in other words, to hinder the competitive position of some of the business partners of that undertaking in relation to the others (judgment of 15 March 2007, British Airways v Commission, C‑95/04 P, EU:C:2007:166, paragraph 144 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In order to establish whether the price discrimination on the part of an undertaking in a dominant position vis-à-vis its trade partners tends to distort competition on the downstream market, as the Advocate General submitted, in essence, in paragraph 63 of his Opinion, the mere presence of an immediate disadvantage affecting operators who were charged more, compared with the tariffs applied to their competitors for an equivalent service, does not, however, mean that competition is distorted or is capable of being distorted.</p>

            <p>It is only if the behaviour of the undertaking in a dominant position tends, having regard to the whole of the circumstances of the case, to lead to a distortion of competition between those business partners that the discrimination between trade partners which are in a competitive relationship may be regarded as abusive. In such a situation, it cannot, however, be required in addition that proof be adduced of an actual, quantifiable deterioration in the competitive position of the business partners taken individually (judgment of 15 March 2007, British Airways v Commission, C‑95/04 P, EU:C:2007:166, paragraph 145).</p>

            <p>Therefore, as the Advocate General submitted in paragraph 86 of his Opinion, it is necessary to examine all the relevant circumstances in order to determine whether price discrimination produces or is capable of producing a competitive disadvantage, for the purposes of subparagraph (c) of the second paragraph of Article 102 TFEU.</p>

            <p>With regard to the issue whether, for the application of subparagraph (c) of the second paragraph of Article 102 TFEU, it is necessary to take into account the seriousness of a possible competitive disadvantage, it must be pointed out that fixing an appreciability ( de minimis) threshold for the purposes of determining whether there is an abuse of a dominant position is not justified (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 October 2015, Post Danmark, C‑23/14, EU:C:2015:651, paragraph 73).</p>

            <p>However, in order for it to be capable of creating a competitive disadvantage, the price discrimination referred to in subparagraph (c) of the second paragraph of Article 102 TFEU must affect the interests of the operator which was charged higher tariffs compared with its competitors.</p>

            <p>When it carries out the specific examination referred to in paragraph 28 above, the competition authority or the competent national court is required to take into account all the circumstances of the case submitted to it. It is open to such an authority or court to assess, in that context, the undertaking's dominant position, the negotiating power as regards the tariffs, the conditions and arrangements for charging those tariffs, their duration and their amount, and the possible existence of a strategy aiming to exclude from the downstream market one of its trade partners which is at least as efficient as its competitors (see, by analogy, judgment of 6 September 2017, Intel v Commission, C‑413/14 P, EU:C:2017:632, paragraph 139 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the present case, in the first place, with regard to the dominant position and the negotiating power relating to the charging of tariffs on the downstream market, it is clear from the file submitted to the Court that MEO and NOS are GDA's main clients. In that regard, the referring court states that there is evidence that they have a certain negotiating power vis-à-vis GDA.</p>

            <p>In addition, it is apparent from the information submitted to the Court, even though it is for the referring court to verify that that is indeed the case, that the determination of the prices by GDA is subject to legislation which requires the parties to have recourse to arbitration if they cannot reach agreement. In such a situation, GDA, as it did, in any event, at a given moment during the period at issue in the main proceedings in respect of the prices which it charged to MEO, merely applied the prices established by the arbitration decision.</p>

            <p>In the second place, with regard to the duration and the amount of the tariffs in question in the main proceedings, the referring court indicates, first, that the differentiated tariffs were applied between 2010 and 2013. Secondly, as regards the amounts which MEO paid annually to GDA, it is clear from the data set out in the competition authority's decision of 3 March 2016 to take no further action, the accuracy of which may be verified by the referring court, that those amounts represented a relatively low percentage of the total costs borne by MEO in its service for retail offerings for subscription television access and that the differentiation in tariffs had a limited effect on MEO's profits in that context. As the Advocate General stated in point 104 of his Opinion, where the effect of a tariff differentiation on the costs borne by the operator which considers itself to be wronged, or on the profitability and profits of that operator, is not significant, it may, in some circumstances, be deduced that that tariff differentiation is not capable of having any effect on the competitive position of that operator.</p>

            <p>In the third place, it must be pointed out that, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings where the application of differentiated tariffs concerns only the downstream market, the undertaking in a dominant position, in principle, has no interest in excluding one of its trade partners from the downstream market. In any event, the file submitted to the Court does not contain any indication that GDA pursued such an objective.</p>

            <p>It falls to the referring court to determine, in the light of all the foregoing considerations, whether the tariff in the main proceedings was capable of placing MEO at a competitive disadvantage.</p>

            <p>In view of the foregoing, the answer to the questions referred is that the concept of `competitive disadvantage', for the purposes of subparagraph (c) of the second paragraph of Article 102 TFEU, must be interpreted to the effect that, where a dominant undertaking applies discriminatory prices to trade partners on the downstream market, it covers a situation in which that behaviour is capable of distorting competition between those trade partners. A finding of such a `competitive disadvantage' does not require proof of actual quantifiable deterioration in the competitive situation, but must be based on an analysis of all the relevant circumstances of the case leading to the conclusion that that behaviour has an effect on the costs, profits or any other relevant interest of one or more of those partners, so that that conduct is such as to affect that situation.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules: The concept of `competitive disadvantage', for the purposes of subparagraph (c) of the second paragraph of Article 102 TFEU, must be interpreted to the effect that, where a dominant undertaking applies discriminatory prices to trade partners on the downstream market, it covers a situation in which that behaviour is capable of distorting competition between those trade partners.
