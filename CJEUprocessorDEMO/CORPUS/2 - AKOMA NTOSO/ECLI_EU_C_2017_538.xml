            <p>Article 11(1) of the Basic Regulation lays down the principle of a single applicable law, pursuant to which the persons to whom that law applies are subject to the legislation of a single Member State. Therefore, that principle also aims to avoid the complications which may arise from the simultaneous application of several national laws and to eliminate unequal treatment which, for employed and self-employed workers moving within the Union, is the consequence of partial or total overlapping of the applicable legislation (see, to that effect, judgment of 9 March 2006, Piatkowski, C‑493/04, EU:C:2006:167, paragraph 21).</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be noted that, according to the settled case-law of the Court, the procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU is an instrument for cooperation between the Court of Justice and the national courts, by means of which the Court provides the national courts with the points of interpretation of EU law which they need in order to decide the disputes before them (order of 20 July 2016, Stanleybet Malta and Stoppani, C‑141/16, not published, EU:C:2016:596, paragraph 6 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It is also clear from settled case-law that the need to provide an interpretation of EU law which will be of use to the national court makes it necessary for the national court to define the factual and legal context of the questions it is asking or, at the very least, to explain the factual circumstances on which those questions are based. The order for reference must also set out the precise reasons why the national court is unsure as to the interpretation of EU law and considers it necessary to refer a question to the Court for a preliminary ruling (order of 20 July 2016, Stanleybet Malta and Stoppani, C‑141/16, not published, EU:C:2016:596, paragraph 7 and the case-law cited).</p>

It is the Court's duty to ensure that that opportunity is safeguarded, given that, under that provision, only the orders for reference are notified to the interested parties (order of 20 July 2016, Stanleybet Malta and Stoppani, C‑141/16, not published, EU:C:2016:596, paragraph 10 and the case-law cited).</p>

Thus, the Court does not have any information on the reasons for which the interpretation of EU law requested is necessary to answer that question. In those circumstances, the Member States and other interested parties, within the meaning of Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, were unable, or only very briefly, to properly submit their observations on that question.</p>
