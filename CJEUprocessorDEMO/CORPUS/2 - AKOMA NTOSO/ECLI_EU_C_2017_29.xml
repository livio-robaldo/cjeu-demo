No free allocation shall be made in respect of any electricity production, except for cases falling within Article 10c and electricity produced from waste gases. For each sector and subsector, in principle, the benchmark shall be calculated for products rather than for inputs, in order to maximise greenhouse gas emissions reductions and energy efficiency savings throughout each production process of the sector or the subsector concerned. ... 2.

That measure, designed to amend non-essential elements of this Directive by supplementing it, shall be adopted in accordance with the regulatory procedure with scrutiny referred to in Article 23(3). 2.   The regulation referred to in paragraph 1 shall take into account the most accurate and up-to-date scientific evidence available, in particular from the [Intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC)], and may also specify requirements for operators to report on emissions associated with the production of goods produced by energy intensive industries which may be subject to international competition. That regulation may also specify requirements for this information to be verified independently. Those requirements may include reporting on levels of emissions from electricity generation covered by the Community scheme associated with the production of such goods. 3.   Member States shall ensure that each operator of an installation or an aircraft operator monitors and reports the emissions from that installation during each calendar year, or, from 1 January 2010, the aircraft which it operates, to the competent authority after the end of that year in accordance with the regulation referred to in paragraph 1. 4.

Consequently, an assessment, in the present case, of the validity of the provisions at issue from that regulation requires determination whether the Commission, by adopting those provisions, did not exceed the limits as provided for in Directive 2003/87.</p>

            <p>According to recital 5, Directive 2003/87 is intended to establish a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading capable of contributing to the fulfilment of the commitments of the European Union and of its Member States under the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, approved, on behalf of the European Community, by Council Decision 2002/358/EC of 25 April 2002 ( OJ 2002 L 130, p. 1), which seeks to reduce those emissions into the atmosphere to a level preventing dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system and the ultimate objective of which is to protect the environment.</p>

            <p>The economic logic underlying the greenhouse gas emission allowance, in accordance with Article 1 of Directive 2003/87, consists in ensuring that the reductions of greenhouse gas emissions required to achieve a predetermined environmental outcome take place at the lowest cost. By allowing, in particular, the allowances allocated to be sold, the scheme is intended to encourage a participant in the scheme to emit quantities of greenhouse gases less than the allowances originally allocated him, in order to sell the surplus to another participant who has emitted more than his allowance (see, inter alia, judgments of 16 December 2008, Arcelor Atlantique et Lorraine and Others, C‑127/07, EU:C:2008:728, paragraph 32, and of 7 April 2016, Holcim (Romania) v Commission, C‑556/14 P, not published, EU:C:2016:207, paragraphs 64 and 65).</p>

            <p>Thus, one of the pillars on which the scheme established by Directive 2003/87 is built is the obligation for operators to surrender by 30 April of the current year, in order to have them cancelled, a number of greenhouse gas emission allowances equal to their emissions during the preceding calendar year (judgment of 29 April 2015, Nordzucker, C‑148/14, EU:C:2015:287, paragraph 29).</p>

            <p>According to Article 3(b) of Directive 2003/87, `emissions' are, for the purposes of that directive, defined as the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere from sources in an installation.

            <p>Indeed, it should be noted in that regard that Article 12(3a) of Directive 2003/87 provides that, subject to certain conditions, emissions which have been captured and transported for their permanent geological storage to a facility for which a permit is in force in accordance with Directive 2009/31 are not subject to the allowance surrender obligations.</p>

            <p>Moreover, it does not appear, in the first place, that the guarantees taken as a whole arising, on the one hand, from the monitoring and reporting scheme provided for in Directive 2003/87 and from the provisions of Regulation No 601/2012 other than those at issue in the main proceedings, and arising, on the other, from the powers of review and verification conferred on the competent authorities of the Member States (see, to that effect, judgment of 29 April 2015, Nordzucker, C‑148/14, EU:C:2015:287, paragraph 37) would not be sufficient to avoid the risk of circumventing the emissions allowance scheme upon the transfer of greenhouse gases to an installation, such as that where the PCC is produced, not subject to that scheme.</p>

            <p>In the second place, since Regulation No 601/2012 was adopted on the basis of Article 14(1) of Directive 2003/87 in order to clarify the monitoring and reporting conditions of greenhouse gas emissions, the scope of the provisions of that regulation which are at issue in the present case, and concern only such emissions within the meaning of Article 3(b) of Directive 2003/87, cannot be affected by other provisions of that directive relating to the production of CO 2 and taken into account, inter alia, for the establishment of the `ex-ante benchmarks' referred to in Article 10a of the same directive.</p>

            <p>For the same reason, that scope cannot be affected by the requirement imposed on the Commission under Article 14(2) of Directive 2003/87 to take into account, in the drafting of Regulation No 601/2012, the most accurate and up-to-date scientific evidence available. In that regard, even supposing that the most up-to-date evidence from the IPCC had rightly prompted the Commission to adopt a stricter approach concerning transfers of CO 2 and, as a result and as far as possible, to attribute greenhouse gases to their source, such an attribution can, however, be accepted, in any event, only within the framework laid down by Directive 2003/87, as set out in paragraph 27 above.</p>

            <p>In the third place, it is undoubtedly the case that, although the principal objective of the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading is to reduce emissions of such gases substantially, one of its sub-objectives is to preserve the integrity of the internal market and of conditions of competition (see, to that effect, judgments of 29 March 2012, Commission v Estonia, C‑505/09 P, EU:C:2012:179, paragraph 79, and of 22 June 2016, DK Recycling und Roheisen v Commission, C‑540/14 P, EU:C:2016:469, paragraphs 49 and 50). However, as the Advocate General noted in point 49 of her Opinion, there is an objective difference between an operator who releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and an operator who avoids such emissions by chemically transforming the CO</p>

            <p>produced into a new, stable chemical in which it is bound. Consequently, although as far as the scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading is concerned such a difference allows the second operator to hold onto a greater allowance than the first, that difference cannot be regarded per se as distorting competition between those two operators.</p>

            <p>It follows from all the foregoing considerations that the Commission, having altered an essential element of Directive 2003/87 when it adopted the second sentence of Article 49(1) of Regulation No 601/2012 and point 10(B) of Annex IV to that regulation, overstepped the limits laid down in Article 14(1) of that directive.</p>
