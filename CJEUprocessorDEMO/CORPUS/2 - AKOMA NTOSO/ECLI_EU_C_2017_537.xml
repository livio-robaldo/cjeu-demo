            <p>It follows from the wording of Article 14(1)(c) of Directive 2003/96 that the exemption laid down by that provision is subject to the requirement that the energy products be used as fuel for the purposes of navigation within European Union waters (see, by analogy, judgments of 10 November 2011, Sea Fighter, C‑505/10, EU:C:2011:725, paragraph 20, and of 21 December 2011, Haltergemeinschaft, C‑250/10, not published, EU:C:2011:862, paragraph 21).</p>

            <p>Concerning the term `navigation', referred to in Article 14(1)(c) of Directive 2003/96, it is apparent from the case-law of the Court that all navigation activity for commercial purposes comes within the scope of the exemption laid down by that provision, regardless of the purpose of that navigation (see, to that effect, judgments of 1 April 2004, Deutsche See-Bestattungs-Genossenschaft, C‑389/02, EU:C:2004:214, paragraphs 23, 25 and 29; of 1 March 2007, Jan De Nul, C‑391/05, EU:C:2007:126, paragraph 36, and of 10 November 2011, Sea Fighter, C‑505/10, EU:C:2011:725, paragraph 16).</p>

            <p>Thus, the purpose of a ship's journey within European Union waters is irrelevant for the application of that exemption when that navigation involves the provision of a service for consideration (see, by analogy, judgments of 1 March 2007, Jan De Nul, C‑391/05, EU:C:2007:126, paragraph 37, and of 10 November 2011, Sea Fighter, C‑505/10, EU:C:2011:725, paragraph 17).</p>

          <content eId="para_12673__content">
            <p>In that regard, the Court has stated that the term `navigation' requires that the provision of a service for consideration be inherent in the ship's journey (see, to that effect, judgments of 1 March 2007, Jan De Nul, C‑391/05, EU:C:2007:126, paragraph 40, and of 10 November 2011, Sea Fighter, C‑505/10, EU:C:2011:725, paragraph 18).</p>

            <p>It is apparent from the expression `other than for the carriage of passengers or goods or for the supply of services for consideration', used in Article 14(1)(c), second paragraph, of Directive 2003/96, that the `navigation' covered by the exemption laid down in Article 14(1)(c) relates to uses where a boat is used directly for the supply of services for consideration (see, by analogy, judgment of 1 December 2011, Systeme Helmholz, C‑79/10, EU:C:2011:797, paragraph 21).</p>

            <p>In particular, the exemption laid down by Article 14(1)(c) of that directive is designed to facilitate trade within the European Union, particularly the movement of goods and the freedom to provide services capable of taking place within European Union waters. By that exemption, the EU legislature intended to promote the equality of certain tax conditions under which the transport undertakings or other services which ply those waters operate (see, by analogy, judgment of 1 March 2007, Jan De Nul, C‑391/05, EU:C:2007:126, paragraphs 24 and 25).</p>

            <p>As regards the dispute in the main proceedings, it must be observed, first, that the journey of the ship from the port of Klaipeda to that of Straslund constituted the first necessary and indispensable step of a navigation for commercial purposes, since the sole objective of that journey was to collect goods from the latter port to then be transported to the port of Santander and, without that journey, that service of transporting goods could not have been provided.</p>

            <p>Therefore, a voyage, such as that referred to in the preceding paragraph, must be regarded as constituting a navigation activity used directly for the supply of services for consideration, in the present case the service of transporting goods, so that the fuel used to enable the ship to make that journey was used for `navigation' within the meaning of Article 14(1)(c) of Directive 2003/96.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the answer to the first question is that Article 14(1)(c) of Directive 2003/96 must be interpreted as meaning that the exemption laid down by that provision applies to fuel used to sail a ship, without cargo, from a port of a Member State, in the present case that where that ship was built, to a port of another Member State in order to take on cargo to be transported to a port of a third Member State.</p>

            </tblock>
            <p>41 By its second question the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 14(1)(c) of Directive 2003/96 must be interpreted as precluding legislation of a Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which excludes the application of the exemption laid down by that provision on the ground that the supply of energy products for a ship was carried out without complying with the formal requirements laid down by that legislation, even though that supply is in accordance with all the conditions for application laid down by that provision.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be observed that, both the general scheme and the purpose of Directive 2003/96 are based on the principle that energy products are taxed in accordance with their actual use (judgment of 2 June 2016, ROZ-ŚWIT, C‑418/14, EU:C:2016:400, paragraph 33).</p>

            <p>That said, the Court has held that the unconditional nature of an obligation to grant an exemption cannot be affected at all by the degree of latitude afforded to Member States by introductory wording such as that contained in Article 14(1), according to which exemptions are granted by those States `under conditions which they shall lay down for the purpose of ensuring the correct and straightforward application of such exemptions and of preventing any evasion, avoidance or abuse' (judgment of 17 July 2008, Flughafen Köln/Bonn, C‑226/07, EU:C:2008:429, paragraph 31).</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the Court has also held that when exercising their power to lay down the conditions for the exemption from excise duty provided for in Article 14(1) of Directive 2003/96, the Member States must comply with the general principles of law which form part of the legal order of the European Union, including, inter alia, the principle of proportionality (judgment of 2 June 2016, Polihim-SS, C‑355/14, EU:C:2016:403, paragraph 59).</p>
