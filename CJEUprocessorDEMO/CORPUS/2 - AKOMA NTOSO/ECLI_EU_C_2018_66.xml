                    <p>Card-based payment transactions are generally carried out on the basis of two main business models, so-called ``three party payment card schemes '' (cardholder -- acquiring and issuing scheme -- merchant) and ``four party payment card schemes '' (cardholder -- issuing bank -- acquiring bank -- merchant). Many four party payment card schemes use an explicit interchange fee, which is mostly multilateral. To acknowledge the existence of implicit interchange fees and contribute to the creation of a level playing field, three party payment card schemes using payment service providers as issuers or acquirers should be considered as four party payment card schemes and should follow the same rules, whilst transparency and other measures related to business rules should apply to all providers. However, taking into account the specificities which exist for such three party schemes, it is appropriate to allow for a transitional period during which Member States may decide not to apply the rules concerning the interchange fee cap if such schemes have a very limited market share in the Member State concerned.</p>

                    <p>The issuing service is based on a contractual relationship between the issuer of the payment instrument and the payer, irrespective of whether the issuer is holding the funds on behalf of the payer. The issuer makes payment cards available to the payer, authorises transactions at terminals or their equivalent and may guarantee payment to the acquirer for transactions that are in conformity with the rules of the relevant scheme. Therefore, the mere distribution of payment cards or technical services, such as the mere processing and storage of data, does not constitute issuing....</p>

            <p>In support of its request, American Express argues that the analysis undertaken by the Advocate General in his Opinion is misconceived in that some relevant definitions to be found in both Regulation 2015/751 and in Directive 2015/2366 are not taken into account, although those two pieces of legislation, as is common ground between the parties in these proceeding, are complementary and form part of one legislative package. That analysis also reveals a misunderstanding of the scope of Article 5 of that regulation, in particular the scope of the concept of `intermediary' in that regulation. Further, as regards point 98 of the Opinion, either some wording is missing, or the reasoning set out there is contradictory. Last, the effect of the interpretation of that regulation as proposed by the Advocate General would be to extend the scope of that regulation much more significantly than any other interpretation advanced by the parties to the proceedings before the Court.</p>

            <p>It must first be borne in mind that it is solely for the national court hearing the case, which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine, with regard to the particular aspects of the case, both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it refers to the Court. Consequently, where the questions submitted concern the interpretation or the validity of a rule of EU law, the Court is in principle bound to give a ruling (judgment of 16 June 2015, Gauweiler and Others, C‑62/14, EU:C:2015:400, paragraph 24).</p>

            <p>It follows that questions relating to EU law enjoy a presumption of relevance. The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred for a preliminary ruling by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgment of 16 June 2015, Gauweiler and Others, C‑62/14, EU:C:2015:400, paragraph 25).</p>

            <p>As regards, first, whether there is a genuine dispute in the main proceedings, it must be observed that the action brought by American Express before the referring court seeks review of the legality of the `intention and/or obligation' of the national authority to apply or give effect to the provisions at issue. In that regard, it is apparent from the order for reference that the parties in the main proceedings hold opposing views on the substance of the action. Since the referring court has been called upon to resolve that disagreement and since it considers that there is a real point of contention between the parties in the main proceedings as to the interpretation and validity of the relevant provisions of that regulation, it is not obvious that the dispute in the main proceedings is not genuine (see, by analogy, judgments of 10 December 2002, British American Tobacco (Investments) and Imperial Tobacco, C‑491/01, EU:C:2002:741, paragraphs 36 and 38, and of 4 May 2016, Pillbox 38, C‑477/14, EU:C:2016:324, paragraph 17).</p>

          <content eId="para_18868__content">
            <p>Further, the arguments designed to establish that the dispute in the main proceedings is artificial, relying on the claim to that there is no act or omission on the part of a national authority the legality of which could be the subject of an action for review, are based on criticism of the admissibility of the action at issue in the main proceedings and of the findings of fact made by the referring court for the purpose of applying criteria laid down by national law. It is not, however, for the Court to call those findings into question since that falls, in the context of the present proceedings, within the jurisdiction of the national courts, or to determine whether the order for reference was made in accordance with the rules of national law governing the organisation of the courts and legal proceedings. Those arguments are therefore again not sufficient to rebut the presumption of relevance referred to in paragraph 32 of the present judgment (see, by analogy, judgment of 16 June 2015, Gauweiler and Others, C‑62/14, EU:C:2015:400, paragraph 26).</p>

            <p>Second, as regards the argument that the referring court has not set out either the relevant facts or the reasons why it is uncertain as to the interpretation and validity of the provisions at issue in the main proceedings, it must be observed that, in accordance with Article 94(a) of the Rules of Procedure, all requests for a preliminary ruling must contain `a summary of the subject matter of the dispute and the relevant findings of fact as determined by the referring court or tribunal, or, at least, an account of the facts on which the questions are based'.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it is sufficient that both the subject matter of the dispute in the main proceedings and the main issues raised for the EU legal order may be understood from the request for a preliminary ruling in order to enable the Member States and other interested parties to submit their observations in accordance with Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and to participate effectively in the proceedings before the Court (see judgment of 8 September 2009, Liga Portuguesa de Futebol Profissional and Bwin International, C‑42/07, EU:C:2009:519, paragraph 41 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In this case, it is apparent from the order for reference that Amex is a three party payment card scheme, within the meaning of Article 2(18) of Regulation 2015/751, and that it has entered into co-branding and service provision arrangements within the European Union. As a consequence of those arrangements, a large number of transactions carried out by it might, depending on the answers given by the Court to the questions referred for a preliminary ruling, fall within the scope of Regulation 2015/751, pursuant to Article 1(5) of that regulation.</p>

          <content eId="para_18872__content">
            <p>Accordingly, the order for reference sets out, briefly but precisely, the origin and nature of the dispute in the main proceedings, the resolution of which it regards as dependent on the interpretation and validity of those provisions. It follows that the referring court has adequately defined the factual and legal framework within which it has made its request for an interpretation of EU law so as to enable the Court to provide a useful reply to that request (see, by analogy, judgment of 7 July 2016, Genentech, C‑567/14, EU:C:2016:526, paragraph 27).</p>

            <p>As regards, further, whether the referring court has adequately set out the reasons why it is uncertain as to the interpretation and validity of the provisions at issue in the main proceedings, it does follow from the spirit of cooperation which must prevail in the operation of the preliminary reference procedure that it is essential that the national court sets out in its order for reference the precise reasons why it considers a reply to its questions concerning the interpretation or validity of certain provisions of EU law to be necessary to enable it to give judgment (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 May 2016, Pillbox 38, C‑477/14, EU:C:2016:324, paragraph 24 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It is therefore important that the national court should set out, in particular, the precise reasons that prompted it to enquire about the interpretation or validity of certain provisions of EU law and set out the grounds of invalidity which, consequently, appear to it capable of being upheld. That requirement is also stated in Article 94(c) of the Rules of Procedure (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 May 2016, Pillbox 38, C‑477/14, EU:C:2016:324, paragraph 25 and the case-law cited).</p>

Likewise, the referring court suggested that the Court might be required, depending on the interpretation of those provisions that it adopts, to give a ruling on the grounds of invalidity relied on by American Express.</p>

            <p>As regards, third, the argument that the bringing of the action in the main proceedings, seeking review of the legality of `intention and/or obligation' of the national authority to apply or give effect to Regulation 2015/751, is a means of circumventing the system of legal remedies provided for by the FEU Treaty and, more specifically, the Parliament's comment that, in this case, nothing has been done by the national authority that adversely affects Amex, it must be recalled that the Court has previously held to be admissible a number of requests for a preliminary ruling concerning the interpretation and/or validity of secondary legislation submitted in the context of such actions for review of legality, including the cases that gave rise to the judgments of 10 December 2002, British American Tobacco (Investments) and Imperial Tobacco ( C‑491/01, EU:C:2002:741); of 3 June 2008, Intertanko and Others ( C‑308/06, EU:C:2008:312); of 8 July 2010, Afton Chemical ( C‑343/09, EU:C:2010:419); of 4 May 2016, Pillbox 38 ( C‑477/14, EU:C:2016:324); and of 4 May 2016, Philip Morris Brands and Others ( C‑547/14, EU:C:2016:325).</p>

            <p>Moreover, the opportunity open to individuals to plead the invalidity of an EU act of general application before national courts is not conditional upon that act actually having been the subject of implementing measures adopted pursuant to national law.

That condition is fulfilled in the circumstances of the case in the main proceedings, as is apparent from paragraphs 21, 33, 34, 41 and 42 of the present judgment (see, by analogy, judgments of 10 December 2002, British American Tobacco (Investments) and Imperial Tobacco, C‑491/01, EU:C:2002:741, paragraph 40; of 16 June 2015, Gauweiler and Others, C‑62/14, EU:C:2015:400, paragraph 29; of 4 May 2016, Pillbox 38, C‑477/14, EU:C:2016:324, paragraph 19; and of 4 May 2016, Philip Morris Brands and Others, C‑547/14, EU:C:2016:325, paragraph 35).</p>

            <p>As is apparent from paragraph 37 of the present judgment, the answers given by the Court to the questions referred will determine to what extent three party payment card schemes, such as Amex, should be considered to be subject to the obligations stemming from Articles 3 to 5 and Article 7 of Regulation 2015/751, which require some action on the part of the Member States. In that regard, it must in particular be noted that, under Articles 13 and 14 of that regulation, the Member States are, on the one hand, to designate competent authorities that are empowered to ensure enforcement of the regulation and that are granted investigation and enforcement powers and, on the other, to lay down rules on penalties applicable to infringements of the regulation and to take all measures necessary to ensure that they are applied. It follows moreover from the order for reference that the national authority is in charge of Her Majesty's Treasury, which has ultimate responsibility for the fulfilment of the obligations imposed on the United Kingdom with respect to any form of application of Regulation 2015/751, in accordance with Articles 13 and 14 of that regulation.</p>

            <p>49 By its first question, the referring court seeks, in essence, to ascertain whether Article 1(5) of Regulation 2015/751 must be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of an arrangement between a co-branding partner or an agent, on the one hand, and a three party payment card scheme, on the other, it is a prerequisite of that scheme being regarded as issuing card-based payment instruments with a co-branding partner or through an agent and therefore being considered to be a four party payment card scheme, within the meaning of that provision, that the co-branding partner or agent act as an issuer, within the meaning of Article 2(2) of that regulation.</p>

            <p>It must first be observed that, under Article 1(3)(c) of Regulation 2015/751, Chapter II of that regulation, Articles 3 to 5 of which lay down rules on the capping of interchange fees for consumer card transactions, does not apply to `transactions with payment cards issued by three party payment card schemes'. Likewise, Article 1(4) of that regulation provides that Article 7 thereof, which requires the separation of payment card schemes and processing entities, does not apply to `three party payment card schemes'.</p>

            <p>However, Article 1(5) of Regulation 2015/751 provides, like Article 2(18) of that regulation, which defines the concept of a `three party payment card scheme', that, when such a scheme `licenses other payment service providers for the issuance of card-based payment instruments or the acquiring of card-based payment transactions, or both, or issues card-based payment instruments with a co-branding partner or through an agent, it is considered to be a four party payment card scheme'.</p>

            <p>It follows that, as a general rule, a three party payment card scheme is not subject to the obligations stemming from Articles 3 to 5 and Article 7 of Regulation 2015/751, unless it falls within one of the three situations described in Article 1(5) of that regulation, namely if it has licensed another payment service provider for the issuance and/or acquiring of card-based payment instruments (the first situation), if it has issued card-based payment instruments with a co-branding partner (the second situation), or if it has issued payment instruments through an agent (the third situation). In each of those three situations, a three party payment card scheme is to be considered, pursuant to Article 1(5), to be a four party payment card scheme.</p>

Recital 29 of that regulation adds, moreover, that `[t]he issuing service is based on a contractual relationship between the issuer of the payment instrument and the payer, irrespective of whether the issuer is holding the funds on behalf of the payer', that `[t]he issuer makes payment cards available to the payer, authorises transactions at terminals or their equivalent and may guarantee payment to the acquirer for transactions that are in conformity with the rules of the relevant scheme, and that, `[t]herefore, the mere distribution of payment cards or technical services, such as the mere processing and storage of data, does not constitute issuing'.</p>

The term `payment brand' is itself defined in Article 2(30) of that regulation as being `any material or digital name, term, sign, symbol or combination thereof, capable of denoting under which payment card scheme card-based payment transactions are carried out'.</p>

            <p>As regards the third situation provided for in Article 1(5) of Regulation 2015/751, namely the conclusion of an arrangement between a three party payment card scheme and an agent, it is true that that regulation does not define what is to be understood by the term `agent'. However, it is stated in recital 2 of Directive 2015/2366, which is also part of the EU legal framework on payment services, that the revised legal framework is complemented by Regulation 2015/751. It is apparent moreover from recital 6 of that directive that the intention of the EU legislature was that consistent application across the European Union of the legislative framework on payment services should be guaranteed.</p>

            <p>As observed by American Express, Article 4(38) of Directive 2015/2366 defines an `agent' as being `a natural or legal person who acts on behalf of a payment institution in providing payment services', while it should be noted that, under Article 4(3) of and Annex I to that directive, the issuing of payment instruments and/or the acquiring of payment transactions are to be classified as payment services.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, it cannot be inferred from the relevant definitions of the terms `co-branding' and `agent' that a co-branding partner or an agent that has entered into an arrangement with a three party payment card scheme necessarily acts within that scheme as an issuer, within the meaning of Article 2(2) of Regulation 2015/751.</p>

If, however, the EU legislature had wished to restrict the scope of Article 1(5), so that that would be the case, it could have made express provision to that effect (see, by analogy, judgment of 19 March 2009, Commission v Italy, C‑275/07, EU:C:2009:169, paragraph 99).</p>

In that regard, as is stated in paragraph 52 of the present judgment, Article 1(5) also covers, inter alia, the situation where a three party payment card scheme `licenses other payment service providers for the issuance of card-based payment instruments or the acquiring of card-based payment transactions'.</p>

It might, therefore, prove difficult to achieve the objectives of Regulation 2015/751, in particular that of Article 1(5) of that regulation, of ensuring a level playing field in the market, if situations where a co-branding partner or agent does not act as an issuer, within the meaning of Article 2(2) of that regulation, were, for that reason, to be exempted from the rules laid down in Articles 3 to 5 and Article 7 of Regulation 2015/751.</p>

            <p>As regards the duty to state reasons, it must be recalled that, in accordance with the Court's settled case-law, although the statement of reasons for an EU measure, which is required by Article 296(2) TFEU, must show clearly and unequivocally the reasoning of the author of the measure in question, so as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for the measure and to enable the Court to exercise its power of review, it is not required to go into every relevant point of fact and law. In addition, the question whether the duty to state reasons has been satisfied must be assessed with reference not only to the wording of the measure but also to its context and the whole body of legal rules governing the matter in question (judgment of 16 June 2015, Gauweiler and Others, C‑62/14, EU:C:2015:400, paragraph 70 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the Court has repeatedly held that if an act of general application discloses the essential objective pursued by the institution, it would be excessive to require a specific statement of reasons for the various technical choices made (judgment of 3 March 2016, Spain v Commission, C‑26/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:132, paragraph 31 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In this case, recital 28 of Regulation 2015/751 sets out with sufficient clarity the reasoning that underlies the decision that, in certain situations, three party payment card schemes should be treated in the same way as four party payment card schemes. As has been said in paragraph 68 of the present judgment, that recital states that it is to `acknowledge the existence of implicit interchange fees' and to `contribute to the creation of a level playing field' that three party payment card schemes are to be considered to be four party payment card schemes and to follow the same rules, while `transparency and other measures related to business rules should apply to all providers'.</p>

            <p>It follows, as stated, in essence, by the Advocate General in point 117 of his Opinion, that, by explaining the general situation that led to the partial classification of three payment card schemes as four party payment card schemes and the general objectives pursued by that classification, those provisions enable persons concerned to understand the reasons for that classification and the Court to exercise its power of review, in accordance with the case-law cited in paragraph 75 of the present judgment.</p>

            <p>It is stated in the order for reference that the validity of Article 1(5) and Article 2(18) of Regulation 2015/751 is disputed in the main proceedings on the ground that those provisions are vitiated by a manifest error of assessment. It is claimed that they provide that, within the framework of an arrangement between a co-branding partner or an agent, on the one hand, and a three party payment card scheme, on the other, it is not a condition of that scheme being considered to be a four party payment card scheme that that co-branding partner or that agent should be involved in the issuing activity of the three party payment card scheme.</p>

            <p>It must be recalled that, according to the Court's settled case-law, the principle of proportionality requires that acts of the EU institutions should be appropriate for attaining the legitimate objectives pursued by the legislation at issue and should not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives (judgment of 16 June 2015, Gauweiler and Others, C‑62/14, EU:C:2015:400, paragraph 67 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>With regard to judicial review of compliance with those conditions, the Court has accepted that in the exercise of the powers conferred on it the EU legislature must be allowed a broad discretion in areas in which its action involves political, economic and social choices and in which it is called upon to undertake complex assessments and evaluations. Thus, the criterion to be applied is not whether a measure adopted in such an area was the only or the best possible measure, since its legality can be affected only if the measure is manifestly inappropriate having regard to the objective which the competent institution is seeking to pursue (judgment of 8 June 2010, Vodafone and Others, C‑58/08, EU:C:2010:321, paragraph 52 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In this case, given that nothing has been submitted to the Court to suggest that Article 1(5) and Article 2(18) of Regulation 2015/751 are not appropriate for attaining the legitimate objectives pursued by that regulation, as described in paragraphs 67 to 69 of the present judgment, the Court must reject the argument that those provisions, in so far as they do not provide that the classification of a three party payment card scheme as a four party payment card scheme is conditional on the co-branding partner or the agent concerned acting as an issuer, are in breach of the principle of proportionality. In particular, since, as was stated in paragraph 71 of the present judgment, it is not inconceivable that some type of consideration or benefit might be identified in co-branding or agency contracts, even though the co-branding partner or agent is not necessarily involved in the issuing activity of the three party scheme concerned, it was not manifestly inappropriate, in the light of such objectives, to decide that such remuneration should also be subject to the interchange fee caps set by that regulation.</p>

Article 1(5) of Regulation (EU) 2015/751 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2015 on interchange fees for card-based payment transactions must be interpreted as meaning that, in the context of an arrangement between a co-branding partner or an agent, on the one hand, and a three party payment card scheme, on the other, it is not a prerequisite of that scheme being regarded as issuing card-based payment instruments with a co-branding partner or through an agent and therefore being considered to be a four party payment card scheme, within the meaning of Article 1(5) of Regulation 2015/751, that that co-branding partner or agent act as an issuer, within the meaning of Article 2(2) of that regulation. 2. Consideration of the second question referred for a preliminary ruling has disclosed nothing capable of affecting the validity of Article 1(5) and Article 2(18) of Regulation 2015/751.</p>
