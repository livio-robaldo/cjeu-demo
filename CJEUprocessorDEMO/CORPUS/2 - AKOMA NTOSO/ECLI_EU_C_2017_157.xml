It includes all the elements mentioned in the preceding article, together with a notice to the third party who receives it, informing him that he shall be liable, under conditions similar to those used in respect of bad faith, if he does not deliver the letter to the addressee as soon as possible. 2.   The letter may be delivered, after signature of the acknowledgment of receipt, to the addressee or to any other person at his place of residence or at his place of work and who declares that he is in a position to deliver it promptly to the addressee. 3.   Before the signature of the acknowledgment of receipt, the agent effecting the postal service shall verify the identity of the addressee of the service or of the third party to whom he is delivering the letter and note the information set out in the identity card or any other official identification document.'</p>

            <p>First, it is claimed, the acknowledgment of receipt of the registered letter was not included in the file, which constituted a breach of a formal requirement laid down by Portuguese legislation. Moreover, it is claimed, Mr Henderson did not personally accept service of the document instituting proceedings before the Tribunal de Comarca de Faro (Faro District Court) and did not know who had accepted the letter of service in question, so that he was not aware of the proceedings brought against him. Secondly, the standard form referred to in Annex II to Regulation No 1393/2007 was not transmitted to him. He was, therefore, not informed of his right to refuse to receive service of a judicial document drawn up solely in the Portuguese language, whereas, in the present case, a translation into English or Irish would have been required. In accordance with the case-law of the Supremo Tribunal de Justiça (Supreme Court, Portugal), such a defect rendered the service invalid. According to Mr Henderson, each of those two defects constituted not only infringement of a substantial procedural requirement but also a breach of his rights of defence. Only renewed service, in lawful form, would have compensated those shortcomings.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be borne in mind that Article 8(1) of Regulation No 1393/2007 expressly provides that the addressee of the document to be served may refuse to accept it, on the ground that the document in question is not drafted or accompanied by a translation in a language which he is deemed to understand.</p>

            <p>In that context, the Court has already decided that the right to refuse to accept the document to be served constitutes a right of the addressee of that document (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 September 2015, Alpha Bank Cyprus, C‑519/13, EU:C:2015:603, paragraph 49, and order of 28 April 2016, Alta Realitat, C‑384/14, EU:C:2016:316, paragraph 61).</p>

          <content eId="para_1920__content">
            <p>As the Court has already pointed out, the right to refuse to accept service of a document stems from the need to protect the rights of the defence of the addressee of that document, in accordance with the requirements of a fair hearing, enshrined in the second paragraph of Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and Article 6(1) of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed in Rome on 4 November 1950 (see, to that effect, order of 28 April 2016, Alta Realitat, C‑384/14, EU:C:2016:316, paragraph 73). While the main aim of Regulation No 1393/2007 is to improve the efficiency and speed of judicial procedures and to ensure the proper administration of justice, the Court has held that those objectives cannot be attained by undermining in any way the rights of the defence of the addressees of the documents in question (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 September 2015, Alpha Bank Cyprus, C‑519/13, EU:C:2015:603, paragraphs 30 and 31, and order of 28 April 2016, Alta Realitat, C‑384/14, EU:C:2016:316, paragraphs 48 and 49).</p>

            <p>It is important, therefore, not only to ensure that the addressee of a document actually receives the document in question, but also that he is able to know and understand effectively and completely the meaning and scope of the action brought against him abroad, so as to be able to effectively prepare his defence and assert his rights in the Member State of transmission (judgment of 16 September 2015, Alpha Bank Cyprus, C‑519/13, EU:C:2015:603, paragraph 32 and the case-law cited, and order of 28 April 2016, Alta Realitat, C‑384/14, EU:C:2016:316, paragraph 50).</p>

            <p>As regards the scope which must be given to that standard form, the Court has already held that Regulation No 1393/2007 does not contain any exceptions to its use (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 September 2015, Alpha Bank Cyprus, C‑519/13, EU:C:2015:603, paragraph 45, and order of 28 April 2016, Alta Realitat, C‑384/14, EU:C:2016:316, paragraph 59).</p>

            <p>From that consideration and the aim pursued by the standard form set out in Annex II to Regulation No 1393/2007, as described in paragraphs 53 and 54 of the present judgment, the Court has inferred that the receiving agency is required, in all circumstances and without it having a margin of discretion in that regard, to inform the addressee of a document of his right to refuse to accept that document, by using systematically for that purpose that standard form (judgment of 16 September 2015, Alpha Bank Cyprus, C‑519/13, EU:C:2015:603, paragraph 58, and order of 28 April 2016, Alta Realitat, C‑384/14, EU:C:2016:316, paragraph 68).</p>

            <p>Furthermore, where the receiving agency, which is required to serve the document concerned on its addressee residing in another Member State, has not enclosed the standard form in Annex II of Regulation No 1393/2007, that omission cannot render invalid either the document to be served or the procedure for service, as that consequence would be incompatible with the objective pursued by that regulation, which consists in providing a means of direct, rapid and effective transmission between Member States of documents in civil and commercial matters (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 September 2015, Alpha Bank Cyprus, C‑519/13, EU:C:2015:603, paragraphs 60 to 66).</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Tenth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Regulation (EC) No 1393/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 November 2007 on the service in the Member States of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters ( `service of documents'), and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 1348/2000, must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, according to which, in the event that a judicial document, served on a defendant residing in the territory of another Member State, has not been drafted or accompanied by a translation either in a language which that defendant understands, or in the official language of the requested Member State or, where there are several official languages in that Member State, in the official language or one of the official languages of the place where service is to be effected, the omission of the standard form set out in Annex II to that regulation renders such service invalid, even if such invalidity must be invoked by that defendant within a specified period or at the beginning of the proceedings and before any defence on the merits. The regulation requires, on the other hand, that such an omission be corrected in accordance with the provisions laid down in that regulation, by communicating the standard form set out in Annex II of that regulation to the person concerned. 2. Regulation No 1393/2007 must be interpreted as meaning that postal service of a document instituting proceedings is valid, even if:</p>

                <p>The acknowledgment of receipt of the registered letter containing the document to be served on the addressee has been replaced by another document, provided that such document provides equivalent guarantees as regards information provided and evidence. It is for the court hearing the matter in the Member State of transmission to satisfy itself that the addressee has received the document in question in such a way as to ensure that his rights of defence have been respected;</p>

                <p>The document to be served has not been delivered to its addressee in person, provided that it has been served on an adult person who is inside the habitual residence of that person and is either a member of his family or an employee in his service. Where appropriate, it is for the addressee to establish, by all admissible forms of evidence before the court hearing the matter in the Member State of transmission, that he could not effectively take account of the fact that judicial proceedings were being brought against him in another Member State, that he could not identify the subject-matter and grounds of the claim, or that he did not have sufficient time to prepare his defence.</p>
