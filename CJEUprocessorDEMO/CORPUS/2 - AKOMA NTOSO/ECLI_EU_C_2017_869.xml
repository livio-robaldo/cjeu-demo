After the works were completed, the building in question was registered on 31 July 2007 as a separate fixed asset in the fixed assets register, under the heading `show home', where it remained until the date of its sale to a third party on 15 January 2009.</p>

            <p>By decision of 30 July 2013, the latter upheld the decision of the Director of the Tax Inspection Authority. Agreeing with the latter, the Director considered that while, following the improvements made, the building in question had indeed been allocated, from an accounting perspective, for the company's own requirements with effect from 31 July 2007, that allocation had not however generated, since that date, any taxable activities. Consequently, first, the `first occupation' of the building in question, after the improvements made to it, had to be fixed not at 31 July 2007 but at 15 January 2009, that date corresponding to the date of the first taxable transaction to which the building in question had given rise since the improvements, namely its sale and, second, Kozuba could not claim the exemption provided for in Article 43(1)(10) of the Law on VAT, since that sale had been made in the context of the first occupation of the building in question.</p>

            <p>In its order for reference, that court states that the transposition of Article 135(1)(j) of the VAT Directive into Polish law gives rise to doubts as to whether the concept of `first occupation' as defined in Article 2(14) of the Law of VAT, and used in Article 43(1)(10) of that law, is consistent with the VAT Directive.</p>

            <p>In that regard, that court notes that it is necessary to establish whether the concept of `first occupation' of a building, within the meaning of Article 12(1) of the VAT Directive, must be understood to mean that the first occupation must take place in the context of a taxable transaction.</p>

            <p>That court also has doubts regarding the condition in Article 2(14) of the Law on VAT, according to which, in the event of the upgrade of a building, the exemption from VAT is only possible if the costs incurred by those improvement works amount to less than 30% of the initial value of the building in question. Thus, the Polish law assimilates any improvement of the building generating added value equal to or greater than the threshold for a conversion within the meaning of Article 12(2) of the VAT Directive to be capable of giving rise to a `new first occupation', which would justify a new liability for VAT.</p>

            <p>By its question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 12(1) and (2) and Article 135(1)(j), of the VAT Directive must be interpreted as precluding a national law, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, under which the exemption of supplies of buildings from VAT is subject to two conditions, namely that the supply is not made in the context of a first occupation arising in the course of a taxable transaction and that, in the case of the upgrade of an existing building, the costs incurred for that purpose are less than 30% of the initial value of that building.</p>

            <p>As the Advocate General observed in point 43 of his Opinion, the VAT Directive thus takes into account the professional and regular nature of the exercise of economic activities as general criteria for attributing persons the status of taxable person for VAT purposes. However those criteria are adapted in relation to immovable property transactions, since, in accordance with Article 12(1)(a), the VAT Directive allows Member States also to regard as a taxable person anyone who supplies, on an occasional basis, a building or part of a building and the land on which it stands, before its first occupation.</p>

            <p>Article 12(1)(a) of the VAT Directive refers to the supply of a building or a part of a building and the land on which its stand, made before its first occupation. Thus, those provisions, read together, make a distinction between old and new buildings, the sale of an old building not being, as a rule, subject to VAT (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 July 2012, J.J.

            <p>The ratio legis of those provisions is the relative lack of added value generated by the sale of an old building. Even though it raises the concept of `economic activity', within the meaning of Article 9 of the VAT Directive, the sale of a building following its first supply to a final consumer, which marks the end of the production process, does not generate any significant added value and must therefore, as a rule, be exempt (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 October 2001, Goed Wonen, C‑326/99, EU:C:2001:506, paragraph 52).</p>

            <p>Article 12(2) of the VAT Directive also confirms that it is the added value which determines whether the supply of a building is taxable for VAT purposes since it allows Member States to lay down the detailed rules for applying the criterion referred to in Article 12(1)(a), namely that of `first occupation', to the conversion of buildings. In that way, the VAT Directive makes it possible to tax supplies of buildings that have been converted, since a conversion adds value to the building concerned, in the same way as the initial construction does.</p>

Second, to the extent that it extended the criterion of `first occupation' to conversions of buildings, it fixed a quantitative criteria according to which the costs of such a conversion must reach a certain percentage of the initial value of the building concerned, namely, in the present case, at least 30% thereof, to lead to its sale being taxable for the purposes of VAT.</p>

            <p>The Court of Justice has consistently held that the need for a uniform application of EU law and the principle of equality require that the terms of a provision of EU law which makes no express reference to the law of the Member States for the purpose of determining its meaning and scope must normally be given an autonomous and uniform interpretation, which must take into account the context of that provision and the purpose of the legislation in question (see, to that effect, judgment of 13 October 2016, Mikołajczyk, C‑294/15, EU:C:2016:772, paragraph 44, and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It should also be observed at the outset that, according to settled case-law of the Court, the terms used to describe the exemptions envisaged by Article 135(1) of the VAT Directive are to be interpreted strictly since these constitute exceptions to the general principle that VAT is to be levied on all services supplied for consideration by a taxable person (see judgment of 19 November 2009, Don Bosco Onroerend Goed, C‑461/08, EU:C:2009:722, paragraph 25, and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, the interpretation of those terms must be consistent with the objectives pursued by those exemptions and comply with the requirements of the principle of fiscal neutrality inherent in the common system of VAT. Accordingly, that requirement of strict interpretation does not mean that the terms used to specify the exemptions referred to in that article must be construed in such a way as to deprive the exemptions of their intended effects (judgment of 19 November 2009, Don Bosco Onroerend Goed, C‑461/08, EU:C:2009:722, paragraph 25 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>As is clear from, first of all, the preparatory documents for the Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonization of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes -- Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment ( OJ 1977 L 145, p. 1), which remain relevant for the interpretation of the VAT Directive in the context of the exemptions laid down in Article 135(1)(j) thereof, the criterion of the `first occupation' of a building must be understood as corresponding to the first use of the property by its owner or tenant. The preparatory documents state that that criterion was included as determining the point in time when the product was likely to leave the production process and enter into the consumption sector. It does not follow from that historical analysis that the use of the building by its owner must take place in the context of a taxable transaction.</p>

            <p>Next, as regards the context of that provision, it should be noted that recital 7 of the VAT Directive states that the common system of VAT should, even if rates and exemptions are not fully harmonised, result in neutrality in competition, such that within the territory of each Member State, similar goods and services bear the same tax burden, whatever the length of the production and distribution chain. Furthermore, it is clear from recital 35 of that directive that a common list of exemptions is to be drawn up so that the European Union's own resources may be collected in a uniform manner in all the Member States.</p>

            <p>It follows that the principle of fiscal neutrality, which is the reflection by the European Union legislature, in matters relating to value added tax, of the principle of equal treatment (judgments of 10 April 2008, Marks &amp; Spencer, C‑309/06, EU:C:2008:211, paragraph 49, and of 14 June 2017, Compass Contract Services, C‑38/16, EU:C:2017:454, paragraph 21), precludes the system of tax exemptions, as transposed into national laws, from being applied differently in one Member State than in another.</p>

            <p>Finally, the VAT exemptions are intended to enable a comparable collection of the European Union's own resources in all the Member States. It follows that, even if Article 135(1)(j) of the VAT Directive, read in conjunction with Article 12 thereof (to which it refers), refers to the conditions for exemption fixed by the Member States, the exemptions laid down by that provision correspond to autonomous concepts of EU law so that the basis for assessing VAT may be determined in a uniform manner and according to common rules (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 October 2001, Goed Wonen, C‑326/99, EU:C:2001:506, paragraph 47, and the case-law cited).</p>

For new buildings, as the Advocate General observed in points 71 and 72 of his Opinion, that added value is the result of construction work that leads to a substantial modification of what physically exists as a result of the transition from immovable property without a building, or even undeveloped land, to a habitable building.

The same provisions must be interpreted as not precluding such a national law from making that exemption subject to the condition, in the case of the `upgrade' of an existing building, that the costs incurred have not exceeded 30% of the initial value thereof, provided that that concept of `upgrade' is interpreted in the same way as that of `conversion' in Article 12(2) of Directive 2006/112, namely as meaning that the building concerned must have been subject to substantial modifications intended to modify the use or alter considerably the conditions of occupation.</p>
