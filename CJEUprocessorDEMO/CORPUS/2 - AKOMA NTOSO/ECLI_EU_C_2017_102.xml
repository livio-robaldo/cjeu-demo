            <p>Under the 2001 Act, income tax payable by individuals in the Netherlands concerns not only income from work, but also income `from residence'. Where that residence is `owned', it is regarded as providing `advantages' that are calculated as a percentage of the value of the dwelling. Against those `advantages' can be set deductible expenses, including interest and costs arising from debts incurred in order to acquire the dwelling. If the amount of those expenses exceeds the value of the `advantages', the taxpayer is in a situation of `negative income'.</p>

            <p>The referring court is doubtful as to the scope of the case-law stemming from the judgment of 14 February 1995, Schumacker ( C‑279/93, EU:C:1995:31), given that, as opposed to the relevant facts of the case that gave rise to that judgment, X does not receive all or almost all his family income in a single Member State, other than that of his residence, which has the power to tax that income and which could, therefore, take account of his personal and family circumstances. X's situation is characterised by the fact that, when those circumstances were to be taken into account in calculating his income tax, he was resident in Spain, where he received no income, and he was receiving his income partly in the Netherlands, at 60%, and partly in Switzerland, at 40%.</p>

That is the situation in the main proceedings, since X had no income in Spain in the tax year at issue.</p>

Or does that obligation apply to only one of the States concerned in which work is carried out, and if so, to which?

What remains the decisive criterion is whether it is impossible for a Member State to take into account, for the calculation of tax, the personal and family circumstances of a taxpayer in the absence of sufficient taxable income, although such circumstances can otherwise be taken into account when there is sufficient income.</p>

Consequently, the concept of `Member State of activity', as it is envisaged in the present judgment, cannot be understood as other than a Member State that has the power to tax all or part of the income from the activity of a taxpayer, wherever the activity generating that income is actually performed.</p>

Were such reconciliation not to take place, the freedom of Member States to allocate the power to impose taxes among themselves would be liable to create inequality of treatment of the taxpayers concerned which, since that inequality would not be the result of disparities between the provisions of national tax law, would be incompatible with freedom of establishment (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 December 2013, Imfeld and Garcet, C‑303/12, EU:C:2013:822, paragraphs 70 and 77).</p>
