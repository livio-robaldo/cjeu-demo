            <p>The background to the dispute is set out as follows in the judgment under appeal: `1 The first applicant, Ms ... Azoulay, has a child registered since September 2014 at the Athénée (Belgian primary and secondary school) Ganenou in Brussels (Belgium). The other three applicants, Mr ... Boreham, Ms ... Bouchard and Mr ... Neville, have children registered at the International School Le Verseau in Bierges (Belgium). Until the school year 2014/2015, those of the applicants who already had children registered at those educational establishments before 2014 received reimbursement of those children's education costs within the limits of the monthly maximum amount.</p>

            <p>By their first ground of appeal, the appellants dispute paragraphs 31 to 36 and 38 of the judgment under appeal. They submit that the General Court erred in law in interpreting the concept of `education costs' in the light of circular No 4516 of 29 August 2013 of the Wallonia-Brussels Federation entitled `Free Compulsory Education', which is an information circular aimed at national authorities.</p>

          <content eId="para_12109__content">
            <p>According to the appellants, the concept of `education costs' under the Staff Regulations is an autonomous concept which must be interpreted taking into account the objectives pursued by the legislation of which it forms part and its context. The aim of the allowances is to take full account of an official's family situation, and in particular to pay him `additional' remuneration relating to the expenses that he must actually bear, irrespective of the system in which his child studies. In the present case, the costs paid by the appellants are intended to fund their children's education and are duly substantiated.</p>

          <content eId="para_12110__content">
            <p>As the General Court pointed out in paragraph 32 of the judgment under appeal, the appellants did not deny that non-payment of the costs at issue cannot lead to their children being excluded from a Belgian compulsory education establishment. However, children whose parents do not pay the costs of the specific educational programme could be excluded from that programme. They would, therefore, be obliged to follow national educational programmes, whereas the mother tongue of the appellants' children, like their cultural heritage, are different from those of the Belgian people.</p>

          <content eId="para_12111__content">
            <p>The appellants also submit that the General Court distorted the facts when it found, in paragraphs 31 and 36 of the judgment under appeal, that the invoicing of education costs by a non-profit association supported by the children's parents would not be consistent with national law, whereas the associations in question invoice not for the services which the school must provide free of charge, but rather for the educational services outside the compulsory Belgian curriculum. In other words, those specific contributions are used exclusively to finance the education which is not subsidised by the Wallonia-Brussels Federation and which is the distinctive feature of the school chosen and its educational project.</p>

          <content eId="para_12112__content">
            <p>Lastly, the appellants dispute paragraph 40 of the judgment under appeal, in which the General Court held that `as the contributions made to the non-profit associations concerned cannot be classified as education costs, they constitute costs arising from requirements and activities connected with following the curriculum, namely the participation of children in the specific programme and non-subsidised education provided by the schools in question, and must be regarded as ``other expenses connected with following the curriculum of the educational establishment attended '' for the purposes of the second paragraph of Article 3 of the GIPs, which, according to that provision, are not covered by education allowance B'.</p>

            <p>The wording of Article 3(1) of Annex VII to the Staff Regulations states clearly that the costs incurred must enable attendance at an establishment which charges fees.

            <p>Having regard to the autonomous nature of the concept of `education costs', the characterisation as that concept depends on the nature and constituent elements of the expenditure to be reimbursed (judgment of 8 September 2011, Bovagnet v Commission, F‑89/10, EU:F:2011:129, paragraph 22).</p>

            <p>Accordingly, the General Court did not err in law when it examined the nature and constituent elements of the costs relied on by the appellants, in order to determine whether they could be characterised as `registration and attendance fees at educational establishments' which charge fees.</p>

            <p>In that regard, the appellants do not deny that the International School Le Verseau and the Athénée Ganenou do not require registration and attendance fees. Such a factor is sufficient to preclude those schools from being education establishments which charge fees, for the purposes of Article 3(1) of Annex VII to the Staff Regulations, as specified in Article 3 of the GIPs. The General Court did not, therefore, err in law when it deduced from this, in paragraph 36 of the judgment under appeal, that the contributions requested by third bodies, such as non-profit associations, for the participation of children in the specific programme and non-subsidised education provided by those schools are not fees for registration and attendance at those schools and cannot be classified as `education costs' as referred to in Article 3(1) of Annex VII to the Staff Regulations and as specified in Article 3 of the GIPs.</p>

            <p>In the light of those factors, the General Court rightly held, in paragraph 40 of the judgment under appeal, that the contributions made to the non-profit associations concerned cannot be classified as `education costs'. Those contributions constitute costs arising from requirements and activities connected with the specific programme and non-subsidised education provided by the schools in question, and must be regarded as `other expenses connected with following the curriculum of the educational establishment attended' for the purposes of the second paragraph of Article 3 of the GIPs, which, according to that provision, are not covered by education allowance B.</p>

            <p>By their third ground of appeal, the appellants dispute paragraphs 47 and 48 of the judgment under appeal, by which the General Court held that their argument that a change in administrative practice is contrary to the principle of legal certainty was inadmissible on the ground that it was not raised in the complaint and does not, therefore, comply with the rule of correspondence between the prior administrative complaint and the action. The appellants submit that their argument was a response to reasons which had been put forward for the first time by the Parliament in the response to their complaint.</p>

            <p>According to the Parliament, the plea raised by the appellants in the complaint by which they relied on the change in administrative practice related to the infringement of the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations. The decisions of 17 and 19 November 2015, which responded to that plea, are based on settled case-law according to which the mere fact that an education allowance has been paid for several years is insufficient to enable staff to rely on that principle. The provisions governing the award of that allowance provide expressly that it is subject to an annual evaluation and therefore that it may be altered from one year to the next or even abolished. Consequently, the reminder of the annual nature of the evaluation of the education allowance is not a new ground, but an argument in response to the objections of the appellants who had information in that connection, so that it was possible for them to put forward a plea alleging the infringement of legal certainty in their complaint.</p>

            <p>By their fourth ground of appeal, the appellants dispute paragraph 56 of the judgment under appeal. They submit that the General Court infringed the obligation to state reasons in holding that the first part of the third plea in law, by which they relied on the fact that officials of other institutions had received reimbursement of education costs of their own children registered at the same schools as the appellants' children, was ineffective, but also in failing to adjudicate on the alleged infringement of Article 22 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, relied on nonetheless before the General Court. The appellants submit that, in accordance with Article 1a of the Staff Regulations, officials are entitled to equal treatment under those regulations, meaning that the regulations, as a general rule, must be given an autonomous and uniform interpretation throughout the European Union. However, the Parliament stated, in the decisions of 17 and 19 November 2015, that the fact that parents working at the European Commission still receive reimbursement for the education costs of their children registered at the International School Le Verseau and at the Athénée Ganenou related not to unequal treatment, but rather to the fact that `each institution has a power of self-organisation which enables it to use its margin of interpretation of the Staff Regulations autonomously'.</p>

Indeed, the principle of equal treatment must be reconciled with the principle of legality, according to which no person may rely, in support of his claim, on an unlawful act committed in favour of another (judgments of 4 July 1985, Williams v Court of Auditors, 134/84, EU:C:1985:297, paragraph 14; of 2 June 1994, de Compte v Parliament, C‑326/91 P, EU:C:1994:218, paragraphs 51 and 52; and of 1 July 2010, Časta v Commission, F‑40/09, EU:F:2010:74, paragraph 88).'</p>
