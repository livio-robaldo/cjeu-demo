            <p>The referring court states that German law distinguishes the first request for asylum, which is generally made at an authority other than the Office, from lodging a formal application for asylum at the Office. A third-country national requesting asylum is referred to a reception centre where he receives a certificate of registration as an asylum seeker. That centre must then inform the Office without delay of the fact that the person concerned has requested asylum. However, the authorities responsible for that information have often failed to fulfill that obligation, particularly in the second half of 2015, due to the unusual increase in the number of asylum seekers who entered Germany during that period. In that context, many asylum seekers have had to wait several months to lodge their formal applications for asylum, without being able to expedite that procedure.</p>

            <p>It is clear from the explanatory memorandum of the Commission proposal [COM(2001) 447 final] which led to the adoption of Regulation No 343/2003, first, that an asylum application must be considered to have actually been lodged as soon as the asylum seeker's intention has been confirmed with a competent authority and, second, that Article 4(2) of that regulation is the repetition of Article 2 of D ecision No 1/97 of 9 September 1997 of the Committee set up by Article 18 of the Dublin Convention of 15 June 1990, concerning provisions for the implementation of the Convention( OJ 1997 L 281, p. 1). Article 2(1) stated that an application for asylum is regarded as having been lodged `from the moment the authorities of the Member State concerned have something in writing to that effect: either a form submitted by the applicant or an official statement drawn up by the authorities'.</p>

            <p>In the third place, the effectiveness of certain important guarantees granted to applicants for international protection would be restricted if the receipt of a written document, such as that at issue in the case in the main proceedings, was not sufficient to demonstrate that an application for international protection had been lodged.</p>

            <p>To adopt such an interpretation would accordingly not only delay the implementation of measures intended to bring together an isolated minor and members of his family, but also extend the detention period of an applicant for international protection, in so far as the maximum detention period pending the submission of a take charge request is calculated, in accordance with Article 28(3) of the Dublin III Regulation, from the lodging of an application for international protection.</p>

            <p>In the fourth place, the Dublin III Regulation assigns a specific role to the first Member State in which an application for international protection is lodged. Thus, in accordance with Article 20(5) of that regulation, that Member State is, in principle, obliged to take back an applicant who is present in another Member State as long as the process of determining the Member State responsible has not been completed. Moreover, it follows from Article 3(2) of that regulation that where no Member State responsible can be designated on the basis of the criteria listed in that regulation, the first Member State in which the application for international protection was lodged shall be responsible for examining it.</p>

            <p>In order, in particular, to ensure the effective application of those provisions, Article 9(1) of the Eurodac Regulation provides that the fingerprints of every asylum seeker must, in principle, be transmitted to the Eurodac system no later than 72 hours after the lodging of the application for international protection, as defined by Article 20(2) of the Dublin III Regulation.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, to consider that a document such as that at issue in the case in the main proceedings does not constitute a `report', within the meaning of that provision, would, in practice, allow third-country nationals to leave the Member State in which they have requested international protection and to re-request that protection in another Member State, but they could not be transferred, for that reason, to the first Member State and it would not be possible to trace their initial request by using the Eurodac system. Such a situation could seriously affect the functioning of the Dublin system by calling into question the special status which the Dublin III Regulation grants to the first Member State in which an application for international protection is lodged.</p>

            <p>In the fifth place, to consider that a document such as that at issue in the main proceedings constitutes a `report', within the meaning of Article 20(2) of the Dublin III Regulation, is consistent with the objective of rapidly processing applications for international protection, referred to in recital 5 of that regulation, since such an interpretation ensures that the process of determining the Member State responsible begins as soon as possible, without having to be delayed as a result of accomplishing a formality which is not necessary for carrying out that process. In contrast, that objective would be weakened if the starting date for that process depended solely on a choice made by the competent authority, such as the grant of an appointment for a personal interview.</p>

            <p>In the light of the role of that provision in the system established by that regulation and its purpose, as emerge from the foregoing considerations, the transmission of the main information contained in such a document to the competent authority must be considered to be a transmission to that authority of the original or a copy of that document. Such transmission is therefore sufficient to establish that an application for international protection is deemed to have been lodged.</p>

            <p>The argument relied on by the German Government and United Kingdom Government and by the Commission, that account must be taken primarily of the distinction between `making' and `lodging' an application for international protection arising from Article 6 of the `Procedures' Directive, cannot call those conclusions into question.</p>

            <p>The Court notes, without needing to specify, in the present case, the scope of that distinction, first of all, that the examination of the terms used, in that respect, in the various measures falling within the Common European Asylum System does not appear to be conclusive. Indeed, Article 18(1) of the Dublin III Regulation refers, in several language versions, in an undifferentiated way, to lodging and making an application for international protection, whereas in other language versions, it refers exclusively either to lodging or making such an application. Similarly, Directive 2013/33 uses those terms in a variable manner in the various language versions of Article 6(1), Article 14(2) and Article 17(1).</p>

            <p>Next, although Article 6(4) of the Procedures Directive and Article 20(2) of the Dublin III Regulation show considerable similarities, the fact remains that those provisions differ, in particular in that the first of them envisages the taking into account of a document prepared by the authorities only if it is provided for by national law. Furthermore, Article 6(4) of the Procedures Directive is an exception to the rule laid down in Article 6(3) of that directive, since that rule has no equivalent in the Dublin III Regulation.</p>

            <p>Finally, Article 6(4) of the Procedures Directive and Article 20(2) of the Dublin III Regulation are part of two different procedures, which have their own requirements and are subject, in particular, in terms of time limits, to distinct schemes, as provided for in Article 31(3) of the Procedures Directive.</p>

            <p>In the light of all of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the fifth question is that Article 20(2) of the Dublin III Regulation must be interpreted as meaning that an application for international protection is deemed to have been lodged if a written document, prepared by a public authority and certifying that a third-country national has requested international protection, has reached the authority responsible for implementing the obligations arising from that regulation, and as the case may be, if only the main information contained in such a document, but not that document or a copy thereof, has reached that authority.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person, read in the light of recital 19 thereof, must be interpreted as meaning that an applicant for international protection may rely, in the context of an action brought against a decision to transfer him, on the expiry of a period laid down in Article 21(1) of that regulation, even if the requested Member State is willing to take charge of that applicant. 2. Article 21(1) of Regulation No 604/2013 must be interpreted as meaning that a take charge request cannot validly be made more than three months after the application for international protection has been lodged, even if that request is made within two months of receipt of a Eurodac hit within the meaning of that article. 3. Article 20(2) of Regulation No 604/2013 must be interpreted as meaning that an application for international protection is deemed to have been lodged if a written document, prepared by a public authority and certifying that a third-country national has requested international protection, has reached the authority responsible for implementing the obligations arising from that regulation, and as the case may be, if only the main information contained in such a document, but not that document or a copy thereof, has reached that authority.</p>
