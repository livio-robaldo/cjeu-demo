            <p>In support of that action, the Association claims that Royal Decree 4/2014 creates a distortion of competition at EU level by imposing higher costs on the production of Iberian pig products in Spain. Thus, the Association maintains that that decree constitutes a quantitative restriction on exports that is incompatible with Article 35 TFEU in so far as competing producers established in other Member States are not required to bear the costs resulting from a measure such as that imposed by the Spanish Government.</p>

            <p>In addition, the Association maintains that the objective of improving the quality of products, which is specifically stated in Royal Decree 4/2014, cannot be achieved by the measures enacted under that decree since, first, it has not been proven that doubling the total minimum unobstructed floor area per animal will increase the quality of Iberian pig products, and, secondly, setting the minimum age for slaughter at 10 months, whereas pigs reach the optimum slaughter weight at approximately 8 months, will result in the marketing of products that are too heavy. There is no demand for such products on the market and it will not be possible to sell them for a higher price that is proportional to the greater weight.</p>

            <p>The referring court considers that Spanish producers of products bearing the designation `ibérico de cebo' are at a disadvantage compared to other EU producers on account of having to bear higher production costs. It also considers that EU producers will be deterred from exporting their products to Spain since their products are not derived from pigs reared in accordance with the conditions laid down by Royal Decree 4/2014 and therefore cannot obtain that designation. Nevertheless, it acknowledges that, under the third additional provision of that decree, the marketing of products originating from other Member States and bearing similar, comparable or identical designations is to be permitted in Spanish territory, even if they were not produced in accordance with the provisions of that decree, provided that they comply with the quality standards of those Member States.</p>

            <p>The referring court is also unsure as to whether Directive 2008/120 constitutes a valid legal basis for Royal Decree 4/2014, in so far as Article 12 of that directive permits the adoption of more stringent national measures only where they are intended to improve the protection of animals. However, the aim of that decree is not the protection of pigs, but rather the improvement of product quality. In any event, the referring court has doubts as to whether that decree is compatible with Article 12 of Directive 2008/120 in so far as that article only permits more stringent national measures that apply within the relevant territory.</p>

            <p>In that regard, first, it must be pointed out that it is solely for the national court, before which the dispute has been brought and which must assume responsibility for the judicial decision to be made, to determine, in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, both the necessity and the relevance of the questions that it submits to the Court (see judgment of 21 June 2016, New Valmar, C‑15/15, EU:C:2016:464, paragraph 23 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Secondly, it must be noted that any national measure that is capable of hindering, directly or indirectly, actually or potentially, trade within the European Union must be regarded as a measure having an effect equivalent to quantitative restrictions within the meaning of Article 34 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgments of 18 October 2012, Elenca, C‑385/10, EU:C:2012:634, paragraph 22 and the case-law cited), and of 6 October 2015, Capoda Import-Export, C‑354/14, EU:C:2015:658, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It is clear from the Court's settled case-law that that provision is intended to apply not only to the actual effects but also to the potential effects of legislation. It cannot be considered inapplicable simply because at the present time there are no actual cases with a connection to another Member State (judgment of 22 October 1998, Commission v France, C‑184/96, EU:C:1998:495, paragraph 17 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Accordingly, it must be held that the question whether Article 34 TFEU precludes national legislation such as Royal Decree 4/2014 is relevant to the resolution of the dispute in the main proceedings and should therefore be answered.</p>

            <p>In that regard, the Court has consistently held that national legislation that subjects goods from other Member States, where they are lawfully manufactured and marketed, to certain conditions in order to be able to use the generic designation commonly used for that product, and which thus in certain cases requires producers to use designations which are unknown to, or less highly regarded by, consumers, does not absolutely preclude the importation into the Member State concerned of products originating in other Member States. Nevertheless, it is likely to make their marketing more difficult and thus impede trade between Member States (judgment of 5 December 2000, Guimont, C‑448/98, EU:C:2000:663, paragraph 26 and the case-law cited).</p>

That provision, so interpreted, ensures that the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings does not constitute an obstacle to trade between States (see, a contrario, judgment of 22 October 1998, Commission v France, C‑184/96, EU:C:1998:495).</p>

              <p>The second question</p>
            </tblock>
            <p>32 By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 3(1)(a) of Directive 2008/120, read in conjunction with Article 12 of that directive, precludes national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, providing that the use of certain sales designations for Iberian pig products processed or marketed in Spain is subject to producers complying with conditions for the rearing of Iberian pigs that are more stringent than those laid down in Article 3(1)(a) as well as a condition imposing a minimum slaughter age of 10 months.</p>

          <num>33</num>
          <content eId="para_14053__content">
            <p>In answering that question, the Court points out that the objective of Directive 2008/120, as stated in Article 1 thereof, is to establish minimum standards for the protection of pigs confined for rearing and fattening. According to recital 7 of that directive, those standards are intended to guarantee the protection of pigs kept for rearing and fattening in order to ensure rational development of production. To that end, as stated in recital 8, the directive provides for various rules intended, inter alia, to ensure that pigs have an environment corresponding to their needs for exercise and investigatory behaviour.</p>

            <p>However, it should be noted that the objective of the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings is not the protection of pigs, but rather the improvement of the quality of the products. Consequently, Royal Decree 4/2014 does not fall within the scope of Directive 2008/120.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, by increasing both the minimum unobstructed floor area available to each animal and the minimum slaughter age, that legislation is not liable to compromise the welfare of the animals and is therefore not incompatible with that directive.</p>
