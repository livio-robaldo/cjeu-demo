                <p>Is the second paragraph of Article 176 of the VAT Directive to be interpreted as precluding compulsory removal from the VAT register, based on an amendment to the ZDDS, which entered into force on 1 January 2007, where, at the time of compulsory removal from the VAT register, the taxable person meets the conditions for compulsory re-registration in that register, the taxable person is party to current contracts and states that it has not ceased business and continues to carry on an economic activity, if that taxable person must actually pay the tax calculated and payable upon the compulsory registration in order to be entitled to deduct VAT input tax on available assets taxed upon removal from the register and available at the time of re-registration? If compulsory removal from the register under the circumstances set out is permissible, may entitlement to deduct input tax on assets taxed upon removal from the register, which are available on the re-registration in the VAT register, and with which the person effects or will effect taxable transactions, be made dependent on the actual payment of the tax to the exchequer or may the tax calculated upon removal from the register be set off against the amount of tax credit determined on re-registration for VAT for the purposes of the ZDDS, particularly as the tax is payable by a person in respect of whom entitlement to deduct input tax arises?'</p>

            <p>The questions referred relate to national legislation which requires compulsory removal from the VAT register of a company whose dissolution has been ordered by a court decision and which amends the law in force on the date of the accession of the Member State concerned to the European Union, by providing that that removal and the obligations to which that removal gives rise to calculate the input VAT due or paid on the available assets and to pay that input VAT to the State may no longer be deferred, by the company's liquidator, until the date of that company's removal from the companies register.</p>

            <p>The referring court asks whether that amendment introduces a restriction on the right to deduct which did not exist on the date of accession of the Member State concerned to the European Union and which is, therefore, contrary to the second paragraph of Article 176 of the VAT Directive.</p>

          <content eId="para_3366__content">
            <p>According to that provision, which provides for a derogation from the rules relating to the right to deduct VAT, Member States which acceded to the European Union after 1 January 1979 may retain all the exclusions on the right to deduct provided for under their national laws on the date of their accession to the European Union.</p>

          <content eId="para_3367__content">
            <p>However, in the present case, there is nothing to show that the national legislation -- which, it is not disputed, relates to removal from the VAT register in the event of dissolution of a legal person, whether or not by reason of liquidation -- introduces an exclusion covered by that derogation.</p>

            <p>Consequently, in order to determine whether a measure, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, introduces a restriction on the right to deduct which is contrary to the VAT Directive, it is necessary to examine it in the light of the mechanism of the right to deduct set up by that directive, in particular in Article 168 thereof.</p>

            <p>Thus, by its questions, which should be examined together, the referring court asks in essence whether the VAT Directive, in particular Article 168 thereof, precludes national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, pursuant to which compulsory removal from the VAT register of a company whose dissolution has been ordered by a court decision results, even where the dissolved company remains party to contracts in force and states that it has not ceased its activity during the period of its liquidation, in the obligation to calculate the input VAT due or paid on available assets on the date of that dissolution and to pay it to the State and which, therefore, makes the right to deduct subject to compliance with that obligation.</p>

            <p>In order to answer the questions put by the referring court, it should be recalled that, according to the case-law, the existence of an economic activity establishes, pursuant to Article 9(1) of the VAT Directive, the status of `taxable person', to whom that directive gives the right to deduct (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 March 2005, Fini H, Câ€‘32/03, EU:C:2005:128, paragraph 19).</p>

            <p>It follows from Article 168 of the VAT Directive that, in so far as the taxable person, acting as such at the time when he acquires goods or receives services, uses those goods or services for the purposes of his taxed transactions, he is entitled to deduct the VAT paid or payable in respect of those goods or services (judgment of 14 September 2017, Iberdrola Inmobiliaria Real Estate Investments, Câ€‘132/16, EU:C:2017:683, paragraph 27).</p>

            <p>When a company ceases to carry out a taxable economic activity, except in the cases of transfer to a company of a totality of assets or part thereof referred to in Article 19 of the VAT Directive, that directive provides expressly in Article 18(c) thereof that the retention of goods by a taxable person or by his successors may be treated as a supply of goods for consideration, where those goods have given rise to a deduction.</p>

          <content eId="para_3376__content">
            <p>The Court has made clear that Article 18(c) concerns the cessation of the taxable economic activity in general, without differentiating between the causes or the circumstances of that cessation, apart from the exception mentioned in the preceding paragraph, and that that provision consequently also covers the cessation of the taxable economic activity resulting from the removal of the taxable person from the VAT register (judgment of 8 May 2013, Marinov, Câ€‘142/12, EU:C:2013:292, paragraphs 26 and 28).</p>

          <content eId="para_3377__content">
            <p>The Court has pointed out that the main objective of that Article 18(c) is to avoid a situation where the final consumption of goods on which the VAT became deductible is untaxed following the cessation of the taxable economic activity, regardless of the causes or circumstances of that cessation (judgment of 8 May 2013, Marinov, Câ€‘142/12, EU:C:2013:292, paragraph 27).</p>

            <p>Those considerations consequently apply to a cessation of economic activity resulting from a court decision and leading to the compulsory removal from the VAT register of the company concerned. In accordance with Article 18(c) of the VAT Directive, the Member States may consider, in that situation, that the taxable person carries out a supply to himself resulting in the obligation the calculate the input VAT due or paid and to pay it to the State.</p>

            <p>As is clear from the actual wording of Article 18(c) of the VAT Directive and from the objective pursued by that provision, that analysis applies however only in the situation where the taxable economic activity of the person concerned has ceased and where that person no longer carries out taxable transactions.</p>

            <p>In the present case, the referring court states that the main proceedings concern a company which has been dissolved and placed under liquidation, which, however, continues to effect certain economic transactions and generates a substantial turnover; this requires it, according to national law, to apply for its re-registration in the VAT register.</p>

            <p>In that context, the obligation to calculate the VAT due on the assets of that company available on the date of its dissolution and to pay that tax to the State in order to be eligible for deduction of the tax calculated is not justified by the intention to avoid untaxed final consumption.</p>

            <p>The Court has previously held that the question whether the VAT on an earlier or later sale of the goods concerned has or has not been paid to the public purse is irrelevant to the right of the taxable person to deduct input VAT (judgment of 12 January 2006, Optigen and Others, Câ€‘354/03, Câ€‘355/03 and Câ€‘484/03, EU:C:2006:16, paragraph 54). As the Direktor claimed, requiring the company concerned to actually pay the VAT due constitutes, for that company, an obstacle to deduction of the input VAT, since it requires that company to commit funds and obliges the tax authorities to return those funds when it re-registers, whereas other traders who hold assets may use them for their economic activities without being required to make such payment.</p>

            <p>Moreover, it is apparent from paragraphs 30, 31 and 35 of the judgment of 3 March 2005, Fini H ( Câ€‘32/03, EU:C:2005:128) that, as regards expenditure, such as rental expenditure, relating to a service used for a commercial activity carried out by a legal person which has ceased its activity and is in liquidation, the right to deduct the VAT payable on that expenditure must be recognised provided that that expenditure is directly and immediately linked to that activity, to the extent that the absence of any fraudulent or abusive intent has been established.</p>

            <p>Consequently, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, in which the company has been the subject of a court decision ordering the cessation of the activity for which it had been created, but in which it is not disputed that that company continued, whilst being placed under liquidation, to generate a turnover by carrying out economic transactions, that company must be considered to have the status of a taxable person and, consequently, it cannot be required, in order to be able to deduct the VAT calculated on its available assets, to pay the amount of VAT thus calculated.</p>
