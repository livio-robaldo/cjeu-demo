            <p>Thereafter, in the course of 2014, the Council established, within the framework of the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), a set of restrictive measures in response to the actions of the Russian Federation that were regarded as destabilising the situation in Ukraine. In view of the gravity of the situation in Ukraine notwithstanding the adoption, in March 2014, of travel restrictions and a freeze on the assets of certain natural and legal persons, the Council adopted, on 31 July 2014, Decision 2014/512, which was subsequently amended in September and December of 2014, in order to introduce targeted restrictive measures concerning the areas of access to capital markets, defence, dual‑use goods, and sensitive technologies, including in the energy sector.</p>

To that end, Decision 2014/512 established, in particular, prohibitions on the export of certain sensitive products and technologies to the oil sector in Russia and restrictions on the access of certain operators in that sector to the European capital market.</p>

            <p>Rosneft is a company incorporated in Russia, specialising in the oil and gas sectors. According to the information provided by the referring court, 69.5% of the capital of that company is owned by OJSC Rosneftegaz, a body owned by the Russian State. A minority shareholding in Rosneft (19.75%) is owned by BP Russian Investments Ltd., a subsidiary of the British oil company BP plc.. The remaining 10.75% of Rosneft's issued share capital is publicly traded. According to the order for reference, the activities of Rosneft and its group companies include hydrocarbon exploration and production, upstream offshore projects, hydrocarbon refining and crude oil, gas and product marketing in Russia and abroad. Its exploration activities include operations in waters deeper than 150 metres, in the Arctic, and in shale formations.</p>

On 9 October 2014 Rosneft brought an action, currently pending, before the General Court of the European Union, seeking the annulment of the contested acts. Subsequently, on 20 November 2014 Rosneft brought an application for judicial review before the High Court of Justice (England &amp; Wales), Queen's Bench Division (Divisional Court). In the context of the latter proceedings, Rosneft claims that both the restrictive measures adopted by the Council and the national measures to implement them are invalid.</p>

            <p>In support of that request, Rosneft argues, first, that the analysis carried out in this case by the Advocate General, in his Opinion of 31 May 2016, is in error with respect to the obligation incumbent on the Council to state reasons for the adoption of the restrictive measures at issue. That analysis also reveals a misunderstanding of the differences that exist between those restrictive measures and those adopted by the European Union in relation to the Iranian nuclear programme and it is therefore necessary that the Court seek further information on that subject. Further, the Advocate General's analysis of the concept of `legislative acts', within the meaning of Article 31 TEU, differs in its approach from that recommended in the Opinion of Advocate General Wahl in the case that gave rise to the judgment of 19 July 2016, H v Council and Commission ( C‑455/14 P, EU:C:2016:212), delivered after the date of the oral hearing in the present case.

            <p>In that regard, it must be borne in mind that when a question on the validity of a measure adopted by the institutions of the European Union is raised before a national court or tribunal, it is for that court or tribunal to decide whether a preliminary ruling on the matter is necessary to enable it to give judgment and consequently whether it should ask the Court to rule on that question. Consequently, where the questions referred by the national court or tribunal concern the validity of a provision of EU law, the Court is, as a general rule, obliged to give a ruling (judgment of 3 June 2008, Intertanko and Others, C‑308/06, EU:C:2008:312, paragraph 31 and the case-law cited).</p>

However, if the Court is to have jurisdiction in such a situation, it is necessary, first, that the applicant in the main proceedings who brings an action before the national court satisfies the conditions laid down in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU and, second, that the aim of the proceedings is to examine the legality of restrictive measures against natural or legal persons.

            <p>As a preliminary point, while, pursuant to the last sentence of the second subparagraph of Article 24(1) TEU and the first paragraph of Article 275 TFEU, the Court does not, as a general rule, have jurisdiction with respect to the provisions relating to the CFSP and the acts adopted on the basis of those provisions (see judgment of 19 July 2016, H v Council and Commission, C‑455/14 P, EU:C:2016:569, paragraph 39), it must however be recalled that the Treaties explicitly establish two exceptions to that rule. First, both the last sentence of the second subparagraph of Article 24(1) TEU and the second paragraph of Article 275 TFEU provide that the Court has jurisdiction to monitor compliance with Article 40 TEU. Second, the last sentence of the second subparagraph of Article 24(1) TEU confers on the Court jurisdiction to review the legality of certain decisions referred to in the second paragraph of Article 275 TFEU. The latter provision confers on the Court jurisdiction to give rulings on actions, brought subject to the conditions laid down in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, concerning the review of the legality of Council decisions, adopted on the basis of provisions relating to the CFSP, which provide for restrictive measures against natural or legal persons.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, the view can be taken that Question 1 encompasses, in essence, two issues. First, the question seeks to determine whether the Court has jurisdiction to monitor, pursuant to a request for a preliminary ruling submitted by a national court or tribunal under Article 267 TFEU, compliance, by the Council, with Article 40 TEU when the Council adopted Decision 2014/512. Second, the aim of the question is to ascertain whether the Court has jurisdiction to review the legality of restrictive measures against natural or legal persons, the adoption of those measures being prescribed by that decision, not only where those persons bring an action for the annulment of those measures before the Courts of the European Union, under Articles 256 and 263 TFEU, but also in circumstances where the Court is seised, under the preliminary ruling procedure provided for in Article 267 TFEU, of a request by a national court or tribunal which has doubts as to the validity of such measures.</p>

            <p>In that regard, with respect, in the first place, to the jurisdiction of the Court to monitor compliance with Article 40 TEU, it must be observed that the Treaties do not make provision for any particular means by which such judicial monitoring is to be carried out. That being the case, that monitoring falls within the scope of the general jurisdiction that Article 19 TEU confers on the Court to ensure that in the interpretation and application of the Treaties the law is observed. In establishing this general jurisdiction, Article 19(3)(b) TEU states, further, that the Court is to give preliminary rulings, at the request of national courts or tribunals, on, inter alia, the validity of acts adopted by the institutions of the European Union.</p>

In that regard, the last sentence of the second subparagraph of Article 24(1) TEU refers to the second paragraph of Article 275 TFEU in order to determine not the type of procedure under which the Court may review the legality of certain decisions, but rather the type of decisions whose legality may be reviewed by the Court, within any procedure that has as its aim such a review of legality.</p>

Having regard to the fact that the Member States must ensure that their national policies conform to the Union position enshrined in Council decisions, adopted under Article 29 TEU, access to judicial review of those decisions is indispensable where those decisions prescribe the adoption of restrictive measures against natural or legal persons.</p>

It must be recalled that the very existence of effective judicial review designed to ensure compliance with provisions of EU law is of the essence of the rule of law (see judgments of 18 December 2014, Abdida, C‑562/13, EU:C:2014:2453, paragraph 45, and of 6 October 2015, Schrems, C‑362/14, EU:C:2015:650, paragraph 95).</p>

The second ground is that those provisions are incompatible with the EU‑Russia Partnership Agreement. The third ground is that the Council, when it adopted those provisions, failed to respect the obligation to state reasons, the rights of the defence, the right to effective judicial protection and the right of access to the file. Rosneft's fourth ground is that there was a breach of the principle of equal treatment. The fifth and sixth grounds are respectively that the provisions at issue in the main proceedings are invalid because of the Council's misuse of powers and because the wording of Decision 2014/512 is contradicted by that of Regulation No 833/2014. The seventh ground is that the Council infringed the principle of proportionality and the fundamental rights on which Rosneft can rely, in particular its freedom to conduct business and its right to property.</p>

            <p>As regards acts adopted on the basis of a provision relating to the CFSP, it is the task of the Court to ensure, in particular, under the first clause of the second paragraph of Article 275 TFEU and under Article 40 TEU, that the implementation of that policy does not impinge upon the application of the procedures and the extent of the powers of the institutions laid down by the Treaties for the exercise of the Union's competences under the FEU Treaty (judgment of 14 June 2016, Parliament v Council, C‑263/14, EU:C:2016:435, paragraph 42).</p>

            <p>It is clear, in that regard, that the content of Decision 2014/512 is certainly detailed.

Taking account of the wide scope of the aims and objectives of the CFSP, as set out in Article 3(5) TEU and Article 21 TEU and in the specific provisions relating to the CFSP, in particular, in Articles 23 and 24 TEU, the Council has a broad discretion in determining such persons and entities.</p>

            <p>However, Article 215 TFEU, which serves as a bridge between the objectives of the EU Treaty in matters of the CFSP and the actions of the Union involving economic measures falling within the scope of the FEU Treaty (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 July 2012, Parliament v Council, C‑130/10, EU:C:2012:472, paragraph 59), permits the adoption of legislation by the Council, acting by a qualified majority on a joint proposal from the High Representative and the Commission, in order to give effect to restrictive measures where such measures fall within the scope of the FEU Treaty, and, in particular, to ensure their uniform application in all the Member States. With respect to Regulation No 833/2014, while it essentially reproduces the content of Decision 2014/512, it also contains definitions and clarification on the application of the restrictive measures prescribed by that decision.</p>

            <p>Having regard to the different functions of those two types of act, the one declaring the Union's position with respect to the restrictive measures to be adopted and the other constituting the instrument giving effect to those measures at Union level, the fact that a decision, adopted by the Council under Article 29 TEU, describes in detail the persons and entities that are to be subject to the restrictive measures cannot, as a general rule, be regarded as encroaching on the procedure, laid down in Article 215 TFEU, for the implementation of that decision. In particular, when the measures relate to a field where there is a degree of technicality, it may prove to be appropriate for the Council to use detailed wording when establishing restrictive measures. In such circumstances, the Council cannot be criticised for having predetermined, by the adoption of Decision 2014/512, part of the content of Regulation No 833/2014.</p>

            <p>As regards, further, Rosneft's argument that Decision 2014/512 does not comply with Article 40 TEU since that decision constitutes a `legislative act', within the meaning of Articles 24 and 31 TEU, which preclude the adoption of such acts in CFSP matters, that argument must also be rejected. Article 289(3) TFEU provides that legal acts adopted by legislative procedure constitute legislative acts. The exclusion of the right to adopt legislative acts in the area of the CFSP reflects the intention that that policy should be subject to specific rules and procedures, as is clear from Article 24 TEU. Since those rules and procedures, defined by, inter alia, the provisions relating to the CFSP within Title V, Chapter 2, of the EU Treaty, establish a specific division of tasks among the institutions of the Union in that field, it follows that the adoption of legislative acts, within the meaning of Article 289(3) TFEU, is, in that context, necessarily excluded.</p>

Similarly, the United Kingdom Government, the Estonian, French and Polish Governments, and the Commission dispute the argument that Decision 2014/512 contains restrictive measures against natural or legal persons, since, in their opinion, the measures contained in that decision apply to situations that are objectively determined and to a category of persons that is described in a general manner.</p>

In particular, the fact that few such entities are listed, due to the very limited number of operators present in the sector of the Russian energy market concerned that can be characterised as an oligopoly, does not alter the fact that the restrictions are based on objective criteria.

Notwithstanding the fact that such measures may also target, individually, other entities in a particular industry in a non-Member State, the fact remains that it follows from the nature of those measures, as described in paragraphs 102 and 103 of this judgment, that, if the legality of those measures is challenged, it must be possible for those measures to be subject, in accordance with the second paragraph of Article 275 TFEU, to judicial review.</p>

In that regard, it is not necessary for the reasoning to go into all the relevant facts and points of law, since the question whether the statement of reasons is sufficient must be assessed with regard not only to its wording but also to its context and to all the legal rules governing the matter in question and, in particular, in the light of the interest which the addressees of the measure may have in obtaining explanations. Consequently, the reasons given for a measure adversely affecting a person are sufficient if that measure was adopted in a context which was known to that person and which enables him to understand the scope of the measure concerning him (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 November 2012, Council v Bamba, C‑417/11 P, EU:C:2012:718, paragraphs 50, 53 and 54, and the case‑law cited).</p>

Further, it is apparent from recital 2 of Regulation No 833/2014 that the declared objective of the contested acts was to increase the costs of the actions of the Russian Federation designed to undermine Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence and to promote a peaceful settlement of the crisis.

In accordance with the objective of increasing the costs of the actions of the Russian Federation vis‑à‑vis Ukraine, Article 1(2)(b) of Decision 2014/512 establishes restrictions against certain oil sector entities controlled by the Russian State on the basis of, inter alia, their total assets, with an estimated value of 1000 billion Russian Roubles. Since both the political background at the time of the adoption of those measures and the importance of the oil sector for the Russian economy were also well known, the fact that the Council chose to adopt restrictive measures against the players in that industry can be readily understood in the light of the declared objective of those acts.</p>

            <p>In addition, Rosneft has argued before the referring court that there was an infringement of its right of access to the file and of its rights of defence and right to effective judicial protection. In that regard, it is clear from the written observations lodged with the Court that Rosneft submitted, to the Council, requests for access to documents, seeking, in particular, access to the file in order to be able to state its case in the action before the General Court for annulment of the restrictive measures at issue in the main proceedings. According to Rosneft, the Council was under an obligation to grant it access to all non‑confidential official documents concerning those measures on the basis of, inter alia, Regulation (EC) No 1049/2001 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents ( OJ 2001 L 145, p. 43) and the case-law stemming from paragraphs 59 and 60 of the judgment of 28 November 2013, Council v Fulmen and Mahmoudian ( C‑280/12 P, EU:C:2013:775), case-law which relates to respect for the rights of the defence, including the right of access to the file, subject to legitimate interests in maintaining confidentiality, and the right to effective judicial protection.

In that regard, the Court concurs with the United Kingdom Government and holds that, with respect to the restrictive measures at issue in the main proceedings which target the oil sector, it is open to the Council, inter alia, to impose, if the Council deems it appropriate, restrictions which target undertakings active in specific sectors of the Russian economy in which products, technologies or services imported from the European Union are particularly significant. The choice of targeting undertakings or sectors that are reliant on cutting‑edge technology or expertise mainly available within the European Union is consistent with the objective of ensuring the effectiveness of the restrictive measures at issue in the main proceedings and ensuring that the effect of those measures is not offset by the importation, into Russia, of substitute products, technologies or services from third countries.</p>

The Court has concluded that the legality of a measure adopted in those areas can be affected only if the measure is manifestly inappropriate having regard to the objective which the competent institution is seeking to pursue (judgment of 28 November 2013, Council v Manufacturing Support &amp; Procurement Kala Naft, C‑348/12 P, EU:C:2013:776, paragraph 120 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the main proceedings, it must be observed that the importance of the objectives pursued by the contested acts, namely the protection of Ukraine's territorial integrity, sovereignty and independence and the promotion of a peaceful settlement of the crisis in that country, the achievement of which, as is apparent from the factors mentioned in paragraphs 113 to 115 of the present judgment, is part of the wider objective of maintaining peace and international security, in accordance with the objectives of the Union's external action stated in Article 21 TEU, is such as to justify the possibility that, for certain operators, the consequences may be negative, even significantly so. In those circumstances, and having regard, inter alia, to the fact that the restrictive measures adopted by the Council in reaction to the crisis in Ukraine have become progressively more severe, interference with Rosneft's freedom to conduct a business and its right to property cannot be considered to be disproportionate.</p>

The United Kingdom Government considers that the question is hypothetical since Rosneft is not an EU exporter or service provider whose conduct is restricted by Regulation No 833/2014 and, consequently, Rosneft is not at risk of incurring any criminal penalty under the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings.

That condition is met where the individual concerned is in a position, on the basis of the wording of the relevant provision and, if necessary, with the help of the interpretation made by the courts, to know which acts or omissions will make him criminally liable (judgment of 3 May 2007, Advocaten voor de Wereld, C‑303/05, EU:C:2007:261, paragraph 50).</p>

It follows that, while the use of the legislative technique of referring to general categories, rather than to exhaustive lists, often leaves grey areas at the fringes of a definition, those doubts in relation to borderline cases are not sufficient, in themselves, to make a provision incompatible with Article 7 of that convention, provided that the provision proves to be sufficiently clear in the large majority of cases (see, to that effect, inter alia, ECtHR, 15 November 1996, Cantoni v.

            <p>Rosneft and the German Government consider that, in using that expression, Regulation No 833/2014 refers not to acts which involve the mere processing of payments, but to acts of financing which provide active and substantive support. In that regard, the German Government argues, in particular, that payment services are services supplied to carry out payments on behalf of third party payers, as is apparent from the definition given in Article 4(3) of Directive 2007/64/EC of the European Parliament and the Council of 13 November 2007 on payment services in the internal market, amending Directives 97/7/EC, 2002/65/EC, 2005/60/EC and 2006/48/EC and repealing Directive 97/5/EC ( OJ 2007 L 319, p. 1), read together with the annex to that directive. By contrast, services the supply of which requires authorisation under Article 4(3) of Regulation No 833/2014, such as the provision of grants, loans and export credit insurance, are services which the bank concerned provides using its own funds to the benefit of a third party.</p>

            <p>In the light of the foregoing, the answer to Question 3(a) is that the expression `financial assistance' in Article 4(3)(b) of Regulation No 833/2014 must be interpreted as meaning that it does not include the processing of a payment, as such, by a bank or other financial institution.</p>

            </tblock>
            <p>185 By Question 3(b), the referring court seeks, in essence, to ascertain whether Article 5(2) of Regulation No 833/2014 must be interpreted as meaning that it prohibits the issue, after 12 September 2014, of GDRs, pursuant to a depositary agreement concluded with one of the entities listed in Annex VI to that regulation, where those GDRs represent shares issued by one of those entities before 12 September 2014.</p>

            <p>Rosneft considers that this question should be answered in the negative. According to Rosneft, an interpretation to the effect that the holders of shares in the entities targeted by the restrictive measures at issue in the main proceedings could not re-package their shares as GDRs would be at odds with the objective pursued by Regulation No 833/2014, which is to apply pressure on the Russian Federation by restricting the capacity of the targeted entities to raise capital, in so far as that interpretation affects, in particular, the shareholders of those entities.</p>

            <p>It is stated in Article 5(2)(b) of Regulation No 833/2014, inter alia, that any transaction consisting in purchasing, selling, providing investment services or assistance in the issuance of certain transferable securities, issued after 12 September 2014, and any transaction consisting in dealing in such transferable securities, carried out by the entities listed in Annex VI to that regulation, one of those entities being Rosneft, is prohibited. In that regard, it must be noted that the expression `transferable securities' includes, in accordance with the definition in Article 1(f) of Regulation No 833/2014, depositary receipts in respect of shares.</p>

            <p>As regards Rosneft's argument that that prohibition is contrary to the objective of that regulation in that it penalises the holders of shares in the entities listed in Annex VI to that regulation, the Court must concur with the view of the FCA that restrictive measures, in so far as they affect a company, are inherently liable to have a negative effect on the interests of that company's shareholders. In this case, since the objective of those restrictive measures was precisely to increase the cost of the actions of the Russian Federation, which is Rosneft's majority shareholder, that argument is wholly unfounded.</p>

            <p>It may be added that it is plain that Article 5(2) of Regulation No 833/2014 prohibits the issuance, after 12 September 2014, of GDRs in respect of the shares of the entities listed in Annex VI to that regulation, irrespective of the date of issue of those shares.</p>

            <p>191 By Question 3(c), the referring court asks the Court to provide an interpretation, if considered necessary, of the concepts of `waters deeper than 150 metres' and `shale', in Articles 3 and 3a of Regulation No 833/2014.</p>

            <p>On reading the order for reference, it is apparent that the submission of this question complements the submission to the Court of Question 2(b), whereby the referring court seeks to ascertain whether Regulation No 833/2014 is invalid because of an alleged lack of clarity. The referring court does no more than state, in this regard, that it is open to the Court, if the Court considers it appropriate, to provide the parties to the proceedings with more detailed definitions of those concepts.</p>

            <p>In that regard, while it is true that questions referred for a preliminary ruling on EU law enjoy a presumption of relevance (judgment of 28 July 2011, Lidl &amp; Companhia, C‑106/10, EU:C:2011:526, paragraph 25 and the case-law cited), it must be emphasised that, in accordance with settled case-law, the justification for a reference for a preliminary ruling is not that it enables advisory opinions on general or hypothetical questions to be delivered but rather that it is necessary for the effective resolution of a dispute (judgment of 20 January 2005, García Blanco, C‑225/02, EU:C:2005:34, paragraph 28 and the case‑law cited).</p>

Since the answer given to Question 2(b) is that an examination of Articles 3 and 3a of Regulation No 833/2014, in the light of the principles of legal certainty and nulla poena sine lege certa, disclosed nothing capable of calling into question the validity of those provisions, it is not apparent, on the basis of the information in the order for reference, that the referring court needs, in addition, an interpretation of the abovementioned concepts in order to make a decision on the dispute at issue in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Articles 19, 24 and 40 TEU, Article 275 TFEU, and Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must be interpreted as meaning that the Court of Justice of the European Union has jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings, under Article 267 TFEU, on the validity of an act adopted on the basis of provisions relating to the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), such as Council Decision 2014/512/CFSP of 31 July 2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia's actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, as amended by Council Decision 2014/872/CFSP of 4 December 2014, provided that the request for a preliminary ruling relates either to the monitoring of that decision's compliance with Article 40 TEU, or to reviewing the legality of restrictive measures against natural or legal persons. 2. Examination of the second question has disclosed nothing capable of affecting the validity of Article 1(2)(b) to (d) and (3), and Article 7 of, and Annex III to, Decision 2014/512, as amended by Decision 2014/872, or of Articles 3 and 3a, Article 4(3) and (4), Article 5(2)(b) to (d) and (3), and Article 11 of, and Annexes II and VI to, Council Regulation (EU) No 833/2014 of 31 July 2014 concerning restrictive measures in view of Russia's actions destabilising the situation in Ukraine, as amended by Council Regulation (EU) No 1290/2014 of 4 December 2014. The principles of legal certainty andnulla poena sine lege certamust be interpreted as meaning that they do not preclude a Member State from imposing criminal penalties that are to be applied in the event of an infringement of the provisions of Regulation No 833/2014, as amended by Regulation No 1290/2014, in accordance with Article 8(1) of that regulation, before the scope of those provisions and, therefore, the scope of the associated criminal penalties, has been clarified by the Court of Justice of the European Union. 3. The expression `financial assistance' in Article 4(3)(b) of Regulation No 833/2014, as amended by Regulation No 1290/2014, must be interpreted as meaning that it does not include the processing of a payment, as such, by a bank or other financial institution. Article 5(2) of Regulation No 833/2014, as amended by Regulation No 1290/2014, must be interpreted as meaning that it prohibits the issuance, after 12 September 2014, of international certificates representative of share ownership (Global Depositary Receipts), pursuant to a depositary agreement concluded with one of the entities listed in Annex VI to Regulation No 833/2014, as amended by Regulation No 1290/2014, including cases where those certificates represent shares issued by one of those entities before that date.</p>
