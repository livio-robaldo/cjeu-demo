            <p>Article 15(1) of Regulation No 543/2008 provides as follows: `Without prejudice to Article 16(5) and Article 17(3), frozen and quick-frozen chickens may be marketed by way of business or trade within the [Union] only if the water content does not exceed the technically unavoidable values determined by the method of analysis described in Annex VI (drip method) or that in Annex VII (chemical method).'</p>

            <p>Article 16 of that regulation provides: `1.   Regular checks in accordance with Annex IX on the water absorbed or checks in accordance with Annex VI shall be carried out in the slaughterhouses at least once each working period of eight hours. Where these checks reveal that the amount of water absorbed is greater than the total water content permitted under the terms of this Regulation, account being taken of the water absorbed by the carcases during the stages of processing which are not subject to checking, and where, in any case, the amount of water absorbed is greater than the levels referred to in point 10 of Annex IX, or in point 7 of Annex VI, the necessary technical adjustments shall be made immediately by the slaughterhouse to the process. 2.   In all cases referred to in the second subparagraph of paragraph 1 and in any case at least once every two months, checks on water content referred to in Article 15(1) shall be carried out, by sampling, on frozen and quick-frozen chickens from each slaughterhouse in accordance with Annex VI or VII, to be chosen by the competent authority of the Member State. These checks shall not be conducted for carcases in respect of which proof is provided to the satisfaction of the competent authority that they are intended exclusively for export. 3.   The checks referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 shall be carried out by or under the responsibility of the competent authorities. The competent authorities may, in specific cases, apply the provisions of paragraph 1, and in particular of points 1 and 10 of Annex IX, and of paragraph 2 more stringently in respect of a given slaughterhouse, where this proves necessary to ensure compliance with the total water content permitted under this Regulation. They shall, in all cases where a batch of frozen or quick-frozen chickens was deemed not to comply with this Regulation, resume testing at the minimum frequency of checks referred to in paragraph 2 only after three successive checks according to Annex VI or VII, to be carried out by sampling from three different days of production within a maximum of four weeks, have shown negative results. The costs of these checks shall be paid by the slaughterhouse concerned. 4.   Where, in the case of air chilling, the results of checks referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2 show compliance with the criteria laid down in Annexes VI to IX during a period of six months, the frequency of the checks referred to in paragraph 1 may be reduced to once every month. Any failure to comply with the criteria laid down in these Annexes shall result in reinstatement of checks as referred to in paragraph 1. 5.   If the result of the checks referred to in paragraph 2 is in excess of the admissible limits, the batch concerned shall be deemed not to comply with this Regulation. In that event, however, the slaughterhouse concerned may request that a counter-analysis be carried out in the reference laboratory of the Member State, using a method to be chosen by the competent authority of the Member State. The costs of this counter-analysis shall be borne by the holder of the batch. 6.   Where the batch in question is deemed after such counter-analysis not to comply with this Regulation, the competent authority shall take the appropriate measures aimed at allowing it to be marketed as such within the [Union] only on condition that both individual and bulk packaging of the carcases concerned shall be marked by the slaughterhouse under the supervision of the competent authority with a tape or label bearing, in red capital letters, at least one of the indications set out in Annex X. The batch referred to in the first subparagraph shall remain under the supervision of the competent authority until it is dealt with in accordance with this paragraph or otherwise disposed of. If it is certified to the competent authority that the batch referred to in the first subparagraph is to be exported, the competent authority shall take all necessary measures to prevent the batch in question from being marketed within the [Union]. The indications provided for in the first subparagraph shall be marked in a conspicuous place so as to be easily visible, clearly legible and indelible. They shall not in any way be hidden, obscured or interrupted by other written or pictorial matter. The letters shall be at least 1 cm high on the individual packaging and 2 cm on bulk packaging.'</p>

The conformity of the products with the requirements laid down in the first subparagraph shall be examined in accordance with the standards or practices in force in the [Union]. However, the refund shall also be granted where, in the country of destination, the exported products are subject to specific obligatory conditions, in particular health and hygiene conditions, which do not correspond to the standards or practices in force within the [Union]. It shall be the responsibility of the exporter, at the request of the competent authority, to prove that the products comply with such obligatory conditions in force in the country of destination. In addition, specific provisions may be adopted for certain products.'</p>

            <p>In connection with its business producing and marketing chicken meat. Doux exports frozen chickens to third countries. In order to receive advance payment of the export refunds it provided guarantees. Among the conditions for granting those refunds is the requirement that the products exported are of `sound and fair marketable quality', in accordance with Article 28(1) of Regulation No 612/2009.</p>

            <p>FranceAgriMer, a French public administrative body responsible for grant of national and EU subsidies, carried out checks on chickens produced by Doux which were intended for export and found that their water content exceeded the prescribed limits laid down in Annexes VI and VII to Regulation No 543/2008. As a consequence, by a decision of 22 July 2013, FranceAgriMer froze the release of the securities relating to requests for refunds registered after 21 April 2013.</p>

            <p>On 20 September 2013, Doux brought an action before the referring court seeking annulment of FranceAgriMer's decision. It submits that that decision is vitiated by an error of law, as it makes the grant of export refunds for the export of frozen chicken meat dependent on the water content of that meat, whereas the limits referred to in Article 15 of that regulation are not applicable to that meat when it is intended for export outside the EU.</p>

            <p>In addition, Doux argues that exceeding those limits for water content does not affect the `sound and fair marketable quality' of the exported products, within the meaning of Article 28(1) of Regulation No 612/2009, and that its products comply with the standards and practices of the country of destination. Moreover, Doux claims that, in the absence of revision, those limits have become inappropriate and obsolete.</p>

            <p>FranceAgriMer considers that, under Article 28(1) of Regulation No 612/2009, export refunds should not be granted where the products concerned cannot be marketed within the European Union in normal conditions and if such products are not of `sound and fair marketable quality' on the date when the export declaration is accepted. Frozen chicken meat with a water content which exceeds the limits mentioned in Article 15 of Regulation No 543/2008 does not satisfy the conditions laid down in Article 28(1) of Regulation No 612/2009 and, therefore, its export does not give the right to a refund. FranceAgriMer observes that in 2012 and 2013, 98% of the checks carried out on frozen chicken meat exported by Doux produced results which do not comply with that requirement.</p>

            <p>As regards the checks carried out on water content of the frozen chickens at issue in the main proceedings, Doux submits that they cannot be relied on against it on the ground that the French legislature has not laid down implementing rules for the checks provided for in Articles 15 to 17 of Regulation No 543/2008 at all stages of marketing. That company also challenges the refusal by FranceAgriMer of its request, under Article 16(5) thereof, for a counter-analysis, as provided for in cases in which the results of checks referred to in Article 16(2) of that regulation exceed the admissible limits.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. The examination of the third question did not bring to light any evidence able to affect the validity of the limits for water content in frozen chicken meat laid down in Article 15(1) and Annexes VI and VII to Commission Regulation (EC) No 543/2008 of 16 June 2008 laying down detailed rules for the application of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards the marketing standards for poultrymeat, as amended by Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1239/2012 of 19 December 2012. 2. Article 28(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 612/2009 of 7 July 2009 on laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 173/2011 of 23 February 2011, must be interpreted as meaning that frozen or quick-frozen chickens with a water content exceeding the limits set by Regulation No 543/2008, as amended by Implementing Regulation No 1239/2012, are not marketable in normal conditions on the territory of the European Union and do not satisfy the requirement of sound and fair marketable quality, even if they are accompanied by a health certificate issued by the competent authority. 3. Since Annexes VI and VII to Regulation No 543/2008, as amended by Implementing Regulation No 1239/2012, are sufficiently precise for the purpose of carrying out the checks on frozen and quick-frozen chickens intended for export with export refunds, the fact that a Member State has not adopted practical measures, whose adoption is provided for in Article 18(2) of that regulation, does not prevent those checks from being relied on against the undertakings concerned. 4. An exporter of frozen or quick-frozen chickens may, in accordance with Article 118(2) and Article 119(1), second subparagraph, of Regulation (EC) No 450/2008 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2008 laying down the Community Customs Code (Modernised Customs Code) may, first, be present or represented when the goods are examined and when samples are taken and, second, may request a further examination or sampling of the goods if he considers that the results obtained by the competent authorities are not valid.</p>
