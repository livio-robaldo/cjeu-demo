                <p>However, under the current measures regarding the security of gas supply that have been taken at Union level, Member States still enjoy a large margin of discretion as to the choice of measures. Where the security of supply of a Member State is threatened, there is a clear risk that measures developed unilaterally by that Member State may jeopardise the proper functioning of the internal gas market and the supply of gas to customers. Recent experience has demonstrated the reality of that risk. In order to allow the internal gas market to function even in the face of a shortage of supply, it is necessary to provide for solidarity and coordination in the response to supply crises, both concerning preventive action and the reaction to concrete disruptions of supply. ...</p>

It can also lead to severe economic damage across the Union's economy. Likewise, the disruption of gas supply can have a severe social impact, in particular on vulnerable groups of customers.</p>

            <p>In this regard, the referring court notes, first, that Decree No 2014-328 includes within the national definition of `protected customers' non-domestic customers connected to the distribution network that have not accepted, under a contract, an interruptible supply, which are not necessarily `small and medium-sized enterprises' within the meaning of point 1(a) of the second paragraph of Article 2 of Regulation No 994/2010. The definition of `protected customers' thus adopted in the decree therefore goes beyond the ambit of the definition contained in the regulation. The French authorities maintain, however, that those additional customers correspond to sites of modest size which, even if they belong to large enterprises, share many characteristics with small and medium-sized enterprises. Furthermore, according to those authorities, such a broad definition pertains to the additional obligations which Member States may impose, for reasons of security of gas supply, in accordance with Article 8(2) of that regulation.</p>

The lawfulness of Decree No 2014-328 therefore also depends on whether Article 8(5) of Regulation No 994/2010 prevents a Member State from imposing such obligations on natural gas suppliers.</p>

The Court also held that Directive 2004/67 accorded a broad margin of discretion to the Member States with regard to the methods of achieving the aims pursued by the directive (see, to that effect, judgment of 17 July 2008, Commission v Spain, C‑207/07, not published, EU:C:2008:428, paragraphs 43 and 44).</p>

            <p>23 By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 8(2) of Regulation No 994/2010 must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that in the main proceedings, that imposes on natural gas suppliers a gas storage obligation, the scope of which includes customers who are not among the `protected customers' listed in point 1 of the second paragraph of Article 2 of that regulation.</p>

It submits that this category of customers encompasses entities of modest size, such as small enterprises, small branches of large enterprises, small businesses belonging to integrated networks or small industrial plants belonging to a larger enterprise, the larger entities not being connected to the distribution network, but directly to the transmission network.</p>

            <p>The fact that the gas consumption of such entities is, potentially, similar to that of a small or medium-sized enterprise is irrelevant in that regard. As is apparent from recitals 9 and 10 of Regulation No 994/2010, the list of `protected customers' in point 1(a) of the second paragraph of Article 2 of Regulation No 994/2010 of that regulation is not so much based on the volume of gas consumption of those customers as it is on the specific protection of which they are in need in the event that the gas supply is interrupted, given their vulnerability.</p>

            <p>It is therefore appropriate to examine whether a Member State can, under Article 8(2) of Regulation No 994/2010, impose on natural gas suppliers measures intended to safeguard the supply of gas to a wider group of customers than the `protected customers' listed in point 1(a) of the second paragraph of Article 2 of that regulation.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it follows from Article 8(2) of Regulation No 994/2010 that Member States have the possibility of adopting two types of measures that go beyond those which they are required to impose on natural gas undertakings that they identify in accordance with paragraph 8(1) of that regulation and which are limited, as recalled in paragraph 24 of the present judgment, to protected customers.</p>

            <p>In the second place, those Member States may impose `additional obligations' on natural gas undertakings for reasons of security of gas supply. In that regard, the use of the word `additional' underlines the fact that they are supplementary obligations, which are different in nature from the measures mentioned in Article 8(1) of Regulation No 994/2010, to which Article 8(2) of that regulation does not refer in respect of those obligations.</p>

            <p>Such legislation, in so far as it requires suppliers to hold necessarily and exclusively in France sufficient stocks of natural gas in order to comply with their obligations to safeguard security of supply in the event of crisis, is incompatible with the second sentence of Article 8(5) of Regulation No 994/2010, which, as has been recalled, prohibits the competent authority from requiring the standards laid down in Article 8 to be met based on infrastructure located only within the territory of the Member State concerned.</p>

            <p>Although it is the case that the French legislation allows the Minister responsible to take account of the `other regulatory instruments' of the gas supplier concerned, the referring court has not provided sufficient information to clarify the nature and scope in practice of the assessment which it is for the competent authority to make in that respect.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it falls to the referring court to interpret national law and to ascertain whether the power which the competent authority has under the national legislation to `take account of the other regulatory instruments' of the suppliers concerned ensures that it is actually possible for them to meet their obligations at regional level or at Union level.</p>

            <p>In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the second question is that Article 8(5) of Regulation No 994/2010 must be interpreted as precluding national legislation that requires natural gas suppliers to comply with their obligations to hold gas stocks, in order to guarantee security of supply in the event of crisis, necessarily and exclusively through infrastructure located within the territory of the Member State. In the present case, it is for the referring court to ascertain whether the power which the competent authority has under the national legislation to take account of the `other regulatory instruments' available to the suppliers concerned ensures that it is actually possible for them to meet their obligations at regional level or at Union level.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fifth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 8(2) of Regulation (EU) No 994/2010 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 October 2010 concerning measures to safeguard security of gas supply and repealing Council Directive 2004/67/EC must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation, such as that in the main proceedings, that imposes on natural gas suppliers a gas storage obligation, the scope of which includes customers who are not among the protected customers listed in point 1 of the second paragraph of Article 2 of that regulation, provided that the conditions set out in Article 8(2) of the regulation are complied with, a matter which it is for the referring court to ascertain. 2. Article 8(5) of Regulation No 994/2010 must be interpreted as precluding national legislation that requires natural gas suppliers to comply with their obligations to hold gas stocks, in order to guarantee security of supply in the event of crisis, necessarily and exclusively through infrastructure located within the territory of the Member State. In the present case, it is however for the referring court to ascertain whether the power which the competent authority has under the national legislation to take account of the `other regulatory instruments' available to the suppliers concerned ensures that it is actually possible for them to meet their obligations at regional level or at European Union level.</p>
