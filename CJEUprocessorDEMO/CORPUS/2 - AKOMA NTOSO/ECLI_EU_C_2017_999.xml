            <p>The present cases concern a series of measures implemented by the Spanish authorities in relation to the switch-over from analogue broadcasting to digital broadcasting throughout Spain, apart from the Comunidad Autónoma de Castilla-La Mancha (Autonomous Community of Castilla-La Mancha, Spain) ( `the measure at issue').</p>

          <content eId="para_6321__content">
            <p>The Kingdom of Spain established a regulatory framework to promote the transition from analogue to digital broadcasting, by promulgating, in particular, Ley 10/2005 de Medidas Urgentes para el Impulso de la Televisión Digital Terrestre, de Liberalización de la Televisión por Cable y de Fomento del Pluralismo (Law No 10/2005 on urgent measures for the promotion of digital terrestrial television, liberalisation of cable television and support of pluralism) of 14 June 2005 (BOE No 142 of 15 June 2005, p. 20562), and Real Decreto 944/2005 por el que se aprueba el Plan técnico nacional de la televisión digital terrestre (Royal Decree 944/2005 approving the National Technical Plan for digital terrestrial television) of 29 July 2005 (BOE No 181 of 30 July 2005, p. 27006). Under that royal decree, national private and public broadcasters were required to ensure, respectively, that 96% and 98% of the population received digital terrestrial television (DTT).</p>

          <content eId="para_6322__content">
            <p>In order to enable the switch-over from analogue television to DTT, the Spanish authorities divided the Spanish territory into three separate areas: `Area I', `Area II' and `Area III'. Area II, the area at issue in the present proceedings, includes remote and less urbanised regions representing 2.5% of the Spanish population. In that area, due to a lack of commercial interest, broadcasters did not invest in digitisation, which led the Spanish authorities to put public funding in place.</p>

            <p>In September 2007, the Consejo de Ministros (Council of Ministers, Spain) adopted the National Plan for the Transition to DTT, the objective of which was to achieve a rate of coverage of the Spanish population by DTT comparable to the rate of coverage of that population by analogue television in 2007, that is to say, more than 98% of that population and all or virtually all of the population in the Autonomous Communities of the Basque Country, Catalonia and Navarre (Spain).</p>

            <p>In order to achieve the coverage objectives set out for DTT, the Spanish authorities made provision for the grant of public funding, in order inter alia to support the terrestrial digitisation process in Area II and, more particularly, within the regions of the Autonomous Communities in that area.</p>

            <p>In February 2008, the Ministerio de Industria, Turismo y Comercio (the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade, Spain; `the MITT') adopted a decision aimed at improving the telecommunications infrastructures and establishing the criteria and distribution of the funding for the actions aimed at developing the information society under a plan called the `Plan Avanza'. The budget approved under that decision was allocated in part to the digitisation of television in Area II.</p>

            <p>That digitisation was carried out between July and November 2008. The MITT subsequently transferred funds to the Autonomous Communities, which undertook to fund the remaining costs of the operation from their own budgets.</p>

            <p>In October 2008, the Council of Ministers decided to allocate additional funding in order to extend and complete DTT coverage within the context of the digital switch-over projects scheduled to be completed during the first half of 2009.</p>

            <p>The Autonomous Communities subsequently began the process of extending DTT coverage.

            <p>On 18 May 2009 the European Commission received a complaint from SES Astra SA concerning a State aid scheme implemented by the Spanish authorities in relation to the switch-over from analogue television to DTT in Area II. According to SES Astra, that scheme constituted non-notified aid liable to distort competition between the terrestrial and satellite broadcasting platforms.</p>

          <content eId="para_6330__content">
            <p>By letter of 29 September 2010 the Commission informed the Kingdom of Spain that it had decided to initiate the procedure laid down in Article 108(2) TFEU in respect of the aid scheme at issue for the whole territory of Spain, with the exception of the Autonomous Community of Castilla-La Mancha, for which a separate procedure was opened.</p>

          <content eId="para_6331__content">
            <p>The Commission subsequently adopted the decision at issue, in which Article 1 of the operative part states that the State aid granted to the operators of the terrestrial television platform for the deployment, maintenance and operation of the DTT network in Area II was put into effect in breach of Article 108(3) TFEU, and that it is incompatible with the internal market, except for the aid which was granted in compliance with the principle of technological neutrality. Article 3 of the operative part of that decision orders the recovery of that incompatible aid from the DTT operators, whether they received the aid directly or indirectly.</p>

          <content eId="para_6332__content">
            <p>In the grounds of the decision at issue, the Commission considered, in the first place, that the various acts adopted at the central level and the agreements concluded between the MITT and the Autonomous Communities constituted the basis of the aid scheme for the extension of DTT in Area II. In practice, the Autonomous Communities applied the Spanish Government's guidelines on the extension of DTT.</p>

          <content eId="para_6333__content">
            <p>In the second place, the Commission found that the measure at issue had to be regarded as State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU. In that respect, the Commission noted, in particular, that the Spanish authorities had put forward only the case of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country in order to support their claim that the measure did not constitute State aid according to the conditions laid down by the Court of Justice in the judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark Trans and Regierungspräsidium Magdeburg( C‑280/00, Altmark, EU:C:2003:415). However, the first condition laid down in that judgment ( `the first Altmark condition'), according to which the recipient undertaking must actually be required to discharge public service obligations and those obligations must be clearly defined, was not satisfied, in the Commission's view. In addition, the failure to ensure the least costs to that Autonomous Community meant that the fourth condition laid down in that judgment ( `the fourth Altmark condition') was not satisfied either.</p>

          <content eId="para_6334__content">
            <p>In the third place, the Commission found that the measure at issue could not be regarded as State aid compatible with the internal market, pursuant to Article 107(3)(c) TFEU, notwithstanding the fact that that measure was intended to achieve a well-defined objective in the public interest and that there was a market failure on the market concerned. According to the Commission, since that measure did not respect the principle of technological neutrality, it was not proportionate and was not an appropriate instrument for ensuring that the residents of Area II received free-to-air channels.</p>

          <content eId="para_6335__content">
            <p>In the fourth place, the Commission considered that, since the operation of a terrestrial platform had not been sufficiently clearly defined as a public service, the measure at issue could not be justified under Article 106(2) TFEU.</p>

            <p>In that respect, the General Court found that the operation of the DTT broadcasting network in Area II had not been defined by the Member State concerned as a service of general economic interest ( `SGEI'), within the meaning of EU law, either at the national level or at the level of the Autonomous Community of the Basque Country in the interinstitutional conventions concluded with the latter.</p>

However, in view of the cumulative nature of the conditions laid down in the judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark ( C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415), the General Court concluded that, since the first Altmark condition was not satisfied, it was not necessary to annul the decision at issue.</p>

            <p>It must be borne in mind that classification as `State aid' requires all the conditions laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU to be satisfied. Thus, for the purpose of a classification as State aid, that provision presupposes in particular that there is an advantage conferred on an undertaking (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 October 2015, EasyPay and Finance Engineering, C‑185/14, EU:C:2015:716, paragraphs 35 and 36 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Thus, first, the recipient undertaking must actually be required to discharge public service obligations and those obligations must be clearly defined. Secondly, the parameters on the basis of which the compensation is calculated must be established in advance in an objective and transparent manner. Thirdly, the compensation must not exceed what is necessary to cover all or part of the costs incurred in discharging the public service obligations. Fourthly, the level of compensation needed must be determined on the basis of an analysis of the costs which a typical undertaking, well run and adequately equipped so as to be able to meet the necessary public service requirements, would have incurred in discharging those obligations.</p>

In that respect, it relied on an analysis of the first and fourth Altmark conditions, following which it confirmed, in paragraphs 79 and 88 of the judgment in Case T‑462/13( EU:T:2015:902) respectively, the Commission's assessment that those conditions were not satisfied.</p>

After rejecting the appellants' arguments that those two conditions were satisfied, the General Court held, in paragraph 126 of the judgment in Case T‑487/13( EU:T:2015:899), that, since the conditions laid down in the judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark ( C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415), were cumulative, the Commission had not erred in law in finding, first, that there was State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU and, secondly, that that aid was not compatible with the internal market, pursuant to Article 106(2) TFEU.</p>

That issue must be resolved before the one which consists in examining, where necessary, if incompatible aid is nevertheless necessary to the performance of the tasks assigned to the recipient of the measure at issue, under Article 106(2) TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 8 March 2017, Viasat Broadcasting UK v Commission, C‑660/15 P, EU:C:2017:178, paragraph 34).</p>

It is nevertheless the case that, as the Advocate General emphasised in point 97 of his Opinion, the first Altmark condition, according to which the recipient undertaking must actually be required to discharge public service obligations which must be clearly defined, also applies where the derogation laid down in Article 106(2) TFEU has been invoked (see, to that effect, judgments of 21 March 1974, BRT and Société belge des auteurs, compositeurs et éditeurs, 127/73, EU:C:1974:25, paragraph 22, and of 11 April 1989, Saeed Flugreisen and Silver Line Reisebüro, 66/86, EU:C:1989:140, paragraph 56).</p>

            <p>In the first place, the appellants submit that the General Court manifestly distorted the wording of the national provisions and, moreover, referred to those provisions selectively. In particular, Ley 32/2003, General de Telecomunicaciones (General Law 32/2003 on Telecommunications) of 3 November 2003 (BOE No 264, of 4 November 2003, p. 38890, `Law 32/2003') expressly classifies the operation of radio and television networks as a `service of general interest'. In that respect, contrary to the General Court's assertions in paragraph 57 of the judgment in Case T‑462/13( EU:T:2015:902), paragraph 57 of the judgment in Case T‑465/13( EU:T:2015:900), paragraph 104 of the judgment in Case T‑487/13( EU:T:2015:899) and paragraph 86 of the judgment in Case T‑541/13( EU:T:2015:898), it is possible to entrust SGEI obligations to all of the operators in a sector, in particular to ensure universal access to that service. Indeed, that is the aim pursued by the Spanish legislation on broadcasting, by imposing minimum coverage obligations on the entire sector concerned. In addition, contrary to the General Court's interpretation, various legislative acts adopted by the Spanish authorities expressly refer to terrestrial technology.</p>

            <p>In the second place, the appellants submit that the judgments under appeal contain assertions that are manifestly at odds with the documents submitted to the General Court. The General Court erroneously stated that the appellants were not at any time able to determine what public service obligations were entrusted to DTT network operators, either by Spanish law or by the operating conventions, let alone adduce evidence to that effect (paragraph 72 of the judgment in Case T‑462/13( EU:T:2015:902), paragraph 73 of the judgment in Case T‑465/13( EU:T:2015:900), paragraph 115 of the judgment in Case T‑487/13( EU:T:2015:899) and paragraph 103 of the judgment in Case T‑541/13( EU:T:2015:898)). The appellants refer, in that respect, to the conventions that the Basque authorities concluded with Itelazpi (Case C‑66/16 P), the public contract concluded between the Catalan authorities and Retevisión, as well as the relevant specifications document (Case C‑67/16 P), the agreements and conventions adopted by the Government of Navarre (Case C‑68/16 P), as well as the contract and the specifications document relating to the call for tenders launched by the Comunidad Autónoma de La Rioja (Autonomous Community of La Rioja, Spain) (Case C‑69/16 P).</p>

According to the appellants, the General Court should have faulted the Commission for failing to take those calls for tenders into consideration, as it did in paragraph 85 of the judgment in Case T‑465/13( EU:T:2015:900) and paragraph 60 of the judgment in Case T‑541/13( EU:T:2015:898), in relation to the fourth Altmark condition.</p>

Thus, the General Court should have taken into account the case-law of the Tribunal Supremo (Supreme Court, Spain) relating to the measure at issue and the relevant Spanish legislation. In addition, in paragraph 71 of the judgment in Case T‑462/13( EU:T:2015:902), paragraph 72 of the judgment in Case T‑465/13( EU:T:2015:900) and paragraph 102 of the judgment in Case T‑541/13( EU:T:2015:898), the General Court incorrectly rejected Ley 31/1987 de Ordenación de las Telecomunicaciones (Law 31/1987 on the organisation of broadcasting) of 18 December 1987 (BOE No 303, of 19 December 1987, p. 37409), which specifically classifies the terrestrial technology as a public service, on the ground that it had not been adduced before the General Court.</p>

            <p>It should be noted, first of all, that the Court of Justice has consistently held that where the General Court has established or assessed the facts, the Court of Justice has jurisdiction, under Article 256 TFEU, solely to review the legal characterisation of those facts and the conclusions in law drawn from them. The appraisal of the facts by the General Court does not therefore constitute, save where the clear sense of the evidence produced before it is distorted, a question of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice (see, inter alia, judgment of 10 November 2016, DTS Distribuidora de Televisión Digital v Commission, C‑449/14 P, EU:C:2016:848, paragraph 43 and the case-law cited).</p>

It held that the mere fact that a service is designated in national law as being of general interest does not mean that any operator providing that service is entrusted with performing clearly defined public service obligations within the meaning of the judgment of 24 July 2003, Altmark ( C‑280/00, EU:C:2003:415). It also noted that it did not follow from Law 32/2003 that all telecommunications services in Spain were in the nature of SGEIs within the meaning of that judgment and, moreover, that that law expressly provided that services of general interest within the meaning of that law had to be supplied in the context of a framework of free competition.</p>

            <p>By the fifth part of their single ground of appeal, the appellants essentially argue that the General Court wrongly adopted a formalist approach by requiring that, in order to meet the first Altmark condition, the provisions of national law defining and entrusting the SGEI tasks at issue must contain the term `public service'.</p>

            <p>That argument is based on a misreading of the judgments under appeal. It in no way follows from paragraph 63 of the judgment in Case T‑462/13( EU:T:2015:902), paragraph 58 of the judgment in Case T‑465/13( EU:T:2015:900), paragraph 91 of the judgment in Case T‑487/13( EU:T:2015:899) and paragraph 93 of the judgment in Case T‑541/13( EU:T:2015:898), that the General Court set out a requirement that the term `public service' must be used in order to satisfy the first Altmark condition.</p>
