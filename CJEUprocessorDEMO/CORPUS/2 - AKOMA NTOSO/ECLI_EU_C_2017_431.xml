            <p>It was specified in the tender specifications that the medicinal products that were the subject matter of the contract were to be `obtained from Slovenian plasma'. On enquiry from an economic operator, that requirement was justified by reference to the principle that supplies must come as a matter of priority from medicinal products manufactured industrially from plasma collected in Slovenia, as set out in Article 6(71) of the Law on medicinal products.</p>

            <p>Disputing that national origin requirement for medicinal products derived from plasma, Medisanus requested the hospital to withdraw the requirement and amend the tender specifications accordingly. Indeed, since the Institute enjoys a monopoly for blood collection in Slovenia, by definition it is the only body that is able to supply medicinal products obtained from plasma collected in Slovenia and thus satisfy the national origin requirement for the plasma as prescribed in the tender specifications. However, according to Medisanus, such a requirement infringes EU law.</p>

            <p>The hospital rejected Medisanus's request on the ground that the requirements stemmed from national legislation, that they were justified from a scientific point of view and that, in addition, they were consistent with an objective of EU self-sufficiency set out in Article 110 of Directive 2001/83. The contracting authority also pointed out that medicinal products derived from Slovenian plasma failed to meet the total demand of the Slovenian population for medicinal products derived from plasma. Part of that demand would therefore be covered by a call for tenders relating to the purchase of medicinal products obtained from blood originating in various Member States.</p>

            <p>In the second place, Article 10 of the Law on the supply of blood provides that the Institute, a public body, is, inter alia, responsible at national level for the supply of blood and of components and medicinal products obtained from blood and plasma.

            <p>In the third place, Article 6(71) of the Law on medicinal products lays down the principle that supplies must come as a matter of priority from medicinal products manufactured industrially from plasma collected in Slovenia ( `Slovenian plasma'). Accordingly, the marketing of medicinal products derived from plasma collected outside Slovenia is authorised, as a matter of principle, only in the event that the medicinal products derived from Slovenian plasma do not meet the total demand ( `the priority supply principle').</p>

            <p>In practice, the Institute allocates the quantities of Slovenian plasma that are not used for transfusion purposes to the manufacture of medicinal products. To this end, the Institute organises procedures for public service contracts with a view to selecting the economic operator that will undertake the manufacturing process, while the Institute will continue to own the plasma and become the owner of the medicinal products obtained from that plasma. The Institute then supplies those medicinal products to hospitals against payment of an amount equivalent to their production costs.</p>

Since the degree of protection may vary from one Member State to another, Member States must be allowed a measure of discretion (see, inter alia, judgments of 11 September 2008, Commission v Germany, C‑141/07, EU:C:2008:492, paragraph 51; of 19 May 2009, Apothekerkammer des Saarlandes and Others, C‑171/07 and C‑172/07, EU:C:2009:316, paragraph 19; of 21 June 2012, Susisalo and Others, C‑84/11, EU:C:2012:374, paragraph 28; of 5 December 2013, Venturini and Others, C‑159/12 to C‑161/12, EU:C:2013:791, paragraph 59; and of 19 October 2016, Deutsche Parkinson Vereinigung, C‑148/15, EU:C:2016:776, paragraph 30).</p>

However, the priority supply principle at issue in the main proceedings, in that it excludes economic operators wishing to import into Slovenia medicinal products derived from plasma coming also from voluntary unpaid blood donations, collected in other Member States, is in clear contradiction to that concept underlying the objective of EU self-sufficiency.

            <p>It is not therefore evident that the objective of encouraging and maintaining a high level of voluntary unpaid blood donations necessarily requires recourse to the national origin requirement at issue in the main proceedings. In those circumstances, the Court finds that the priority supply principle is disproportionate.</p>

            <p>That finding cannot be called into question by the argument that a system of priority supply, such as that described in paragraphs 41 to 48 of the present judgment, may be regarded as the least detrimental solution to the free movement of goods, having regard in particular to the fact that the medicinal products are supplied to hospitals against payment of an amount corresponding exclusively to their production costs.</p>

            <p>It is true that a system of plasma collection such as that at issue in the main proceedings has been established in a global context characterised by a prolonged and undeniable shortage of quality blood and plasma and by a highly concentrated sector for industrial processing of blood and plasma into medicinal products. Moreover, as the Commission has pointed out in its written observations, that continuing tendency induces the few undertakings working in that field to prefer selling medicinal products derived from plasma in countries that can pay a higher price or buy them on a larger scale, and smaller States are thus facing a significantly higher price for medicinal products derived from plasma.</p>

            <p>Admittedly, interests of an economic nature that aim at maintaining a quality hospital service that is safe and accessible to all may come within the derogation on grounds of public health set out in Article 36 TFEU, to the extent that they contribute to the attainment of a high level of health protection (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 September 2008, Commission v Germany, C‑141/07, EU:C:2008:492, paragraph 60).</p>

            <p>However, a system of priority supply of medicinal products manufactured industrially from Slovenian plasma, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, cannot be considered to be necessary to avoid higher costs for medicinal products derived from plasma, since the price of all medicinal products manufactured industrially from plasma, whether in Slovenia or in another Member State, is set on the same basis, namely voluntary unpaid blood donations.</p>

            <p>Having regard to all of the foregoing considerations, the Court finds that a restriction such as that stemming from the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings has not been shown to be an appropriate means of attaining the objectives invoked and cannot therefore be regarded as justified by the achievement of those objectives.</p>

            <p>Consequently, the answer to the question referred is that Article 2 and Article 23(2) and (8) of Directive 2004/18, and Article 34 TFEU read in conjunction with Article 36 TFEU, must be interpreted as precluding a clause in the tender specifications for a public contract which, in accordance with the law of the Member State to which the contracting authority belongs, requires medicinal products derived from plasma, which are the subject matter of the public procurement at issue, to be obtained from plasma collected in that Member State.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national tribunal, the decision on costs is a matter for that tribunal.

On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules: Article 2 and Article 23(2) and (8) of Directive 2004/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts, and Article 34 TFEU read in conjunction with Article 36 TFEU, must be interpreted as precluding a clause in the tender specifications for a public contract which, in accordance with the law of the Member State to which the contracting authority belongs, requires medicinal products derived from plasma, which are the subject matter of the public procurement at issue, to be obtained from plasma collected in that Member State.</p>
