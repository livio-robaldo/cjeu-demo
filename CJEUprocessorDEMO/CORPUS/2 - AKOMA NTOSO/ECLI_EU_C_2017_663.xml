The appellant claimed, in that regard, in essence, that the Commission could act on that proposal by proposing the adoption of a legal act on the basis of Article 122(1), Article 122(2) and Article 136(1)(b) TFEU and rules of international law.</p>

Consequently, it dismissed the action as unfounded.</p>

            <p>By his first ground of appeal, the appellant argues that by holding, in paragraphs 28 to 32 and 34 of the judgment under appeal, that the contested decision satisfied the requirements arising from the obligation to state reasons, as laid down in Article 296 TFEU, the General Court erred in law.</p>

            <p>First, he claims, the General Court wrongly held, in paragraph 28 of the contested judgment, that the mere fact that the Commission refers, in the contested decision, to Article 4(2)(b) of Regulation No 211/2011, constituted a sufficient reason in the light of the case-law on the obligation to state reasons. Such a reference does not constitute a detailed and clear statement of the `manifest' nature of the Commission's lack of competence within the meaning of that provision.</p>

            <p>Secondly, according to the appellant, the Court's finding in paragraph 27 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission carried out `a detailed examination of the provisions of the Treaty referred to in [the] proposal (Articles 119 [TFEU] to 144 TFEU) and all other possible legal bases' is not sufficient either.</p>

            <p>Finally, the General Court erred in finding, in paragraphs 30 and 31 of the judgment under appeal, that the statement of reasons for the contested decision was sufficient in the light of the nature of that decision and the context in which it was adopted. That reasoning of the General Court is, it is claimed, irrelevant to the manifest nature of the Commission's lack of competence and, on the other hand, erroneously establishes a causal link between the so-called lack `of clarity and precision with regard to the alleged legal basis of the Commission's competence to submit a proposal for a legal act', referred to in paragraph 30 of the judgment under appeal, and the obligation to state the reasons upon which the contested decision was taken.</p>

            <p>In that regard, in so far as, by its first ground of appeal, the appellant argues that the General Court erred in law by finding that that decision was sufficiently reasoned, it should be noted that the obligation to inform the organisers of the reasons for the refusal to register their proposed ECI, as provided for in the second subparagraph of Article 4(3) of Regulation No 211/2011, constitutes a specific expression, with regard to the ECI, of the obligation to state reasons for legal acts enshrined in Article 296 TFEU. It has been consistently held, with regard to that article, that the statement of reasons must be appropriate to the measure at issue and must disclose in a clear and unequivocal fashion the reasoning followed by the institution which adopted the measure in question, in such a way as to enable the persons concerned to ascertain the reasons for the measure and to enable the competent Court to exercise its power of review (see, inter alia, judgment of 6 March 2003, Interporc v Commission, C‑41/00 P, EU:C:2003:125, paragraph 55).</p>

            <p>As is also apparent from settled case-law, the requirement to state reasons must be assessed by reference to the circumstances of the case. It is not necessary for the reasoning to go into all of the relevant facts and points of law, since the question whether the statement of reasons for a measure meets the requirements of Article 296 TFEU must be assessed with regard not only to its wording but also to its context and to all the legal rules governing the matter in question (judgments of 29 September 2011, Elf Aquitaine v Commission, C‑521/09 P, EU:C:2011:620, paragraph 150 and of 21 December 2016, Club Hotel Loutraki and Others v Commission, C‑131/15 P, EU:C:2016:989, paragraph 47).</p>

            <p>In the light of those principles, correctly recalled in paragraphs 22 to 24 of the judgment under appeal, it is appropriate to consider whether the General Court erred in law by holding that the Commission had complied with the obligation to state reasons in adopting the contested decision.</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is common ground, as the General Court pointed out in paragraph 28 of the judgment under appeal, that that decision indicated that the refusal to register the proposed ECI at issue was justified by the failure to meet the condition laid down in Article 4(2)(b) of Regulation No 211/2011. In that regard, that decision stated that the Commission considered that neither the provisions relating to the European Union's economic and monetary policy relied on in that proposal, namely Articles 119 to 144 TFEU, nor any other legal basis enabled it to submit a proposal for a legal act of the European Union for the purposes of the application of the Treaties as intended by the proposed ECI at issue. In that context, the Commission expressed its view, in particular, on Article 136(1) TFEU and explained the reasons why it considered that that provision could not constitute an appropriate legal basis for that purpose.</p>

Thus, where that refusal is, as in the present case, based on Article 4(2)(b) of Regulation No 211/2011, that statement must state the reasons why it considers that that proposal is manifestly outside the scope of the powers under which it may submit a proposal for a legal act of the European Union for the purpose of implementing the Treaties.</p>

In accordance with paragraphs 1 and 2 of that article, information relating to the subject matter and objectives of the proposed ECI, provided by the organisers of the ECI, compulsorily or on an optional basis, in accordance with Annex II to that regulation, must therefore be taken into consideration.</p>

            <p>The appellant claims, in particular, that it follows from Article 122(1) and (2) TFEU that the measures which the Commission is entitled to propose to the Council to take under that article may be corrective or preventive and are intended to address severe difficulties or a serious threat of such difficulties which may pose a threat to the objectives of the Union.

The adoption of the principle of the state of necessity in an EU instrument would constitute such an appropriate measure. Since the General Court considered, nevertheless, that the proposed ECI at issue would be manifestly outside the scope of the Commission's powers, it misinterpreted Article 122 TFEU.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, the appellant disputes, in the first place, the arguments of the General Court, in paragraph 41 of the judgment under appeal, drawn from the judgment of 27 November 2012, Pringle ( C‑370/12, EU:C:2012:756). The General Court erred in law by comparing the measure proposed by the ECI at issue and the European Stability Mechanism ( `the ESM'), specifically referred to in that judgment and fundamentally different from that measure. The purpose of the proposed ECI at issue is simply to include in EU legislation the principle of the state of necessity in the light of the severe difficulties of the Hellenic Republic arising from its debt and not to create a financing mechanism such as the ESM.</p>

It is clear from a reading of that article that, contrary to what the General Court held, the spirit of solidarity between the Member States referred to in that article is not equivalent to assistance understood to be financial between the Member States.</p>

            <p>In the first place, it is claimed, the inclusion of the principle of the state of necessity in EU legislation is not, in many respects, comparable to the ESM. In the second place, the General Court wrongly held that the procedure for declaring a state of necessity is initiated by the Member States and not by the European Union. The proposed ECI at issue, it is claimed, indicates that it is the European Union that would approve such a declaration, in a spirit of solidarity. In the third place, the General Court wrongly found, in paragraph 49 of the contested judgment, that the adoption of the principle of the state of necessity applies not only to a Member State's debt to the Union, but also to the debts incurred by that State towards other legal or natural persons, whether public or private. The adoption of that principle would in fact only cover the debt of a Member State to the European Union. In any event, the Commission could have given a partial reply to the proposed ECI at issue by limiting its subject matter to that single debt, which, it is claimed, manifestly falls within the scope of Article 122(2) TFEU.</p>

            <p>Consequently, the General Court was entitled to consider, in paragraph 49 of the judgment under appeal, that the adoption of the principle of the state of necessity forming the subject matter of the proposed ECI at issue cannot be regarded as a measure of `assistance granted by the Union' within the meaning of that provision because it would cover not only debts owed by the Member States to the Union, but also debts owed by the Member States to other natural or legal persons, both public and private.</p>

Moreover, his argument is contradicted by other assertions set out in the appeal, according to which the purpose of the proposal is to enable Member States, that find themselves in a state of necessity, to suspend or cancel a part of their debt, owed not only to the Union but also to other Member States. Consequently, that argument cannot succeed.</p>

            <p>By his third ground of appeal, the appellant alleges that the General Court, in paragraphs 57 to 60 of the judgment under appeal, misinterpreted Article 136(1) TFEU. Contrary to what the General Court considered, the principle of the state of necessity could be enshrined in EU law on the basis of Article 136 TFEU, the purpose of which is, inter alia, to contribute to the `the proper functioning of economic and monetary union'.</p>

            <p>In that regard, the applicant maintains that the assertion, in paragraph 58 of the judgment under appeal, that the adoption of the principle of the state of necessity would result in replacing the free will of contracting parties with a legislative mechanism for the unilateral writing-off of sovereign debt, which this provision clearly does not permit, is legally flawed. The adoption of that principle would enable a Member State facing severe difficulties to temporarily suspend the payment of all its debts in order to focus its economic policy on growth, thereby encouraging economic investments that promote the latter, which would undoubtedly contribute to the proper functioning of economic and monetary union as referred to in Article 136(1) TFEU. The applicant refers, in this context and by way of illustration, to the decision of the European Council of 21 July 2011, with the consequence that the decision on the cancellation of a Member State's public debt may be based on EU law.</p>

Since the appellant has been unsuccessful and the Commission has applied for costs against it, the appellant must be ordered to pay the costs relating to the present appeal proceedings. On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby: 1. Dismisses the appeal; 2. Orders Mr Alexios Anagnostakis to pay the costs.</p>
