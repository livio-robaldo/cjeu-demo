It shall also be regarded as a misleading omission when, taking account of the matters described in paragraph 1, a trader hides or provides in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner such material information as referred to in that paragraph or fails to identify the commercial intent of the commercial practice if not already apparent from the context, and where, in either case, this causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise. 3.   Where the medium used to communicate the commercial practice imposes limitations of space or time, these limitations and any measures taken by the trader to make the information available to consumers by other means shall be taken into account in deciding whether information has been omitted. 4.

            <p>The dispute in the main proceedings concerns the advertisement published on 2 December 2012 in the weekly Bild am Sonntag at the request of DHL Paket. That advertisement presented five different products, which it was possible to purchase through that undertaking's sales platform. A reader who was interested by one of those products was invited to visit that platform and enter the code corresponding to the product on it, that code being referred to in the advertisement. He was then transferred to the site of the product concerned where the identity of the commercial seller of that product was mentioned. Under the heading `Supplier information', the reader could also find details of the trading name and geographical address of his contracting partner. Finally, it was stated in that advertisement that the platform in question enabled interested persons to have access to over 5 million products and more than 2500 traders.</p>

          <content eId="para_4540__content">
            <p>According to the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice), the present dispute hinges on the question whether the information regarding the geographical address and identity of the trader, as referred to in Article 7(4)(b) of Directive 2005/29, must be in the printed advertisement for specific products, if consumers are able to obtain the advertised products exclusively via a website of the undertaking advertising those products, which is referred to in the advertisement, and if consumers can obtain such information easily on or via that website.</p>

          <num>14</num>
          <content eId="para_4541__content">
            <p>The referring court observes that the advertisement at issue in the main proceedings could constitute an invitation to purchase, within the meaning of Article 2(i) of Directive 2005/29, on which the information legally required by Article 7(4)(b) of that directive must be included.</p>
          </content>

        <paragraph eId="para_4542">
          <num>15</num>
          <content eId="para_4542__content">
            <p>It notes that a material item of information, within the meaning of Article 7(4) of Directive 2005/29, is provided in a timely manner to a consumer only if he receives it before he is able to make a transactional decision on the basis of an invitation to purchase. In a case such as that at issue in the main proceedings, the transactional decision consists in consulting the sales website in order to purchase a product advertised there or in order to study that product more closely. These circumstances suggest that the information as to the identity and geographical address of the seller of the advertised products must appear in the advertisement itself.</p>

        <paragraph eId="para_4543">
          <num>16</num>
          <content eId="para_4543__content">
            <p>Nevertheless, the referring court takes the view that the case-law of the Court of Justice is not sufficiently clear as regards whether, in the case of a printed advertisement intended to persuade people to visit an online selling portal, the information required under Article 7(4)(b) of Directive 2005/29 must appear in the printed advertisement itself.</p>

          <content eId="para_4544__content">
            <p>The referring court observes that, as with a visit to a physical shop, visiting a website is directly linked to the purchase of the products offered there. Moreover, the information relating to the other contracting party, provided for in Article 7(4)(b) of Directive 2005/29, is material for the consumer's transactional decision since it enables him to assess the undertaking's reputation as regards the quality and reliability of the products or services it offers and also its economic strength, creditworthiness and liability.</p>

        </paragraph>
        <paragraph eId="para_4545">
          <num>18</num>
          <content eId="para_4545__content">
            <p>The referring court explains that the fact that a print advertisement does not mention any information relating to the seller's trading name may lead a consumer to consult the website, even if he would probably have refrained from examining the offer in the advertisement more closely had he known of the identity of the undertaking behind the offer, for example in the situation where that undertaking has negative ratings on rating websites or if the consumer has previously had negative experiences of that undertaking.</p>

          <num>19</num>
          <content eId="para_4546__content">
            <p>According to the referring court, it appears to be immaterial in this connection whether the customer is able to purchase the advertised products exclusively via the advertiser's website. Admittedly, the information provided at that stage still reaches the consumer prior to the moment when the transaction takes place or is accessible before that moment. However, that happens too late to enable him to make an informed decision as to whether he should look into the advertised products in more detail, and, to that end, visit that website. In addition, the fact that a consumer on a computer can order products in peace and unobserved by sales staff does not alter the fact that he does not have the material information regarding the geographical address and identity of the seller of the advertised products before he visits the advertiser's website.</p>

        <paragraph eId="para_4547">
          <num>20</num>
          <content eId="para_4547__content">
            <p>Consequently, according to the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice), the objective pursued by Article 7(4) of Directive 2005/29 suggests that DHL Paket should have included the identity and the geographical address of the sellers of the products on the advertisement at issue.</p>

          <content eId="para_4548__content">
            <p>The referring court nevertheless points out that, under Article 7(3) of Directive 2005/29, limitations of space or time imposed by commercial practice must be taken into account in deciding whether information has been omitted. In the opinion of the referring court, there are no such limitations in the case in the main proceedings. In addition, that provision also requires, if appropriate, that account be taken of any measures taken by the defendant in the main proceedings to make the information available to consumers by other means.</p>

          <content eId="para_4549__content">
            <p>The referring court lastly raises the issue of if it is important, in order to examine the scope of the obligations stemming from Article 7(4) of Directive 2005/29, whether the undertaking advertises the sale of its own products in a print medium and refers directly to its own website for the information required, or whether the advertisement relates to products which are sold by other companies on the advertiser's website, and consumers obtain the information required by Article 7(4) of the directive only through one or more further steps (clicks) via links to the websites of those other undertakings which are made available only on the website of the operators of the sales platform, which is the only website given in the advertisement.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances the Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling: `</p>

                <p>Must the information concerning the geographical address and identity of the trader, within the meaning of Article 7(4)(b) of Directive 2005/29, appear in advertising material for specific products which appears in a print medium, even if consumers obtain the advertised products exclusively via a website of the undertaking advertising the products, and which is indicated in the advertisement, and consumers can easily obtain the information required by Article 7(4) of the directive on or via that website?</p>

              <item>
                <num>(2)</num>
                <p>Does the answer to Question 1 depend on whether the undertaking advertising in the print medium is advertising sales of its own products and refers directly to its own website for the information required by Article 7(4) of Directive 2005/29, or whether the advertising relates to products which are sold by other undertakings on an internet platform operated by the advertiser, and consumers are able to access the information set out in Article 7(4) of the directive only through one or more steps (clicks) via links to the websites of those other undertakings which are made available only on the website specified in the advertisement, namely that of the operator of the sales platform?'</p>

            <p>By its two questions, which should be examined together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 7(4)(b) of Directive 2005/29 must be interpreted as meaning that the information relating to the geographical address and the identity of the trader must be included in an advertisement for specific products, in a print medium, where those products are purchased by consumers via the website, given in the advertisement, of the undertaking which is the author of that advertisement and that information is readily accessible on or via that website.</p>

            <p>Secondly, it must be recalled that, under Article 7(4)(b) of Directive 2005/29, the geographical address and the identity of the trader, such as his trading name and, where applicable, the geographical address and the identity of the trader on whose behalf he is acting constitute material information. However, that provision must be read in conjunction with Article 7(1) of that directive, according to which the commercial practice at issue must be assessed having regard, inter alia, to its factual context and the limitations of the medium of communication used (judgment of 12 May 2011, Ving Sverige, Câ€‘122/10, EU:C:2011:299, paragraph 53).</p>

          <content eId="para_4554__content">
            <p>Moreover, under Article 7(3) of Directive 2005/29, account is to be taken, in deciding whether information has been omitted, of the limitations of space and time of the medium of communication used and of the measures taken by the trader to make that information available to consumers by other means (judgment of 12 May 2011, Ving Sverige, Câ€‘122/10, EU:C:2011:299, paragraph 54).</p>

          <content eId="para_4555__content">
            <p>It follows that the extent of the information relating to the geographical address and the identity of the trader which has to be communicated, by a trader, in an invitation to purchase, must be assessed on the basis of the context of that invitation, the nature and characteristics of the product and the medium of communication used (judgment of 12 May 2011, Ving Sverige, Câ€‘122/10, EU:C:2011:299, paragraph 55).</p>

            <p>Where an online sales platform is advertised in a print medium and where, in particular, a large number of sales options offered by various traders are presented in that advertisement, there may be limitations of space within the meaning of Article 7(3) of Directive 2005/29.</p>

            <p>It follows from all the foregoing that, although the information on the geographical address and identity of the trader, referred to in Article 7(4)(b) of Directive 2005/29, must in principle be included in the invitation to purchase, that need not necessarily be the case where the means of communication used for the purposes of the commercial practice imposes limitations of space, in so far as the consumers who may purchase the products advertised via the website, mentioned in the advertisement, of the undertaking advertising those products may easily obtain that information on or via that website. It is for the national court to assess, on a case-by-case basis, whether that condition is fulfilled, taking into consideration the context of the invitation to purchase and the means of communication used.</p>

          <content eId="para_4558__content">
            <p>Lastly, it must be stated that the obligation to include in an invitation to purchase the information referred to in Article 7(4)(b) of Directive 2005/29 does not depend on the issue of whether the supplier of the products concerned is the author of that invitation or a third party. Consequently, where an advertisement in a print medium promotes products from different suppliers, the information required by that provision remains necessary, subject to the limitations of space mentioned in paragraph 29 above.</p>

            <p>It is for the referring court to examine, on a case-by-case basis, first, whether the limitations of space in the advertisement warrant information on the supplier being provided only upon access to the online sales platform and, secondly, whether, so far as the online sales platform is concerned, the information required by Article 7(4)(b) of Directive 2005/29 is communicated simply and quickly.</p>

            <p>Having regard to the foregoing considerations, the answer to the two questions is that Article 7(4)(b) of Directive 2005/29 must be interpreted as meaning that an advertisement, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which falls within the definition of an `invitation to purchase' within the meaning of that directive, may satisfy the obligation regarding information laid down in that provision. It is for the referring court to examine, on a case-by-case basis, first, whether the limitations of space in the advertisement warrant information on the supplier being provided only upon access to the online sales platform and, secondly, whether, so far as the online sales platform is concerned, the information required by Article 7(4)(b) of that directive is communicated simply and quickly.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Tenth Chamber) hereby rules: Article 7(4)(b) of Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council must be interpreted as meaning that an advertisement, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which falls within the definition of an `invitation to purchase' within the meaning of that directive, may satisfy the obligation regarding information laid down in that provision. It is for the referring court to examine, on a case-by-case basis, first, whether the limitations of space in the advertisement warrant information on the supplier being provided only upon access to the online sales platform and, secondly, whether, so far as the online sales platform is concerned, the information required by Article 7(4)(b) of that directive is communicated simply and quickly.</p>
