            <p>In calculating Mrs Zaniewicz-Dybeck's guaranteed pension in accordance with national provisions, the National Insurance Fund determined the basis of calculation of that pension by carrying out a pro rata calculation, in accordance with Paragraph 25 of Chapter 67 SFB and the instructions. Moreover, when calculating the basic amount for the purpose of Article 46(2)(a) of Regulation No 1408/71, it did not take account of the income-based retirement pension acquired by Mrs Zaniewicz-Dybeck in Poland, but attributed to the income-based pension acquired by her in Sweden, amounting to SEK 75216 (approximately EUR 7897) for 24 insurance years, an annual value of SEK 3134 (approximately EUR 329), that is, SEK 75216 divided by 24, then multiplied that amount by the maximum insurance period for the guaranteed pension, namely 40 years. She thus obtained a fictitious pension value of SEK 125360 (approximately EUR 13162).</p>

            <p>According to the Pensions Authority, which, on 1 January 2010, replaced the National Insurance Fund, insurance periods completed in a Member State other than the Kingdom of Sweden give rise to entitlement to a pension from that other Member State. However, as the guaranteed pension is complementary in nature, the effect of calculating that pension without applying Article 47(1)(d) of Regulation No 1408/71 would be that any person concerned who has completed insurance periods in a Member State other than the Kingdom of Sweden would be overcompensated. If an average pension value were not attributed to insurance periods completed in a Member State other than the Kingdom of Sweden, that would result in those periods being given a lower value than the corresponding value for the same periods completed in the Kingdom of Sweden.</p>

If the person concerned worked during that period and, as a consequence, was entitled to a pension with a value greater than that of the fictitious pension calculated by the competent institution, he will be placed in an advantageous position.

            <p>For the purpose of providing a useful answer to the national court, it should be noted, first, that Regulation No 1408/71 does not set up a common scheme of social security, but allows different national social security schemes to exist, its sole objective being to ensure the coordination of those schemes. Thus, according to settled case-law, Member States retain the power to organise their own social security schemes (see, inter alia, judgment of 21 February 2013, Salgado González, C‑282/11, EU:C:2013:86, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).</p>

The competent institution is then required, pursuant to Article 46(2)(b) of the regulation, to determine the actual amount of the benefit on the basis of the theoretical amount, in accordance with the ratio of the duration of the periods of insurance and/or residence completed in the Member State of the competent institution to the total duration of the periods of insurance and/or residence completed in the various Member States -- in other words, the pro rata method of calculation.</p>

Second, when carrying out the pro rata calculation required under Article 46(2) of the regulation, the competent institution, following the instructions, did not take account of the retirement pensions received by Mrs Zaniewicz-Dybeck in Poland but, as provided for in Article 47(1)(d) of the regulation, attributed an annual value to the income-based pension acquired by her in Sweden and then multiplied that amount by the maximum insurance period for the guaranteed pension, namely 40 years.

Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fifth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Regulation (EEC) No 1408/71 of the Council of 14 June 1971 on the application of social security schemes to employed persons, to self-employed persons and to members of their families moving within the Community, as amended and updated by Council Regulation (EC) No 118/97 of 2 December 1996, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1606/98 of 29 June 1998, is to be interpreted as meaning that, when the competent institution of a Member State calculates a minimum benefit, such as the guaranteed pension at issue in the main proceedings, it is not inappropriate to apply Article 46(2) or Article 47(1)(d) of the regulation. Such a benefit must be calculated in accordance with Article 50 of the regulation, in conjunction with the provisions of national law, without, however, applying national provisions, such as those in the main proceedings, providing for a pro rata calculation. 2. Regulation No 1408/71, as amended and updated by Regulation No 118/97, as amended by Regulation No 1606/98, and in particular Article 50 of that regulation, is to be interpreted as not precluding the legislation of a Member State under which, when calculating a minimum benefit such as the guaranteed pension at issue in the main proceedings, the competent institution must take account of all the retirement pensions which the person concerned actually receives from one or more other Member States.</p>
