            <p>AY, a Hungarian national and chairman of the board of directors of a Hungarian company, was indicted in Croatia on 31 March 2014 on charges of active corruption. In the indictment issued by the Ured za suzbijanje korupcije i organiziranog kriminaliteta (Office for Suppression of Corruption and Organised Crime, Croatia), AY is alleged to have arranged for a considerable amount of money to be paid to a high-ranking Croatian politician, in return for the conclusion of an agreement.</p>

            <p>The investigation against AY was opened in Croatia on 10 June 2011. On the adoption of the decision to proceed with that investigation, the competent Hungarian authority was requested to provide international legal assistance by interviewing AY as a suspect and delivering a summons to him.</p>

            <p>The Croatian authorities repeated the request several times by letters rogatory. However, no action was taken on that request by Hungary, on the ground that the execution of the request would have affected Hungarian national interests. Consequently, the Croatian investigation was suspended in December 2012.</p>

            <p>However, on the basis of the information communicated by the Croatian authorities, the Hungarian Attorney General opened, on 14 July 2011, an investigation, as there were reasonable grounds to suspect that a criminal offence consisting of acts of active corruption at international level under the Hungarian Criminal Code had been committed. The referring court states that the investigation was terminated by decision of the Hungarian National Bureau of Investigation of 20 January 2012 on the ground that the acts committed did not constitute a criminal offence under Hungarian law.</p>

            <p>The execution of that EAW was refused by decision of the Fővárosi Törvényszék (Budapest High Court, Hungary) of 7 October 2013 on the grounds that the available information showed that criminal proceedings had already been brought in Hungary in respect of the same acts as those on which the EAW was based and those proceedings had been halted.</p>

            <p>Following the refusal to execute the EAW, AY was located in Germany and in Austria, but those two Member States indicated that they had decided not to take action on the international wanted persons notice issued through Interpol, as its execution could constitute an infringement of the principle ne bis in idem. Subsequently, the Interpol Secretariat decided to cancel the international wanted persons notice issued against AY and to deny the Republic of Croatia authorisation to use Interpol channels in connection with AY on account of the existence of a risk of infringement of the principle ne bis in idem and for the reasons of national security put forward by Hungary.</p>

            <p>On 27 January 2017, the referring court submitted the EAW again to the competent Hungarian judicial authority. The referring court stated in that regard that, criminal proceedings against AY having been brought before it and the EAW having initially been issued by the Public Prosecutor's Office during the phase prior to the initiation of those proceedings, circumstances had changed in the issuing Member State.</p>

            <p>Given that, after the second EAW was sent, no answer had been received after 60 days, the referring court approached the Croatian member of Eurojust. That court states that, after intervening, that member forwarded to that court the opinion of the competent Hungarian authority, which states that the authority did not consider itself obliged to act on the EAW that was issued, on which a decision had already been taken in the course of the pre-trial phase of the criminal proceedings in Croatia. It therefore considered that it was also not obliged to observe the time limits for processing a European arrest warrant laid down in Framework Decision 2002/584. In addition, the opinion stated that there are no legal means in Hungary to authorise AY's arrest or to initiate a new procedure for the execution of the second EAW issued in Croatia on 15 December 2015. An identical opinion from the competent Hungarian authority was forwarded to the referring court on 4 April 2017.</p>

            <p>In that context, the referring court states that it has doubts as to the interpretation of the grounds for non-execution laid down in Article 3(2) and Article 4(3) of Framework Decision 2002/584. That court is of the opinion that it is the requested person that is the subject of the EAW, as a decision relied on as a ground for the refusal to execute the EAW must relate to the requested person in his capacity as a suspect or an accused. Where the requested person has been interviewed as a witness during the proceedings in which the decision was given, that decision cannot form the basis for a refusal to execute the EAW. As a result, a decision terminating an investigation in Hungary which was not directed against AY cannot form the basis for a refusal to surrender that person.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be borne in mind that, according to the Court's settled case-law, in the context of the cooperation between the Court and the national courts provided for in Article 267 TFEU, it is solely for the national court, before which the dispute has been brought and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine in the light of the particular circumstances of the case both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court. Consequently, where the questions submitted concern the interpretation of EU law, the Court is, in principle, bound to give a ruling (judgment of 12 October 2017, Sleutjes, C‑278/16, EU:C:2017:757, paragraph 21 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It follows that questions on the interpretation of EU law referred by a national court in the factual and legislative context which that court is responsible for defining and the accuracy of which is not a matter for this Court to determine, enjoy a presumption of relevance. The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought is unrelated to the actual facts of the main action or its object, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgment of 12 October 2017, Sleutjes, C‑278/16, EU:C:2017:757, paragraph 22 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is not obvious from the case file submitted to the Court that the facts of the case correspond to one of those situations. Two separate sets of proceedings concerning AY are currently pending before the referring court, namely criminal proceedings in default before the adjudicating chamber of that court, and proceedings concerning the issue of an EAW before the competent chamber in those matters. The questions referred for a preliminary ruling have been done so in the context of the latter proceedings.</p>

            <p>In any event, the admissibility of the request for a preliminary ruling is not called into question by the fact that the questions asked concern the obligations of the executing judicial authority, even though the referring court is the judicial authority that issued the EAW. The issue of an EAW could result in the arrest of the requested person and, therefore, affects the personal freedom of the latter. The Court has held that, with regard to proceedings relating to an EAW, observance of fundamental rights falls primarily within the responsibility of the issuing Member State (judgment of 23 January 2018, Piotrowski, C‑367/16, EU:C:2018:27, paragraph 50).</p>

            <p>As is apparent from the wording of Article 1(2) of Framework Decision 2002/584, Member States are required to execute any EAW on the basis of the principle of mutual recognition and in accordance with the provisions of that framework decision. Except in exceptional circumstances, the executing judicial authorities may therefore refuse to execute such a warrant only in the exhaustively listed cases of non-execution provided for by the framework decision and the execution of the EAW may be made subject only to one of the conditions listed exhaustively therein. Thus, the framework decision explicitly states the grounds for mandatory (Article 3) and optional (Articles 4 and 4a) non-execution of the EAW (see judgment of 10 August 2017, Tupikas, C‑270/17 PPU, EU:C:2017:628, paragraphs 50 and 51).</p>

Furthermore, Article 17(1) and (6) of the framework decision provides that `[an EAW] shall be dealt with and executed as a matter of urgency' and that `reasons must be given for any refusal to execute [such a warrant]'. In addition, Article 22 of the framework decision provides that `the executing judicial authority shall notify the issuing judicial authority immediately of the decision on the action to be taken on the [EAW]'.</p>

According to that provision, `extradition may be refused if the competent authorities of the requested Party have decided either not to institute or to terminate proceedings in respect of the same offence or offences'. In that regard, the explanatory report to the Convention states that the provision covers the case of a person `in regard to whom' a decision has been taken precluding proceedings or terminating them (see page 9 of the Explanatory Report to the European Convention on Extradition (Paris, 13.

            <p>Lastly, pursuant to the third ground for non-execution laid down in Article 4(3) of Framework Decision 2002/584, the executing judicial authority may refuse to execute the EAW where a final judgment has been passed upon the requested person in a Member State, in respect of the same acts, which prevents further proceedings.</p>

            <p>Consequently, having regard to all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first to fourth questions is that Article 3(2) and Article 4(3) of Framework Decision 2002/584 must be interpreted as meaning that a decision of the Public Prosecutor's Office, such as that of the Hungarian National Bureau of Investigation in question in the main proceedings, which terminated an investigation opened against an unknown person, during which the person who is the subject of the EAW was interviewed as a witness only, without criminal proceedings having been brought against that person and where the decision was not taken in respect of that person, cannot be relied on for the purpose of refusing to execute that EAW pursuant to either of those provisions.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fifth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 1(2) of Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA of 13 June 2002 on the European arrest warrant and the surrender procedures between Member States, as amended by Council Framework Decision 2009/299/JHA of 26 February 2009, must be interpreted as requiring the judicial authority of the executing Member State to adopt a decision on any European arrest warrant forwarded to it, even when, in that Member State, a ruling has already been made on a previous European arrest warrant concerning the same person and the same acts, but the second European arrest warrant has been issued only on account of the indictment, in the issuing Member State, of the requested person. 2. Article 3(2) and Article 4(3) of Framework Decision 2002/584, as amended by Framework Decision 2009/299, must be interpreted as meaning that a decision of the Public Prosecutor's Office, such as that of the Hungarian National Bureau of Investigation in question in the main proceedings, which terminated an investigation opened against an unknown person, during which the person who is the subject of the European arrest warrant was interviewed as a witness only, without criminal proceedings having been brought against that person and where the decision was not taken in respect of that person, cannot be relied on for the purpose of refusing to execute that European arrest warrant pursuant to either of those provisions.</p>
