            <p>Under paragraph 2 of Schedule 6 of the 1994 Act, adopted on the basis of that decision, and the individual notice, Avon's taxable amount for VAT purposes corresponds to the sale value at the stage of final consumption of the goods supplied by it to non-taxable persons. In other words, under that system the VAT on the products sold by Avon to the representatives is calculated on the basis not of the price excluding tax at which Avon sells them those products, but of the price at which the representatives are deemed to resell them to their customers, that excess VAT being borne by Avon. However, in practice the Commissioners make two adjustments to that calculation in order to take account of the fact that some products are purchased by non-taxable representatives for their personal use and that the latter sell some products at a discount.</p>

            <p>Avon brought proceedings before the referring tribunal for the refund of overpaid VAT totalling in the region of GBP 14 million (approximately EUR 15792000) on the ground that the system of taxation which is applicable to it, on the basis of the individual notice, does not take into account the tax relating to the cost of the representatives' purchase of demonstration items, which are intended to help them to increase their sale volumes and are sold to them by it at a discount greater than that applied to the other products. According to Avon, as purchases of the demonstration items amount to business expenditure, the VAT relating to those purchases would have been deductible by those representatives if they had possessed the status of taxable person.</p>

            <p>Consequently, the individual notice is said to go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve the objective pursued and involves the overpayment of VAT because of the absence of an adjustment to take account of the VAT incurred by the representatives on the purchase of demonstration items. There is thus a breach of the principles of proportionality, equal treatment and fiscal neutrality, and also a competitive disadvantage between Avon and economic operators using traditional selling methods, who do not bear that VAT burden.</p>

            <p>Avon also submits that, in its application to the Commission for a derogation, the United Kingdom failed to provide all relevant information for the purposes of Article 27(2) of the Sixth Directive, although the problem of disparity of treatment regarding VAT applicable to demonstration items was already known. Accordingly, the purpose of its claim before the referring tribunal is that the VAT payable should be adjusted to take account of the VAT applicable to those demonstration items or, in the alternative, that Decision 89/534, paragraph 2 of Schedule 6 of the 1994 Act and the individual notice should be declared invalid.</p>

            <p>The Commissioners note that that provision is intended to prevent a loss of revenue on sales which escape VAT on their retail price. They take the view that the failure to take account of the VAT paid by the representatives in respect of the purchase of the demonstration items does not offend against the principles of proportionality, equal treatment and neutrality and does not create a distortion of competition, since Avon has chosen an operating structure and an approach to the market that are different from those of traditional retailers and Avon and those retailers operate in different markets, even though the products sold are similar. Those circumstances justify a different tax treatment.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, in the Commissioners' submission, the calculation and levying of VAT should not be complicated unnecessarily for taxpayers or tax authorities. Acceptance of Avon's arguments would make the non-taxable representatives bear a significant administrative burden.</p>

            <p>The Commissioners contend that they cannot interpret paragraph 2 of Schedule 6 of the 1994 Act as meaning that Avon might deduct the VAT paid by the representatives in respect of the purchase of the demonstration items without going beyond the authorisation given by the Council, its own legislation and the principle that an exception to the normal VAT mechanism must be interpreted narrowly.</p>

            <p>By interlocutory decision of 19 February 2014, the referring tribunal held that the terms in which Decision 89/534 is couched, reproduced in paragraph 2 of Schedule 6 of the 1994 Act, do not permit account to be taken of the tax paid by the representatives in respect of the purchase of the demonstration items, thereby giving rise to `sticking' tax, that is to say, input tax paid that cannot be recovered. It inferred from this that that provision creates unfair competition between Avon and entities which sell through taxable retailers. Therefore, paragraph 2 of Schedule 6 of the 1994 Act goes further than is necessary in order to achieve its objective of preventing any tax avoidance.</p>

            <p>As regards the validity of Decision 89/534, first, it should be noted that, in order for an EU measure relating to the VAT system to be compatible with the principle of proportionality, the provisions which it contains must be considered to be appropriate and necessary for the attainment of the objectives which it pursues and to be such as to affect as little as possible the objectives and principles of the Sixth Directive (see, to that effect, judgments of 19 September 2000, Ampafrance and Sanofi, C‑177/99 and C‑181/99, EU:C:2000:470, paragraph 60, and of 29 April 2004, Sudholz, C‑17/01, EU:C:2004:242, paragraph 46).</p>

            <p>In the present instance, the derogating measure in Decision 89/534 pursues, in accordance with the second to fourth recitals of that decision, the objective of preventing tax avoidance and is intended to enable the United Kingdom to remedy certain specific problems caused by the direct selling system so far as concerns VAT. As there are non-taxable resellers at the final stage of the marketing chain, the consequence of that system is that the supplies by those resellers to the final consumer are not subject to VAT.</p>

            <p>The Court has held that the concept of `tax avoidance', within the meaning of Article 27(1) of the Sixth Directive, corresponds to a purely objective phenomenon and that that provision permits the adoption of a measure derogating from the basic rule set out in Article 11A(1)(a) of that directive even where the taxable person carries on business not with any intention of obtaining a tax advantage but for commercial reasons (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 July 1988, Direct Cosmetics and Laughtons Photographs, 138/86 and 139/86, EU:C:1988:383, paragraphs 21 and 24).</p>

            <p>Inasmuch as the derogating measure in Decision 89/534 authorises the United Kingdom to charge VAT on sales of a direct sales company's products to final consumers made by non-taxable resellers, by determining the taxable amount of that company in the light of the open market value of the goods sold by those resellers, it enables the loss of tax revenue resulting from such a marketing structure to be avoided. Such a measure therefore appears appropriate for attaining the objective of combating tax avoidance.</p>

            <p>The failure of Decision 89/534 to take account of the input VAT relating to demonstration items purchased by non-taxable resellers from a direct sales company, such as Avon in the main proceedings, results in the distribution chain of that company's products bearing a greater VAT burden than its competitors' products.

The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred for a preliminary ruling by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgment of 14 June 2017, Santogal M-Comércio e Reparação de Automóveis, C‑26/16, EU:C:2017:453, paragraph 31 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_5322__content">
            <p>In that context, it should first of all be noted that the fact that non-taxable resellers incur VAT on purchases of demonstration items from a direct sales company, such as Avon in the main proceedings, without being able to deduct it, does not appear to be information which, as such, relates to the objective pursued by the derogation requested or to the fundamental mechanism of the derogation, namely the determination of the value of the taxable amount.</p>

            <p>Next, it is clear that that fact is inherent in the VAT system since, as has already been stated in paragraphs 42 and 48 of the present judgment, resellers not subject to VAT cannot exercise a right to deduct the tax that they are charged. Thus, the view cannot be taken that such a fact should have been notified to the Commission together with the application for a derogation that the United Kingdom sent it.</p>

Examination of the first question has disclosed no factor of such a kind as to affect the validity of Decision 89/534. 3.
