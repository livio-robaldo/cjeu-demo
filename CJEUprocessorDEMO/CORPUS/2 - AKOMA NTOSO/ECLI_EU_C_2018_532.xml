                <p>On 29 November 2000 the Council, in accordance with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council, adopted the programme of measures to implement the principle of mutual recognition of decisions in criminal matters, which provides for the ``adoption of one or more instruments establishing the principle that a court in one Member State must be able to take account of final criminal judgments rendered by the courts in other Member States for the purposes of assessing the offender's criminal record and establishing whether he has reoffended, and in order to determine the type of sentence applicable and the arrangements for enforcing it ''. ...</p>

                    <p>The principle that the Member States should attach to a conviction handed down in other Member States effects equivalent to those attached to a conviction handed down by their own courts in accordance with national law should be affirmed, whether those effects be regarded by national law as matters of fact or of procedural or substantive law. However, this Framework Decision does not seek to harmonise the consequences attached by the different national legislations to the existence of previous convictions, and the obligation to take into account previous convictions handed down in other Member States exists only to the extent that previous national convictions are taken into account under national law.</p>

                    <p>In contrast to other instruments, this Framework Decision does not aim at the execution in one Member State of judicial decisions taken in other Member States, but rather aims at enabling consequences to be attached to a previous conviction handed down in one Member State in the course of new criminal proceedings in another Member State to the extent that such consequences are attached to previous national convictions under the law of that other Member State. Therefore this Framework Decision contains no obligation to take into account such previous convictions, for example, in cases where the information obtained under applicable instruments is not sufficient, where a national conviction would not have been possible regarding the act for which the previous conviction had been imposed or where the previously imposed sanction is unknown to the national legal system.</p>

                <p>This Framework Decision respects the variety of domestic solutions and procedures required for taking into account a previous conviction handed down in another Member State. The exclusion of a possibility to review a previous conviction should not prevent a Member State from issuing a decision, if necessary, in order to attach the equivalent legal effects to such previous conviction. However, the procedures involved in issuing such a decision should not, in view of the time and procedures or formalities required, render it impossible to attach equivalent effects to a previous conviction handed down in another Member State.'</p>

It therefore considers that the special procedure for recognition appears to operate as if it were new criminal proceedings against the defendant for the same offences.</p>

                <p>Must Articles 67 and 82 TFEU be interpreted as precluding a criminal procedure or other national procedure, governed by national legislation, the purpose of which is the ``recognition '' or application in a Member State of the validity of a foreign judgment (resulting in the foreign judgment being regarded as having been delivered by a national court), in relation to a defendant in a criminal case in which a final and definitive judgment has already been given by a national court of another Member State of the European Union?</p>

                <p>26 By its first question, the referring court asks essentially whether Framework Decision 2008/675, read in the light of Article 82 TFEU, must be interpreted as precluding the taking into account in a Member State, in new criminal proceedings brought against a person, of a final judgment previously handed down by a court of another Member State convicting that person of other offences being conditional on a special procedure for prior recognition, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, by the courts of the first Member State.</p>

          <content eId="para_15795__content">
            <p>It must be noted, to begin with, that Article 1(1) of Framework Decision 2008/675 provides that the purpose of the framework decision is to determine the conditions under which previous convictions handed down in one Member State against a person are taken into account in the course of new criminal proceedings brought in another Member State against the same person for different facts (judgment of 21 September 2017, Beshkov, C‑171/16, EU:C:2017:710, paragraph 25).</p>

          <num>28</num>
          <content eId="para_15796__content">
            <p>To that end, Article 3(1) of Framework Decision 2008/675, read in the light of recital 5, obliges Member States to ensure that, when such criminal proceedings are brought, previous convictions handed down in other Member States, in respect of which information has been obtained under applicable instruments on mutual legal assistance or on the exchange of information extracted from criminal records, are taken into account to the extent that previous national convictions are taken into account under national law, and that the legal effects attached to them are equivalent to those attached to previous national convictions, in accordance with national law, whether in relation to questions of fact or questions of substantive or procedural law (judgment of 21 September 2017, Beshkov, C‑171/16, EU:C:2017:710, paragraph 26).</p>

          <content eId="para_15797__content">
            <p>Article 3(2) of the framework decision states that that obligation is to apply at the pre-trial stage, at the trial stage itself and at the time of execution of the conviction, in particular with regard to the applicable rules of procedure, including the rules relating to the definition of the offence, the type and level of the sentence, and the rules governing the execution of the decision. Thus recitals 2 and 7 of the framework decision state that a national court must be able to take account of convictions handed down in other Member States, including for the purpose of determining what arrangements for enforcement may be implemented, and that the effects of those convictions should be equivalent to the effects of national decisions at each of those procedural stages (judgment of 21 September 2017, Beshkov, C‑171/16, EU:C:2017:710, paragraph 27).</p>

            <p>It follows from the above, in particular, that the framework decision is directed in principle to situations in which new criminal proceedings have been brought against a person previously convicted in another Member State. That concept of `new criminal proceedings' covers the pre-trial stage, the trial stage itself and the execution of the conviction.</p>

            <p>In the main proceedings, according to the documents before the Court, Mr Lada is not the subject of new criminal proceedings in Hungary in the sense described in the preceding paragraph, in which the question could arise for the national court concerned of taking into account the decision of the Austrian court.</p>

            <p>However, as the Advocate General, too, observes in point 73 of his Opinion, it appears from the order for reference that, for the Hungarian authorities, the special procedure for recognition of a foreign judgment, laid down in Paragraphs 46 to 48 of the Law on international judicial assistance in criminal matters, forms a necessary preliminary stage to the taking into account in new criminal proceedings brought against a person in Hungary of a previous conviction of that person for other offences by a court of another Member State. Thus, since the special procedure for recognition is necessary for the taking into account of a person's foreign criminal convictions in the event of new criminal proceedings being brought against that person, the special procedure for recognition appears to be inseparably linked to the implementation of Framework Decision 2008/675.</p>

            <p>Consequently, in order to provide the referring court with an answer of use to it, the interpretation of Framework Decision 2008/675 is relevant for ascertaining whether or not a special procedure for recognition of a foreign judgment, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, renders that framework decision ineffective.</p>

            <p>According to the order for reference and the documents before the Court, Paragraphs 46 to 48 of the Law on international judicial assistance in criminal matters establish a special preliminary procedure for recognition by the competent Hungarian courts of final convictions handed down by foreign courts, with the object of conferring on the decision recognising those convictions the effect of a criminal conviction by a Hungarian court.</p>

            <p>That procedure, according to the referring court, involves an examination of the foreign conviction in order to ascertain, in a first stage, in particular whether fundamental rights have been observed in the foreign proceedings. Next, as noted in paragraph 18 above, the competent court must, if necessary, reclassify the offence in accordance with the Hungarian Criminal Code in force at the time of the offence and alter the type or level of the sentence or measure imposed by the court of the other Member State if it is not entirely compatible with that provided for in Hungarian law.</p>

            <p>As the Advocate General observes in point 75 of his Opinion, Framework Decision 2008/675 contributes to strengthening mutual trust within the European area of justice, in that it encourages a judicial culture in which previous convictions handed down in another Member State are in principle taken into account.</p>

            <p>In this respect, it must be noted that a special procedure for recognition laid down by a Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which, with respect to a previous conviction handed down by a court of another Member State, imposes an obligation to ascertain whether that court observed the fundamental rights of the person concerned is liable, in the absence of exceptional circumstances, to call in question the principle of mutual trust and hence one of the objectives of Framework Decision 2008/675 (see, to that effect, Opinion 2/13 (Accession of the EU to the ECHR) of 18 December 2014, EU:C:2014:2454, paragraph 191, and judgment of 5 April 2016, Aranyosi and Căldăraru, C‑404/15 and C‑659/15 PPU, EU:C:2016:198, paragraph 78).</p>

          <content eId="para_15806__content">
            <p>More particularly, that framework decision, as recital 2 states, aims to implement the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and judicial decisions in criminal matters, enshrined in Article 82(1) TFEU, which replaced Article 31 TEU, on the basis of which the framework decision was adopted. That principle precludes the taking into account, in the context of that framework decision, of a previous conviction by a court in another Member State being conditional on the implementation of a national procedure for prior recognition, and precludes that conviction being reviewed in that procedure (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 September 2017, Beshkov, C‑171/16, EU:C:2017:710, paragraph 36 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_15807__content">
            <p>Article 3(3) of Framework Decision 2008/675 thus expressly proscribes any review such as that at issue in the main proceedings, since previous convictions in other Member States must be taken into account in the terms in which they were handed down (see, by analogy, judgment of 21 September 2017, Beshkov, C‑171/16, EU:C:2017:710, paragraph 37).</p>

          <content eId="para_15808__content">
            <p>That being so, even though Framework Decision 2008/675 precludes a review such as that at issue in the main proceedings that may lead to a reclassification of the criminal offence and an alteration of the sentence imposed in another Member State, it must be stated that the framework decision does not prevent the Member State in which the new criminal proceedings take place from being able to lay down rules for taking into account previous convictions handed down in that other Member State, since the sole purpose of laying down such rules is to determine whether it is possible to attach to those convictions legal effects equivalent to those that attach to previous national convictions in accordance with national law.</p>

          <content eId="para_15809__content">
            <p>That conclusion is borne out by recital 13 of the framework decision, which states that the fact that it is not possible to review a previous conviction should not prevent a Member State from issuing a decision, if necessary, in order to attach the equivalent legal effects to that previous conviction.</p>

            <p>As appears from recital 5 of the framework decision, it `does not seek to harmonise the consequences attached by the different national legislations to the existence of previous convictions, and the obligation to take into account previous convictions handed down in other Member States exists only to the extent that previous national convictions are taken into account under national law'.</p>

          <content eId="para_15811__content">
            <p>Recital 6 of the framework decision states in this respect that it `contains no obligation to take into account such previous convictions, for example, in cases where the information obtained under applicable instruments is not sufficient, where a national conviction would not have been possible regarding the act for which the previous conviction had been imposed or where the previously imposed sanction is unknown to the national legal system'.</p>

            <p>So, although the framework decision does not prevent a Member State from taking a decision, if necessary, in order to attach equivalent legal effects to a previous conviction handed down in another Member State, the adoption of such a decision cannot, however, in any event involve the implementation of a national special procedure for prior recognition such as that at issue in the main proceedings (see, by analogy, judgment of 21 September 2017, Beshkov, C‑171/16, EU:C:2017:710, paragraph 38).</p>

            <p>Furthermore, as the Advocate General observes, in substance, in point 86 of his Opinion, the adoption of a decision enabling equivalent legal effects to be attached to a previous conviction in another Member State, such as that mentioned in recital 13 of Framework Decision 2008/675, requires an examination on a case-by-case basis in the light of a specific situation. That possibility cannot justify the implementation of a special procedure for recognition with respect to convictions handed down in another Member State which, first, is necessary for those convictions to be taken into account in new criminal proceedings and, second, is liable to lead to a reclassification of the offence committed and the sentence imposed.</p>

            <p>Moreover, in the judgment of 9 June 2016, Balogh ( C‑25/15, EU:C:2016:423, paragraphs 53 and 55), the Court previously held that Framework Decision 2009/315 and Decision 2009/316 must be interpreted as precluding the implementation of national legislation establishing a special procedure for recognition of foreign judgments, such as that provided for by Paragraphs 46 to 48 of the Hungarian Law on international judicial assistance in criminal matters, on the grounds in particular that such a procedure prior to the entry of those convictions in the criminal record, which, moreover, requires the transmission and translation of those judgments, is likely to delay that entry considerably, complicate the exchange of information between Member States, deprive the automatic translation system established by Decision 2009/316 of any effectiveness, and thus jeopardise the attainment of the objectives pursued by Framework Decision 2009/315 and Decision 2009/316.</p>

            <p>It should be observed here that Framework Decision 2009/315 and Framework Decision 2008/675 are inseparably linked. The competent authorities of the Member States must cooperate diligently and uniformly in exchanging information on criminal convictions, in order to avoid national judicial authorities before which new criminal proceedings are brought against persons who have previously been convicted of other offences by the courts of other Member States giving judgment without being able to take those previous convictions into account. National procedures liable to affect that diligent exchange of information thus clash both with Framework Decision 2009/315, read in conjunction with Decision 2009/316, and with Framework Decision 2008/675.</p>
