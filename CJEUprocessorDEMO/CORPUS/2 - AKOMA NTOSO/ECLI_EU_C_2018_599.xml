It shall also be regarded as a misleading omission when, taking account of the matters described in paragraph 1, a trader hides or provides in an unclear, unintelligible, ambiguous or untimely manner such material information as referred to in that paragraph or fails to identify the commercial intent of the commercial practice if not already apparent from the context, and where, in either case, this causes or is likely to cause the average consumer to take a transactional decision that he would not have taken otherwise. 3.

                <p>Information plays a key role in the operation of market forces and it is therefore necessary to introduce a uniform label for all products of the same type, to provide potential purchasers with supplementary standardised information on those products' costs in terms of energy and the consumption of other essential resources and to take measures to ensure that potential end-users who do not see the product displayed, and thus have no opportunity to see the label, are also supplied with this information. In order to be efficient and successful, the label should be easily recognisable to end-users, simple and concise. To this end the existing layout of the label should be retained as the basis to inform end-users about the energy efficiency of products. Energy consumption of and other information concerning the products should be measured in accordance with harmonised standards and methods.'</p>

            <p>Both Dyson and BSH place on the market vacuum cleaners which, in accordance with Delegated Regulation No 665/2013, must be labelled with an energy label when sold. That label reflects the results of tests which are carried out with an empty dust bag. Dyson criticises, inter alia, BSH for misleading consumers and claims that it is guilty of unfair commercial practices. It is in that context that Dyson brought an action before the referring court, the voorzitter van de rechtbank van koophandel te Antwerpen (President of the Commercial Court, Antwerp, Belgium).</p>

            <p>As a first step, the referring court rejects Dyson's claim that BSH carried out an unfair commercial practice by listing energy class A on the energy labels of the vacuum cleaners it markets. Such a classification is indeed the result of tests carried out with an empty dust bag, the referring court considering that test to be the only one enabling the annual energy consumption of vacuum cleaners to be assessed.</p>

To that end, the Court may have to reformulate the question referred to it (see, inter alia, judgment of 21 December 2016, Ucar and Kilic, C‑508/15 and C‑509/15, EU:C:2016:986, paragraph 51 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the present case, however, given that the labels or the symbols displayed by BSH on the packaging of the vacuum cleaners it markets are not provided for in Delegated Regulation No 665/2013, they must be deemed not to satisfy the requirements of that regulation. It follows that the display of them is prohibited if it is likely to mislead or confuse the final consumer with respect to the consumption of energy of the vacuum cleaner during its use.</p>

            <p>It is for the referring court to determine, in view of all the relevant factors, whether the display of the labels or the symbols used by BSH carries such a risk.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, it is apparent from the settled case-law of the Court that, in preliminary ruling proceedings, although it is ultimately for the national court to assess the facts, the Court of Justice, which is called on to provide answers of use to the national court, may provide guidance based inter alia on the documents in the file and on the written and oral observations which have been submitted to it, in order to enable the national court to give judgment (judgment of 5 June 2014, I, C‑255/13, EU:C:2014:1291, paragraph 55 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be pointed out that it follows from the very wording of Article 3(1)(b) of Directive 2010/30 that the Court must strictly apply the criterion referred to in paragraph 52 of the present judgment, intended to protect the final consumer against any risk of error or confusion related to the energy consumption during the use of the electric device in question. The strict application of that criterion is borne out by that directive's objective of environmental protection, as has been recalled in paragraph 33 of the present judgment.</p>

            <p>In addition, it must be noted that, in the context of Directive 2005/29, the benchmark to be used for a misleading commercial practice is that of the average consumer, who is reasonably well-informed and reasonably observant and circumspect, taking into account social, cultural and linguistic factors (judgments of 12 May 2011, Ving Sverige, C‑122/10, EU:C:2011:299, paragraph 22, and of 26 October 2016, Canal Digital Danmark, C‑611/14, EU:C:2016:800, paragraph 39). The inextricable link between the issues justifies the use of that same criterion also in the context of the assessment of the risk of error or of confusion referred to in Article 3(1)(b) of Directive 2010/30.</p>

          <content eId="para_18052__content">
            <p>In that regard, the mere fact that the labels or the symbols displayed by BSH refer to information already present on the energy label cannot suffice to rule out the existence of such a risk. It should be pointed out, first, that the symbols used by BSH are not graphically identical to those used on the energy label and, second, that some of the labels or symbols used by BSH repeat the same information while using a distinct graphic for each label, which could give the impression that they convey different information each time.</p>

            <p>The answer to the second question, therefore, should be that Delegated Regulation No 665/2013, read in the light of Article 3(1)(b) of Directive 2010/30, must be interpreted as meaning that it prohibits the display, in a place other than the energy label, of labels or symbols recalling the information contained on that energy label, if such display is likely to mislead or confuse end-users with respect to the consumption of energy of the vacuum cleaner marketed at retail at issue during its use, which is for the referring court to verify, in view of all the relevant factors and having regard to the perception of the average end-user, who is reasonably well-informed and reasonably observant and circumspect, taking into account social, cultural and linguistic factors.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 7 of Directive 2005/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 May 2005 concerning unfair business-to-consumer commercial practices in the internal market and amending Council Directive 84/450/EEC, Directives 97/7/EC, 98/27/EC and 2002/65/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council and Regulation (EC) No 2006/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council must be interpreted as meaning that the act of not providing consumers with information on the testing conditions that resulted in the energy classification indicated on the label relating to the energy class of vacuum cleaners, the model of which is shown in Annex II to Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) No 665/2013 of 3 May 2013 supplementing Directive 2010/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to energy labelling of vacuum cleaners does not constitute a `misleading omission' within the meaning of that provision. 2. Delegated Regulation No 665/2013, read in the light of Article 3(1)(b) of Directive 2010/30/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 May 2010 on the indication by labelling and standard product information of the consumption of energy and other resources by energy-related products, must be interpreted as meaning that it prohibits the display, in a place other than the label relating to the energy class of vacuum cleaners, the model of which is shown in Annex II to Delegated Regulation No 665/2013, of labels or symbols recalling the information contained on that energy label, if such display is likely to mislead or confuse end-users with respect to the consumption of energy of the vacuum cleaner marketed at retail at issue during its use, which is for the referring court to verify, in view of all the relevant factors and having regard to the perception of the average end-user, who is reasonably well-informed and reasonably observant and circumspect, taking into account social, cultural and linguistic factors.</p>
