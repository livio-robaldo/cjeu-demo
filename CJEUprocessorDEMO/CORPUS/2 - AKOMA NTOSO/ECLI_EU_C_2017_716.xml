The General Court held that, having regard, in particular, to the fact that the 2002 decision contained no reference to Article 3 or Article 15(2) of Regulation No 17, the decision was based on Article 65(4) and (5) CS alone ... Since those provisions had expired on 23 July 2002, the Commission could no longer derive competence from those provisions, which were no longer in force when it adopted the 2002 decision, in order to establish an infringement of Article 65(1) CS and to impose fines on the undertakings which had allegedly participated in the infringement ...</p>

It also stated that, having regard to the limited scope of the judgments annulling the 2002 decision, the re-adopted decision would be based on the evidence presented in the statement of objections and the supplementary statement of objections.

            <p>In the decision of 30 September 2009, the Commission considered, inter alia, that Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules on competition laid down in Articles [101 and 102 TFEU] ( OJ 2003 L 1, p. 1) was to be interpreted as empowering it to establish and sanction, after 23 July 2002, cartels in the sectors which fell within the scope of the ECSC Treaty ratione materiae and ratione temporis. It stated that the decision had been adopted in conformity with the procedural rules of the EC Treaty as well as the aforementioned regulation, and that the material provisions that were no longer in force at the date of adoption of an act could be applied under the principles governing the temporal succession of rules, subject to application of the principle lex mitior.</p>

According to Ferriere Nord, that interpretation is incorrect in so far as the statement of objections adopted on the basis of Article 36 CS cannot substantiate the decision at issue adopted on the basis of Regulation No 1/2003.</p>

            <p>According to Ferriere Nord, the adoption of a new statement of objections was required following the judgment of 25 October 2007, Ferriere Nord v Commission ( T‑94/03, not published, EU:T:2007:320) and would have been a correct application of the judgment of 15 October 2002, Limburgse Vinyl Maatschappij and Others v Commission ( C‑238/99 P, C‑244/99 P, C‑245/99 P, C‑247/99 P, C‑250/99 P to C‑252/99 P and C‑254/99 P, EU:C:2002:582), in paragraph 73 of which the Court ruled that the annulment of an EU measure does not necessarily affect the preparatory acts, and the procedure for replacing such a measure may, in principle, be resumed at the very point at which the illegality occurred. By using the terms `not necessarily' and `in principle' the Court did not exclude the fact that, having regard to the particularities of the case, the procedure could resume from an earlier stage than the point at which the illegality giving rise to the annulment the measure occurred.</p>

In addition, Ferriere Nord makes the erroneous assumption that the decision at issue penalised a different infringement to that found in the 2002 decision. In fact, it is apparent from the content of the decision at issue that the infringement found consisted in a cartel covering the whole of the Italian market, that is to say a substantial part of the common market and, accordingly, a cartel prohibited by Article 65(1) CS.</p>

            <p>Regarding the arguments raised by Ferriere Nord in the first place, the Commission's plea of inadmissibility must be rejected. It is clear from the appeal that Ferriere Nord is not merely asking the Court for clarifications on the question posed, but is seeking to demonstrate that the General Court erred in law, in particular in paragraph 121 of the judgment under appeal, by holding that it was not necessary to issue a new statement of objections before the adoption of the decision at issue. Similarly, contrary to the Commission's assertion, Ferriere Nord's argument regarding the lack of a hearing before the Hearing Officer is sufficiently precise to be admissible, since the appeal refers to both the provisions of EU law that in its opinion the General Court infringed in that regard and the paragraph of the judgment under appeal in which it considers that infringement to have been committed.</p>

            <p>As regards the substance of Ferriere Nord's arguments concerning the failure to both issue a new statement of objections and hold a hearing before the Hearing Officer, it must be noted that, in the context of the procedure leading to the adoption of the 2002 decision, the Commission did, on 26 March 2002, send the statement of objections to the undertakings concerned, including Ferriere Nord, in accordance with Article 36 CS. The oral hearing relating to that statement of objections took place on 13 June 2002. After expiry of the ECSC Treaty, on 12 August 2002 the Commission sent the undertakings the supplementary statement of objections based on Article 19(1) of Regulation No 17, in which it explained its position regarding the change in the legal framework and invited them to make known their own points of view on the supplementary statement of objections. An oral hearing took place on 30 September 2002 in the presence of representatives of the Member States.</p>

Therefore, given that, as is clear from paragraph 43 of the present judgment, the statement of objections and the supplementary statement of objections were not affected by the annulment of the 2002 decision, it is necessary to assess whether the Commission gave the parties the opportunity to develop their arguments at an oral hearing conducted in accordance with the procedural requirements of Regulations No 1/2003 and 773/2004, as it was required to do.</p>

This is clear, first, from that statement, which expressly invited its addressees to make their point of view on those supplementary objections known. Second, the Commission stated, in paragraph 382 of the decision at issue, that it did not consider it necessary to repeat the oral hearing of 13 June 2002, in application of the provisions of Regulations No 17 and 1/2003, since that hearing, in which the Member State representatives did not participate, had been conducted in conformity with the rules of the ECSC Treaty, which was applicable at the time.

            <p>Accordingly, the procedure is necessarily vitiated, regardless of any possible detrimental consequences for Ferriere Nord that could result from that infringement (see, to that effect, judgments of 6 November 2012, Commission v Éditions Odile Jacob, C‑553/10 P and C‑554/10 P, EU:C:2012:682, paragraphs 46 to 52, and of 9 June 2016, CEPSA v Commission, C‑608/13 P, EU:C:2016:414, paragraph 36).</p>

            <p>It follows from the above that the second ground of appeal put forward by Ferriere Nord must be upheld and, accordingly, the judgment under appeal must be set aside, without the Court needing to examine the other arguments put forward by the latter in the context of this ground of appeal, if they are admissible, nor the other grounds of appeal.</p>

            <p>Article 138(1) of those rules, which is applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) of the same rules, provides that the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party's pleadings. Since Ferriere Nord has been successful on appeal, and the action before the General Court was upheld, the Commission must be ordered to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by Ferriere Nord both at first instance and on appeal, in accordance with the form of order sought by Ferriere Nord. On those grounds, the Court (Ninth Chamber) hereby: 1. Sets aside the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 9 December 2014, Ferriere Nord v Commission (T‑90/10, not published,EU:T:2014:1035); 2. Annuls Commission Decision C(2009) 7492 final of 30 September 2009 relating to a proceeding under Article 65 CS (Case COMP/37.956 -- Reinforcing bars, re-adoption), as amended by Commission Decision C(2009) 9912 final of 8 December 2009, in so far as it concerns Ferriere Nord SpA; 3. Orders the European Commission to bear its own costs and to pay those incurred by Ferriere Nord SpA both at first instance and in the present appeal.</p>
