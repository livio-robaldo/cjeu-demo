To that end, as is shown by the sixth to eighth recitals, that directive is designed to harmonise duty on capital contributions to companies in the European Community by introducing a single duty on the raising of capital, which can be charged only once within the common market, and by abolishing all other indirect taxes with the same characteristics as that single capital duty.</p>

            <p>The United Kingdom does not charge capital duty. However, it charges stamp duty on certain documents which effect the transfer of shares. In the case of a sale by means of a written document, stamp duty of 0.5% of the amount or value of the consideration given for the transfer is charged under paragraph 1 of Schedule 13 to the Finance Act 1999. In the case of a transfer of shares otherwise than on sale, there was a charge to stamp duty of GBP 5 (approximately EUR 7) under paragraph 16 of Schedule 13 to the Finance Act 1999. That duty of GBP 5 was abolished in 2008.</p>

            <p>Because of the difficulty of levying the tax on each transfer of ownership taking place in clearance systems, special provisions apply. The legislation (in this case section 70 or section 96 of the FA 1986), provides for payment of stamp duty or SDRT at the rate of 1.5% on the initial entry of shares into a clearance system, while subsequent transfers within the clearance system will be free from charges. However, with the approval of HMRC, a clearance service may make an election for an alternative system of charge, as referred to in section 97A of the FA 1986, under which there is no 1.5% charge on the entry of the shares into the clearance service; instead, any transfer of the shares within the clearance service is charged to SDRT at a rate of 0.5% of the amount of the consideration for the transfer.</p>

            <p>The UK legislation does not define an accountable person in respect of stamp duty. However, if a share transfer is not duly stamped, the transferee of the shares cannot be registered as the legal owner of the shares and the share transfer is inadmissible as evidence in court proceedings. The transferee would, therefore, normally ensure that the stamp duty is paid. However, in relation to a clearance service, it was standard commercial practice for the company whose shares were to be placed into the clearance service to pay the stamp duty. It was thus Air Berlin which paid the stamp duty on the 2006 and 2009 share transfers.</p>

                <p>26 The first and second questions must be considered together. By the first question the referring court asks whether Article 10 or 11 of Directive 69/335, Article 4 or 5 of Directive 2008/7 or Articles 12, 43, 48, 49 or 56 EC (now Articles 18, 49, 54, 56 and 63 TFEU) must be interpreted as precluding the levying, by a Member State, of stamp duty of 1.5% on a transfer of shares to a clearance service. By the second question the referring court asks whether the answer to the first question differs where the transfer of shares to the clearance service was required in order to facilitate a listing of the company concerned on a stock exchange in that Member State or another Member State.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, it should be noted that both Directive 69/335 and Directive 2008/7, which repealed and replaced it, provided for complete harmonisation of the cases in which the Member States may levy indirect taxes on the raising of capital (see, to that effect, judgments of 7 June 2007, Commission v Greece, Câ€‘178/05, EU:C:2007:317, paragraph 31, and of 1 October 2009, HSBC Holdings and Vidacos Nominees, Câ€‘569/07, EU:C:2009:594, paragraph 25).</p>

            <p>As the Court has already held, where a matter is harmonised at EU level, national measures relating thereto must be assessed in the light of the provisions of that harmonising measure and not of those of the FEU Treaty (see, to that effect, judgment of 1 October 2009, HSBC Holdings and Vidacos Nominees, Câ€‘569/07, EU:C:2009:594, paragraph 25 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It must be stated in that regard that Article 4 of Directive 2008/7 concerns restructuring operations and does not appear to be relevant in the main proceedings. It is therefore appropriate to interpret Articles 10 and 11 of Directive 69/335 and Article 5 of Directive 2008/7, which prohibit, inter alia, any form of indirect tax in respect of contributions of capital and in respect of the creation, issue, admission to quotation on a stock exchange, making available on the market or dealing in stocks, shares or other securities of the same type.</p>

            <p>The Court has thus held that, in accordance with the objectives of Article 11 of Directive 69/335 and Article 5(2) of Directive 2008/7, the prohibition of the taxation of transactions for the raising of capital also applies to transactions which are not expressly covered by that prohibition, where such taxation is tantamount to taxing a transaction forming an integral part of an overall transaction with regard to the raising of capital (see, to that effect, judgment of 9 October 2014, Gielen, Câ€‘299/13, EU:C:2014:2266, paragraph 24 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the case before the referring court, the chargeable events giving rise to SDRT consist in the implementation of two separate transactions. The first is the transfer, in 2006, by Air Berlin to Clearstream Frankfurt of legal title to 40177604 existing ordinary shares held by the existing shareholders. The second is the issue, in 2009, of a further 4500000 ordinary shares to three different shareholders, legal title to which was then transferred to Clearstream Frankfurt. An interpretation of Directive 69/335 is relevant for the first transaction, whilst an interpretation of Directive 2008/7 is relevant for the second transaction.</p>

          <content eId="para_952__content">
            <p>As regards the transaction that took place in 2006, the United Kingdom submits that it involved the transfer of existing shares to a clearance service, no new capital being raised for the company. It argues that stamp duty could be charged on that transfer under Article 12(1)(a) of Directive 69/335, which provides that, notwithstanding Articles 10 and 11 of the directive, Member States may charge duties on the transfer of securities. The United Kingdom disputes the interpretation put forward by Air Berlin, which contends that Article 12 of Directive 69/335 must be confined solely to situations where there is a change of ownership between persons acting as investors, so that a transfer to a clearance service falls outside the scope of that provision. According to the United Kingdom, the concept of `transfer of securities' in Article 12 of the directive covers any transaction by which a right or interest in securities is transferred from one person to another and is not dependent on the status or capacity of the transferor and transferee. That is, in its submission, the case of a transfer of securities to a clearance service which affects the ownership of the security and fundamentally alters the respective rights of the parties, even though beneficial ownership is not transferred to the clearance service.</p>

            <p>In that connection, although the referring court has not described in detail either the functioning of the clearance service or the legal, formal and practical consequences of the transfer to Clearstream Frankfurt of legal title to the shares, the United Kingdom has acknowledged that that transfer did not result in the beneficial ownership of the shares being transferred. It is thus apparent that the transfer of legal title, which is required under German law, was merely an operational requirement of the clearance system and had no impact on the right to dispose of the shares or to have the benefit of them. The order for reference indicates in this regard that 2177604 ordinary shares held by employees who were not free to sell them could be listed on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, although legal title to the shares had been transferred to the clearance service.</p>

            <p>It follows that such a transfer of legal ownership, which has no impact on the beneficial ownership, cannot be considered to be a transfer of securities forming an independent transaction on which duty may be charged under Article 12(1)(a) of Directive 69/335. That transfer must be regarded as merely an incidental transaction, integral to the transaction admitting the shares to listing on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, which, in accordance with Article 11 of Directive 69/335, could not be subject to any form of taxation whatsoever.</p>

            <p>The requirement under German law that, for a company to be quoted on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, all shares of the same class must be listed, including shares which are not going to be sold in the initial public offering, may be an indication that there is an overall transaction the purpose of which is a company's admission to quotation on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange also entailing the transfer of legal title to the shares to Clearstream Frankfurt. However, the existence of a legal obligation is not a pre-requisite when it falls to be determined whether a transaction is `an end in itself' or must be regarded as forming an integral part of an overall transaction with regard to the raising of capital.</p>

            <p>So far as the 2009 transaction is concerned, the United Kingdom emphasises that the transfer of shares that took place on 7 October 2009 was a transaction separate from and subsequent to the increase in capital brought about by the issue of 4500000 shares to new subscribers, which took place on 10 June 2009. That transaction could therefore be subject to tax on the transfer of securities, in accordance with Article 6(1)(a) of Directive 2008/7.</p>

The issue of securities is not an end in itself, and has no point until those securities find investors (judgments of 15 July 2004, Commission v Belgium, Câ€‘415/02, EU:C:2004:450, paragraph 32, and of 1 October 2009, HSBC Holdings and Vidacos Nominees, Câ€‘569/07, EU:C:2009:594, paragraph 32).</p>

By the fourth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the answer would be different if the benefit of the election could not be enjoyed.</p>
