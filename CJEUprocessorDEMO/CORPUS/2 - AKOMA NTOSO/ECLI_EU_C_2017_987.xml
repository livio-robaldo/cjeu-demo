            <p>That said, it is necessary to answer the third question in so far as it is clear from the order for reference that, in the present case, Protect's action was dismissed by the court of first instance precisely because it had lost the status of party to the procedure pursuant to the time-barring rule set out in Paragraph 42 of the AVG, from which it follows that the question is not manifestly hypothetical within the meaning of the settled case-law of the Court (see, inter alia, judgment of 12 October 2017, Kubicka, C‑218/16, EU:C:2017:755, paragraphs 30 and 31).</p>

            <p>As to the substance of the third question, it must be noted that Article 9(3) of the Aarhus Convention expressly provides that the review procedures forming the subject of that provision may also be subject to `criteria', from which it follows that, in principle, Member States may, in the context of the discretion they have in that regard, establish procedural rules setting out conditions that must be satisfied in order to be able to pursue such review procedures.</p>

            <p>In that context, it must, however, be noted that, when they set out detailed procedural rules for legal actions intended to ensure the protection of rights conferred by Directive 2000/60, the Member States must ensure compliance with the right to an effective remedy and to a fair hearing, enshrined in Article 47 of the Charter, which constitutes a reaffirmation of the principle of effective judicial protection (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 27 September 2017, Puškár, C‑73/16, EU:C:2017:725, paragraph 59 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In principle, Article 9(3) of the Aarhus Convention does not preclude a rule imposing a time limit, such as the one set out in Paragraph 42 of the AVG, obliging the effective exercise, from the administrative procedure stage, of the right of a party to the procedure to submit objections regarding compliance with the relevant rules of environmental law, since such a rule may allow areas for dispute to be identified as quickly as possible and, where possible, resolved during the administrative procedure so that judicial proceedings are no longer necessary.</p>

            <p>Thus, such a rule imposing a time limit may contribute to the objective of Article 9(3) of the Aarhus Convention, set out in the 18th recital of that convention, of providing effective judicial mechanisms and appears also to be in line with Article 9(4) of that convention, which requires that the procedures referred to, inter alia, in Article 9(3) of the convention provide `adequate and effective' remedies that are `equitable'.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it is hard to criticise Protect for having failed to prevent the time limit set out in Paragraph 42 of the AVG from being applied by exercising, already at the administrative procedure stage, the right, conferred by virtue of being a party to the procedure, to submit objections based on an infringement of legislation governing water-related matters, which seeks to transpose Directive 2000/60 into national law.</p>

            <p>Protect asked the competent authorities to accord it the status of party to the procedure, but was refused principally on the ground that Paragraph 102(1) of the WRG has no legal basis to that effect. Consequently, Protect had to participate in the administrative procedure as an `interested party' within the meaning of Paragraph 102(2) of the WRG, which, in accordance with Paragraph 102(3) of the WRG, did not grant it the right to submit objections that the authorities had to take into account before taking a decision on the application for a permit.</p>

            <p>Consequently, having regard to applicable national procedural law, it appears that complaining that an organisation failed to submit objections in good time in order to avoid the time limit set out in Paragraph 42 of the AVG from being applied is equivalent to requiring that organisation to fulfil an obligation that it cannot, a priori, fulfil. However, no one can be obliged to do the impossible ( impossibilium nulla obligatio est).</p>

            <p>In addition, even though, as the Austrian Government claims, the obligation set out in Paragraph 42 of the AVG is more procedural in nature, in the sense that, in order to avoid the time limit from being applied, it would suffice for the objections submitted merely to state generally that the permit for the project at issue was contrary to a provision of the WRG and the justification for the objections could be supplied at a later stage, the fact remains that, in the main action, environmental organisations could reasonably conclude from the applicable procedural rules that they first had to obtain the status of party to the procedure in order then to be able to exercise the right to submit objections, such right being conferred by that status.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 9(3) of the Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters, signed at Aarhus on 25 June 1998 and approved on behalf of the European Community by Council Decision 2005/370/EC of 17 February 2005, read in conjunction with Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, must be interpreted as meaning that a duly constituted environmental organisation operating in accordance with the requirements of national law must be able to contest before a court a decision granting a permit for a project that may be contrary to the obligation to prevent the deterioration of the status of bodies of water as set out in Article 4 of Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy. 2. The combined provisions of Article 9(3) of that convention approved by Decision 2005/370, Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights and Article 14(1) of Directive 2000/60 must be interpreted as precluding national procedural rules that deprive, in situations such as that in question in the main action, environmental organisations of the right to participate, as a party to the procedure, in a permit procedure that is intended to implement Directive 2000/60 and limit the right to bring proceedings contesting decisions resulting from such procedure solely to persons who do have that status. 3. Subject to verification by the referring court of the relevant matters of fact and national law, Article 9(3) and (4) of that convention approved by Decision 2005/370, read in conjunction with Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, must be interpreted as precluding, in a situation such as that in question in the main action, a national procedural rule that imposes a time limit on an environmental organisation, pursuant to which a person loses the status of party to the procedure and therefore cannot bring an action against the decision resulting from that procedure if it failed to submit objections in good time following the opening of the administrative procedure and, at the very latest, during the oral phase of that procedure.</p>
