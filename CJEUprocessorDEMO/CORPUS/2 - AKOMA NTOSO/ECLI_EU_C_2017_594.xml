That court found, in particular, that, in accordance with the provisions of Directive 2003/8, assistance with the costs of translation of the supporting documents for a legal aid application is to be granted when that application is lodged with the transmitting authority within the meaning of Article 13(1)(a) of that directive, that is to say, the competent authority of the Member State in which the applicant is domiciled or habitually resident. However, those provisions do not provide for assistance with those costs when the application is lodged, as in the present case, directly with the receiving authority within the meaning of Article 13(1)(b) of that directive, that is to say, the competent authority of the Member State of the court hearing the case or in which the decision is to be enforced.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, according to that court, pursuant to Paragraphs 114 and 1078 of the ZPO, legal aid includes only the costs connected with the court proceedings. That aid, it found, therefore does not cover the costs of translation of documents intended to be produced in the course of the procedure for examining the legal aid application in so far as those costs are deemed to be incurred outside of the dispute proceedings.</p>

            <p>The applicant in the main proceedings brought an appeal against that decision before the Bundesarbeitsgericht (Federal Labour Court, Germany). That court takes the view that it cannot be deduced with the requisite clarity from Directive 2003/8 whether, and to what extent, the Member State of the court hearing the case must cover the costs of translation of the supporting documents relating to a legal aid application when, as in the main proceedings in the present case, the legal aid applicant has himself arranged for those documents to be translated and has lodged his application directly with the court having jurisdiction as to the substance of the dispute, which also has jurisdiction in respect of that application in its capacity as the receiving authority within the meaning of Article 13(1)(b) of that directive. It notes, however, that the refusal to extend legal aid to cover the costs of translation of those documents, assuming that this constitutes a restriction on the effective access to justice, pursues a legitimate objective, namely to relieve the public purse of the Member State of the court hearing the case of costs which should instead be borne by the Member State in which the applicant is domiciled or habitually resident.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the Bundesarbeitsgericht (Federal Labour Court) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling: `Does the right of a natural person to effective access to justice in a cross-border dispute within the meaning of Articles 1 and 2 of Directive 2003/8 require that legal aid granted by the Federal Republic of Germany must extend to the costs incurred by the applicant for the translation of the declaration and supporting documents annexed to the legal aid application, where the applicant, at the same time as bringing the action, applies for legal aid to the court hearing the case, which is also the competent receiving authority within the meaning of Article 13(1)(b) of [that] directive, and he has himself arranged for the translation to be made?'</p>

That requirement also relates to the documents and supporting evidence which, due to the cross-border dimension of the dispute, are drafted in a language other than the language of the proceedings and must consequently be translated.</p>

            <p>The submission of a legal aid application, either before the transmitting authority or before the receiving authority, is, as the Advocate General has noted, essentially, in point 42 of his Opinion, a precondition for ensuring effective access to justice, which that directive seeks to ensure, in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>

            <p>In that context, it must be recalled that the supporting documents for a legal aid application are, within the scheme of Directive 2003/8, of particular importance. In accordance with Article 5(1) of that directive, legal aid is granted to persons who are partly or totally unable to meet the costs of proceedings as a result of their economic situation. Pursuant to Article 5(2) of that directive, the economic situation of a person is to be assessed by the competent authority of the Member State of the court hearing the case, in the light of various objective factors such as income, capital or family situation. Thus, if the applicant fails to present certain documents demonstrating his personal and financial circumstances, the legal aid application cannot be accepted. Those documents therefore constitute a prerequisite for obtaining that aid.</p>

            <p>For the purposes of the case in the main proceedings, it should be noted that, in accordance with Article 8(b) of that directive, the Member State in which the legal aid applicant is domiciled or habitually resident is required to provide the legal aid necessary to cover the costs of translation of the application and of the supporting documents necessary for the processing of that application `when the application is submitted to the authorities in that Member State'.</p>

            <p>In that context, the clarification set out in the final part of Article 8(b) of Directive 2003/8 must be interpreted as meaning that it does not give rise to a condition which must be satisfied in every case by the legal aid applicant in order for him to be entitled to have those costs covered, but rather that provision is limited to highlighting the possibility that the recipient may have those costs covered in the State in which he is domiciled or habitually resident, without, however, excluding such a coverage of the costs when, as in the dispute in the main proceedings, the application is submitted in the Member State of the court hearing the case.</p>

            <p>In other words, as the Advocate General has noted, essentially, in point 53 of his Opinion, Article 8(b) of Directive 2003/8 must be understood as meaning that it provides, as an exception to the general rule requiring that the Member State of the court hearing the case should cover the costs connected to the cross-border nature of a dispute, for the coverage by the Member State of the domicile or habitual residence of the costs of translation of the legal aid application and of the supporting documents necessary for the processing of that application.</p>

            <p>In the third place, it must be held that exclusion of the coverage by the Member State of the court hearing the case of the costs connected to the translation of the supporting documents necessary for processing a legal aid application would run counter to the objectives pursued by Directive 2003/8, as referred to in paragraphs 25 to 27 above, concerning effective access to justice in cross-border disputes, given that it would penalise the legal aid applicant in the situation where he decides to submit his aid application directly to the receiving authority.</p>

            <p>As is clear from paragraph 29 of the present judgment, Article 13 of Directive 2003/8 offers a legal aid applicant the choice between two alternative and non-hierarchical options by allowing him to present his legal aid application either before the transmitting authority or before the receiving authority.</p>

            <p>However, if the costs connected with the translation of the supporting documents necessary for the processing of a legal aid application were covered only when the legal aid applicant addresses them to the competent authorities in the Member State in which he is domiciled or habitually resident, that would incorrectly make securing legal aid in respect of those costs dependent on the procedural option chosen by the applicant and would render meaningless Article 13(1)(b) of Directive 2003/8, which offers the possibility of presenting the legal aid application directly to the receiving authority.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, as the Advocate General has noted in point 46 of his Opinion, such an exclusion would be likely to lead to a more onerous procedural solution for the legal aid applicant. Instead of submitting his legal aid application directly to the court with jurisdiction to hear the substantive dispute, that applicant would be obliged to open two separate sets of proceedings, the first being before the competent court of the Member State of the court hearing the case in order to ensure compliance with time limits, and the second being before the authorities in the Member State in which he is domiciled or habitually resident in order to obtain reimbursement of the costs incurred in connection with the legal aid application.</p>
