According to Incyte, the Office made a miscalculation by using, as the basis for calculating the duration of the SPC, not the date on which the addressee was given notification of the decision on the MA, but the date on which it was granted, which disregards the interpretation adopted in the judgment of 6 October 2015, Seattle Genetics ( C‑471/14, EU:C:2015:659).</p>

A balance between the requirement for legal certainty and the requirement for legality under EU law is thereby struck (judgment of 4 October 2012, Byankov, C‑249/11, EU:C:2012:608, paragraph 77 and the case-law cited).</p>

The balance between the requirement for legal certainty and the requirement for legality under EU law is, in such circumstances, not the same as that set out in paragraphs 46 and 47 above. A change, such as replacing the date of 24 August 2027, as the date of the expiry of the SPC, with the date of 28 August 2027, as requested by Incyte on the basis of the judgment of 6 October 2015, Seattle Genetics ( C‑471/14, EU:C:2015:659), is by its nature less capable of affecting legal certainty than the more substantive changes which require a review.</p>

            <p>As regards its scheme, it is clear from Article 13(1) of Regulation No 469/2009 that the certificate is to take effect for a period equal to the period which elapsed between the date on which the application for a basic patent was lodged and the date of the first MA in the European Union, reduced by a period of five years. It therefore follows from that provision that the duration during which the SPC granted `shall take effect' is wholly determined by the application of the detailed criteria laid down by that provision and the authority responsible for granting the SPC enjoys no degree of discretion in that regard.</p>

            <p>Similarly, Article 14(1) of Regulation No 469/2009 provides that the SPC is to lapse on the date laid down in Article 13 and not on a date to be determined by the authority which grants the certificate.</p>

            <p>As regards the objectives pursued by Regulation No 469/2009, it should be noted, first, that the fundamental objective of Regulation No 469/2009, as mentioned, inter alia, in recitals 3 to 5 and 8 and 9 of that regulation, is to re-establish a sufficient period of effective protection of a basic patent by permitting the holder to enjoy an additional period of exclusivity on the expiry of his patent, which is intended to compensate, at least in part, for the delay to the commercial exploitation of his invention by reason of the time which has elapsed between the date on which the application for that patent was filed and the date on which the first marketing authorisation in the European Union was granted (see, inter alia, judgment of 6 October 2015, Seattle Genetics, C‑471/14, EU:C:2015:659, paragraph 32 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Furthermore, as is apparent from recitals 7 and 8 thereof, Regulation No 469/2009 establishes a uniform solution at European Union level by creating an SPC which may be obtained by the holder of a national or European patent under the same conditions in each Member State. It thus aims to prevent the heterogeneous development of national laws leading to further disparities which would be likely to create obstacles to the free movement of medicinal products within the European Union and thus directly affect the establishment and the functioning of the internal market (see, inter alia, judgment of 6 October 2015, Seattle Genetics, C‑471/14, EU:C:2015:659, paragraph 26 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It is consistent with those twin objectives of protection for the holder and uniform application of the conditions under which that protection is ensured, that the holder may require rectification of the instrument granting an SPC in respect of its duration at any time, provided that the certificate has not expired.</p>

            <p>Lastly, in so far as it is common ground that, in the case in the main proceedings, Incyte brought before the authority which granted the SPC an appeal for rectification of the duration of the SPC, it is not necessary to ascertain, in addition, whether that authority could be required to make such a rectification ex officio in the absence of such an appeal brought by the holder of the certificate.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 18 du Regulation (EC) No 469/2009 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 6 May 2009 concerning the supplementary protection certificate for medicinal products, read in the light of Article 17(2) of Regulation (EC) No 1610/96 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 July 1996 concerning the creation of a supplementary protection certificate for plant protection products, must be interpreted as meaning that the date of the first authorisation to place the product on the market, as stated in an application for a supplementary protection certificate, on the basis of which the national authority competent for granting such a certificate calculated the duration of the certificate, is incorrect in a situation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, where the date led to a method for calculating the duration of the certificate which does not comply with the requirements of Article 13(1) of Regulation No 469/2009, as interpreted by a subsequent judgment of the Court. 2. Article 18 of Regulation No 469/2009, read in the light of recital 17 and of Article 17(2) of Regulation No 1610/96, must be interpreted as meaning that, in a situation such as that set out in point 1 of this operative part, the holder of a supplementary protection certificate may, under Article 18 of Regulation No 469/2009, bring an appeal for rectification of the duration stated in the certificate, provided that that certificate has not expired.</p>
