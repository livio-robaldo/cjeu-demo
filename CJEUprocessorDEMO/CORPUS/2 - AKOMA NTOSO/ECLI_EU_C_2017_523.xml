            <p>On 26 April 2010, the Bundesverband simulated a booking on Air Berlin's website for a single flight from Berlin-Tegel airport (Germany) to Cologne (Germany). At the first stage of the booking, a list in table form showing possible flight connections at different prices was displayed. After selecting one of the flight connections, a table containing various items and their prices indicated, inter alia, an amount of EUR 3 under `Taxes and charges'. During another booking simulated by the Bundesverband on the same website, on 20 June 2010, for a return flight from Berlin-Tegel to Frankfurt am Main (Germany), an amount of EUR 1 was displayed under `Taxes and charges'.</p>

            <p>According to the Bundesverband, the amounts of the taxes and charges indicated on the Air Berlin website were much lower than those payable in practice by the airline company, under the schedules of charges of the airports in question, and were, as a consequence, likely to mislead the consumer. The Bundesverband, considering that that display was contrary to the third sentence of Article 23(1) of Regulation No 1008/2008, brought an action before the Landgericht Berlin (Regional Court, Berlin, Germany) for an order prohibiting that practice.</p>

            <p>In the context of that action, the Bundesverband also disputed the legality of the term in point 5.2 of Air Berlin's general terms and conditions available on its website ( `the general terms and conditions'), which states that Air Berlin is to charge, as a handling fee, an amount of EUR 25 per booking and per passenger on the amount to be reimbursed to the passenger when he has not taken a flight or cancelled his booking. The Bundesverband claimed that that term infringed Paragraph 307 of the BGB, in so far as it unduly disadvantaged the contracting partners of the airline company. It added that Air Berlin cannot charge any separate fees for the fulfilment of a legal obligation.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, contrary to what Air Berlin claims, relying, in particular, on recital 16 of Regulation 1008/2008, an air carrier which merely referred to the final price would not satisfy the requirements of the third sentence of Article 23(1) of that regulation, since they impose an obligation to indicate the amounts of the various items which make up that price.</p>

            <p>That finding is not called into question by the argument put forward by Air Berlin that the very wording of the third sentence of Article 23(1) of Regulation No 1008/2008 only obliges air carriers to specify the items listed in subparagraphs (b) to (d) of the third sentence of Article 23(1) of that regulation `where [those] items ... have been added to the air fare' and not when they have been included in that fare.</p>

            <p>Article 2(18) of Regulation No 1008/2008, which defines `air fares', does not refer to taxes, airport charges and other charges, surcharges and fees, as being items included in that fare. It follows that air carriers are not authorised to include those items in the air fare which they are obliged to specify by virtue of subparagraph (a) of the third sentence of Article 23(1) of that regulation.</p>

The phrase `where the items listed [in subparagraphs (b) to (d) of the third sentence of Article 23(1)] have been added to the air fare' is clearly intended to distinguish a situation in which air carriers choose to pass the costs of those items on to their customers from one in which they choose to bear the costs themselves, with the obligation to specify those items existing only in the former case.</p>

            <p>Article 23(1) of Regulation No 1008/2008 seeks to ensure, in particular, that there is information and transparency with regard to prices for air services from an airport located in a Member State and accordingly to contribute to safeguarding protection of customers who use those services. In that respect, it lays down information and transparency obligations as regards, in particular, the conditions applicable to air fares, the final price to be paid, the air fare and the unavoidable and foreseeable items that are added to the fare, and the optional price supplements relating to services that supplement the air service itself (judgment of 18 September 2014, Vueling Airlines, C‑487/12, EU:C:2014:2232, paragraph 32).</p>

On the other hand, full inclusion of those items in the air fare would have the effect that the amount indicated in respect of the air fare could be equal to the final price to be paid.

            <p>Having regard to the foregoing, the answer to the first question is that the third sentence of Article 23(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 must be interpreted as meaning that, when publishing their air fares, air carriers must specify separately the amounts payable by customers in respect of taxes, airport charges and other charges, surcharges or fees referred to in subparagraphs (b) to (d) of the third sentence of Article 23(1) of that regulation and may not, as a consequence include those items, even partially, in the air fare, referred to in subparagraph (a) of the third sentence of Article 23(1) of that regulation.</p>

            <p>Without there being any need to rule on the question whether the flat-rate handling fees provided for in point 5.2 of the general terms and condition are covered by the concept of `air fares' within the meaning of Regulation 1008/2008, and consequently, whether that term may benefit from the pricing freedom set out in Article 22(1) of that regulation, it must be noted that the purpose of Directive 93/13, in accordance with Article 1(1) thereof, is to approximate the laws of the Member States relating to unfair terms in contracts concluded between a seller or supplier and a consumer. It is accordingly a general directive for consumer protection, intended to apply in all sectors of economic activity. The objective of that directive is not to restrict the pricing freedom of air carriers but to require Member States to provide for a mechanism ensuring that every contractual term not individually negotiated may be reviewed in order to determine whether it is unfair for the purposes of the protection granted to a consumer on account of the fact that he is in a position of weakness vis-à-vis the seller or supplier, as regards both his bargaining power and his level of knowledge (see, to that effect, judgment of 26 February 2015, Matei, C‑143/13, EU:C:2015:127, paragraph 51 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In that context, it would be possible to find that that directive does not apply in the field of air services governed by Regulation No 1008/2008 only if it is clearly provided for by the provisions of that regulation. However, neither the wording of Article 22 of Regulation No 1008/2008 relating to pricing freedom nor that of the other provisions of that regulation permits such a view, even though Directive 93/13 was already in force on the date of adoption of that regulation.</p>

            <p>In that regard, the Commission is right to note that the pricing freedom laid down in Article 22 of Regulation No 1008/2008 is the culmination of progressive elimination of price controls by Member States in order to open up the sector to competition. As Advocate General Bot observed in point 27 of his Opinion in Vueling Airlines ( C‑487/12, EU:C:2014:27), the objective of the liberalisation of the airline market was to achieve greater variety in supply and lower prices for consumers. Thus, Council Regulation (EEC) No 2409/92 of 23 July 1992 on fares and rates for air services ( OJ 1992 L 240, p. 15), repealed by Regulation No 1008/2008, indicated in the fifth recital thereof that it was appropriate `to complement price freedom with adequate safeguards for the interests of consumers and industry'.</p>

            <p>The judgment of 18 September 2014, Vueling Airlines ( C‑487/12, EU:C:2014:2232) cannot lead to a different conclusion. In that judgment, the Court considered that Article 22(1) of Regulation No 1008/2008 precludes legislation, such as that at issue in that case, which requires air carriers to carry, in all circumstances, baggage checked-in by their passengers without it being possible to charge any price supplement to carry such baggage. By contrast, the Court did not in any way state that pricing freedom precludes, in general, the application of any consumer protection rule. On the contrary, the Court noted that, without prejudice to the application, in particular, of rules enacted in the field of consumer protection, EU law does not preclude Member States from regulating aspects of the contract of carriage by air, in order, in particular, to protect consumers against unfair practices, provided that the pricing provisions of Regulation (EC) No 1008/2008 are not affected (see, to that effect, judgment of 18 September 2014, Vueling Airlines, C‑487/12, EU:C:2014:2232, paragraph 44).</p>
