            <p>Having been affected by the global financial crisis which began in 2007, FIH benefited from two kinds of measure in the course of the year 2009. First, in June 2009, it received a hybrid tier 1 capital injection of 1.9 billion Danish krone (DKK) (approximately EUR 255 million), under the Lov om statstligt indskud i kreditinstitutter(Law on State-funded capital injections) of 3 February 2009 and executive orders adopted under that law. Secondly, in July 2009, the Kingdom of Denmark granted FIH a State guarantee totalling DKK 50 billion (approximately EUR 6.71 billion), under the Lov om finansiel stabilitet(Law on financial stability) of 10 October 2008, as amended by Law No 68 of 3 February 2009 (together, `the 2009 measures'). FIH used the entire amount of the guarantee to issue bonds.</p>

            <p>Those two laws were approved by the Commission in Decision C(2009) 776 final of 3 February 2009 on State aid scheme N31a/2009 -- Denmark, as aid schemes compatible with the internal market.</p>

            <p>As a result, in particular, of that downgrade and because the maturity date of the bonds issued by FIH was approaching, together with the expiry of the guarantee from the Danish State, it became apparent during 2011 that FIH would experience liquidity problems in 2012 or 2013 that were liable to lead to the loss of its banking licence and, therefore, to its liquidation.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, on 6 March 2012, the Kingdom of Denmark notified the Commission of a series of measures ( `the measures at issue'), including, first, the creation of a new subsidiary of FIH Holding, NewCo, to which the most problematic of FIH's assets, in essence mortgage loans and derivatives with a nominal value of approximately DKK 17.1 billion (approximately EUR 2.3 billion), were to be transferred in order to reduce the size of FIH's balance sheet.</p>

The FSC was to finance and recapitalise NewCo during the winding-up process, should that prove necessary.</p>

Nevertheless, in order to ensure financial stability, the Commission approved those measures for a six-month period or, if a restructuring plan was submitted by the Kingdom of Denmark during that period, until the Commission adopted a final decision on that plan.</p>

            <p>On 12 March 2014, the Commission notified the Kingdom of Denmark of the contested decision. By that decision, the Commission, first, classified the measures at issue as State aid, within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, and secondly, declared those measures compatible with the internal market, under paragraph 3(b) of that provision, in the light of the restructuring plan and the commitments made by the Kingdom of Denmark.</p>

          <content eId="para_7486__content">
            <p>In the first part of its assessment relating to the existence of aid, the Commission examined whether the measures at issue conferred an economic advantage on the FIH Group. For that purpose, it analysed the measures in accordance with the market economy operator principle ( `the private operator principle'), consisting in the present case, according to the contested decision, of ascertaining, in essence, whether a private investor in a market economy would have taken part in a given operation on the same terms and conditions as the public investor at the time when the decision to make public resources available was taken ( `the private investor test').</p>

          <content eId="para_7487__content">
            <p>Having completed its assessment, carried out in paragraphs 84 to 98 of the contested decision, the Commission found that, mainly owing to the insufficient level of remuneration provided in consideration for the resources that had to be committed by the Danish State, the measures at issue were not compatible with the private investor principle and had, therefore, procured an advantage for the FIH Group. According to its calculations, the amount of the aid was approximately DKK 2.25 billion (approximately EUR 300 million).</p>

            <p>It is apparent from those paragraphs that, although the Commission referred to the 2009 measures, in particular in paragraphs 88 and 98 of that decision, it nevertheless carried out the assessment of the economic rationality of the measures at issue without taking account of the possible cost that the Danish State would have had to bear, in the absence of those measures, because of the risks for that State stemming from the 2009 measures.</p>

            <p>As regards the compatibility of the aid with the internal market, the Commission examined the measures at issue in the light of its Communication on the treatment of impaired assets in the Community banking sector ( OJ 2009 C 72, p. 1) and its Communication on the application, from 1 January 2012, of State aid rules to support measures in favour of banks in the context of the financial crisis ( OJ 2011 C 356, p. 7).</p>

Those commitments provide, inter alia, for additional payments by FIH to the FSC and for FIH's commitment to withdraw from certain activities, including property finance, private equity and private wealth management.</p>

            <p>By its single ground of appeal, the Commission submits that the General Court committed an error of law in its application of the private operator principle, in holding that it was obliged, in order to assess whether the measures at issue constituted State aid within the meaning of Article 107(1) TFEU, to compare the behaviour of the Danish State at the time of their adoption, not to that of a private investor, but to that of a private creditor in a market economy ( `the private creditor test'), taking account of the financial risks to which that Member State was exposed because of the 2009 measures.</p>

            <p>In the Commission's view, the private operator principle arises from the neutrality of the EU legal order with regard to the rules governing property ownership. It follows that, in accordance with the case-law, economic transactions carried out by public bodies confer no advantage on their recipients, and therefore do not constitute State aid, if they are carried out under normal market conditions. On the other hand, if the public authority has not behaved like a private operator in a comparable situation, the recipient undertaking is deemed to have received an economic advantage.</p>

            <p>The Commission adds that the private operator principle is applied, leaving aside all considerations that relate exclusively to a Member State's role as a public authority.

            <p>In the present case, the Commission submits that the costs that had to be borne by the Danish State in 2012, resulting from the 2009 measures, simply reflected the obligations incumbent on that Member State as a public authority, since they were the direct result of the State aid conferring those measures in favour of FIH. The General Court therefore erred in law when it held, in paragraphs 62 to 69 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission was wrong, in its application of the private operator principle in the contested decision, not to take account of the cost that would have had to be borne by the Danish State if the latter had not adopted the measures at issue, resulting from the risks to which the 2009 measures exposed that state.</p>

According to the FIH Group, the Commission must ascertain whether or not such an amendment would have an additional advantage for the beneficiary of the initial aid.

            <p>As a preliminary point, it should be noted that, according to the settled case-law of the Court, classification of a measure as `State aid' for the purposes of Article 107(1) TFEU requires all of the conditions set out in that provision to be fulfilled. First, there must be an intervention by the State or through State resources. Second, the intervention must be liable to affect trade between Member States. Third, it must confer a selective advantage on the recipient. Fourth, it must distort or threaten to distort competition (see, inter alia, judgments of 21 December 2016, Commission v World Duty Free Group and Others, C‑20/15 P and C‑21/15 P, EU:C:2016:981, paragraph 53 and the case-law cited, and of 18 May 2017, Fondul Proprietatea, C‑150/16, EU:C:2017:388, paragraph 13).</p>

            <p>Since the present ground of appeal concerns only the third of those conditions, it should be noted that, according to the Court's settled case-law, measures that, whatever their form, are likely directly or indirectly to favour certain undertakings, or fall to be regarded as an economic advantage that the recipient undertaking would not have obtained under normal market conditions, are regarded as State aid (judgements of 2 September 2010, Commission v Deutsche Post, C‑399/08 P, EU:C:2010:481, paragraph 40 and the case-law cited, and of 27 June 2017, Congregación de Escuelas Pías Provincia Betania, C‑74/16, EU:C:2017:496, paragraph 65 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Thus, having regard to the objective of Article 107(1) TFEU of ensuring undistorted competition (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 September 2008, Germany and Others v Kronofrance, C‑75/05 P and C‑80/05 P, EU:C:2008:482, paragraph 66), including between public and private undertakings, the definition of `aid', within the meaning of that provision, cannot cover a measure granted to an undertaking through State resources where it could have obtained the same advantage in circumstances which correspond to normal market conditions. The assessment of the conditions under which such an advantage was granted is therefore made, in principle, by applying the private operator principle (see, to that effect, judgments of 5 June 2012, Commission v EDF, C‑124/10 P, EU:C:2012:318, paragraph 78, and of 20 September 2017, Commission v Frucona Košice, C‑300/16 P, EU:C:2017:706, paragraphs 21 and 22).</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the private operator principle is one of the factors that the Commission is required to take into account for the purposes of establishing the existence of aid and is not, therefore, an exception that applies only if a Member State so requests, when it has been found that the constituent elements of `State aid', as laid down in Article 107(1) TFEU, exist (judgments of 5 June 2012, Commission v EDF, C‑124/10 P, EU:C:2012:318, paragraph 103; of 3 April 2014, Commission v Netherlands and ING Groep, C‑224/12 P, EU:C:2014:213, paragraph 32; and of 20 September 2017, Frucona Košice v Commission, C‑300/16 P, EU:C:2017:706, paragraph 23).</p>

            <p>Consequently, when it appears that the private operator principle might be applicable, it is for the Commission to ask the Member State concerned to provide it with all the relevant information enabling it to determine whether the conditions for applying that test are satisfied (see, to that effect, judgments of 5 June 2012, Commission v EDF, C‑124/10 P, EU:C:2012:318, paragraph 104; of 3 April 2014, Commission v Netherlands and ING Groep, C‑224/12 P, EU:C:2014:213, paragraph 33; and of 20 September 2017, Commission v Frucona Košice, C‑300/16 P, EU:C:2017:706, paragraph 24 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In that regard, the Court has stated that where a Member State confers, in its capacity as shareholder and not in its capacity as public authority, an economic advantage on an undertaking, the applicability of the private operator principle does not depend on the means used to place that undertaking at an advantage nor on the nature of the means used, which may fall within the State's public powers (see, to that effect, judgments of 5 June 2012, Commission v EDF, C‑124/10 P, EU:C:2012:318, paragraphs 81 and 91 to 93).</p>

            <p>Moreover, the Court has held that the applicability of the private operator principle to an amendment to the conditions for the redemption of securities of an undertaking is not compromised because the acquisition of securities giving the State the status of an investor in that undertaking was financed by means of State aid in favour of that undertaking (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 April 2014, Commission v Netherlands and ING Groep, C‑224/12 P, EU:C:2014:213, paragraph 34).</p>

            <p>In particular, as regards the latter situation, the Court has stated that, since, by granting aid, a Member State pursues, by definition, objectives other than that of making a profit from the resources made available to undertakings, it must be held that those resources are, in principle, granted by the State exercising its prerogatives as a public authority (see, to that effect, judgment of 24 October 2013, Land Burgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C‑223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraph 56).</p>

It is apparent from paragraphs 47, 53 and 55 of that decision that the Commission, like the Danish Government itself, considered that the measures envisaged in those two laws constituted State aid, since a private investor would not have decided to make, to a comparable extent and in similar circumstances, the capital increases and the grants of guarantees at issue.</p>

            <p>Indeed, it is apparent from paragraphs 35 and 36 of the judgment of 3 April 2014, Commission v Netherlands and ING Groep ( C‑224/12 P, EU:C:2014:213), that it was, in that case, for the Commission to examine the economic rationality of the amendments proposed by the Dutch State to the terms governing repayment of the capital injection, which had previously been made by means of State aid, by reference to the conduct that a private investor might have adopted.</p>

            <p>However, as the Advocate General noted in points 63 and 65 to 68 of his Opinion, there is nothing to suggest that the Court required that institution to make an assessment that went beyond ascertaining the inherent economic rationality of the proposed amendments and that therefore required risks arising for the Dutch State from the State aid that it had previously granted to the recipient undertaking to be taken into account.</p>

            <p>Similarly, the Court stated, in paragraph 36 of the judgment of 3 April 2014, Commission v Netherlands and ING Groep ( C‑224/12 P, EU:C:2014:213), that a private investor might accept an amendment to the repayment terms of the earlier capital injection in order, in particular, to increase the prospects of obtaining the repayment of that injection. However, that does not mean that when analysing the inherent economic rationality of a measure in order to determine whether a private investor would have behaved in the same way as the State concerned, risks arising for that Member State from the previous grant of State aid may be taken into account.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be noted that, in the case giving rise to the judgment of 3 April 2014, Commission v Netherlands and ING Groep ( C‑224/12 P, EU:C:2014:213), and in contrast to the present case, the beneficiary of the previous aid was not, at the time when those amendments were contemplated, in financial difficulties affecting the continuous functioning of their operations and that those amendments did not involve a bail out by means of significant public investment.</p>

            <p>Those amendments were intended, in particular, to encourage the undertaking receiving the aid to make early repayment of the capital injected and to increase the chances for the Dutch State to be satisfactorily remunerated, which the initial conditions did not in any event guarantee.</p>

            <p>In the second place, the FIH Group relies upon the judgments of 5 June 2012, Commission v EDF ( C‑124/10 P, EU:C:2012:318), and of 24 January 2013, Frucona Košice v Commission ( C‑73/11 P, EU:C:2013:32), in support of the argument that, in essence, the fiscal nature of a debt owed to the State by an undertaking, even if it is related to the exercise of public authority powers, does not preclude the application of the private operator principle in the assessment, under Article 107(1) TFEU, of a measure by which the State grants that undertaking a restructuring of the debt.</p>

          <content eId="para_7538__content">
            <p>In that regard, it should be noted that the case-law cited in the previous paragraph is relevant as regards the applicability of the private operator principle but not the application of that principle in a particular case (see, to that effect, judgments of 5 June 2012, Commission v EDF, C‑124/10 P, EU:C:2012:318, paragraph 100, and of 24 October 2013, Land Burgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C‑223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraph 51).</p>

          <content eId="para_7539__content">
            <p>It follows that that case-law in no way affects the finding, made in paragraphs 57 to 59 above, that the risks to which a Member State is exposed because of a debt originating from the grant of State aid to an undertaking, where those risks are inextricably linked to its role as a public authority, cannot be taken into account when the private operator principle is applied to a subsequent measure adopted by that Member State in support of that undertaking.</p>

            <p>In the third and last place, as regards the proper management of public funds, the FIH Group's submission, in essence, that the application of the private operator principle in the contested decision has the consequence that the economic exposure of a Member State resulting from the earlier grant of State aid and its desire to protect its economic interests may not be taken into account in the context of the review under Article 107 TFEU, cannot be accepted.</p>

            <p>While it is true that such considerations are not taken into account in the assessment, under Article 107(1) TFEU, of the existence of State aid, the fact remains that, as the Commission pointed out at the hearing before this Court and as the Advocate General noted in points 81 and 83 of his Opinion, such considerations may be taken into account by the Commission in the assessment, under Article 107(3) TFEU, of the compatibility of any subsequent aid measure with the internal market and may therefore lead the Commission to find, as in the present case, that the measure is compatible.</p>
