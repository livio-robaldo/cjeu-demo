            <p>According to its first recital, Directive 90/434 seeks to ensure that operations involving the restructuring of companies of different Member States, such as mergers, divisions, transfers of assets and exchanges of shares, are not hampered by restrictions, disadvantages or distortions arising in particular from the tax provisions of the Member States.</p>

            <p>On 26 November 2004, Cairnbulg, a company governed by French law, was wound up, without going into liquidation, by and for the benefit of its sole shareholder, Euro Park, a company governed by Luxembourg law. At that time, Cairnbulg opted in its profit and loss account, signed on 25 January 2005 for the financial year ending 26 November 2004, for the special system for mergers provided for in Article 210 A et seq. of the CGI. Consequently, it did not declare, for the purposes of corporation tax, the net capital gains and profits generated by the assets which it had transferred to Euro Park.</p>

            <p>By notarised deed of 19 April 2005, the assets of Cairnbulg were valued at their net accounting value, in the event EUR 9387700. On the same date, those assets were transferred by Euro Park to SCI IBC Ferrier for EUR 15776000, corresponding to the market value of those assets as at 26 November 2004.</p>

            <p>Following an inspection, the tax authority called into question the use of the special system for mergers on the grounds, first, that Cairnbulg had not sought the ministerial approval provided for under Article 210 C of the CGI and, secondly, that that approval would not, in any event, have been granted, since that operation was not justified by commercial reasons but had been carried out for the purpose of tax evasion or avoidance. Consequently, Euro Park, which had assumed the rights and obligations of Cairnbulg, was made liable for additional tax and tax contributions together with the penalties laid down in the CGI in the event of a deliberate infringement.</p>

            <p>Euro Park requested the tribunal administratif de Paris (Administrative Court, Paris, France) to order the cancellation of those taxes and penalties. As that court rejected Euro Park's request, the latter appealed to the cour administrative d'appel de Paris (Administrative Court of Appeal, Paris, France), which upheld that rejection.</p>

            <p>Euro Park then brought an appeal in cassation before the Conseil d'État (Council of State, France), arguing that, by making only transfers made to non-resident legal persons, and not transfers made to resident legal persons, subject to a process of prior approval, Article 210 C(2) of the CGI introduced an unjustified restriction of Article 49 TFEU and, therefore, of the principle of the freedom of establishment.</p>

                <p>If so, must the provisions of Article 49 TFEU be interpreted as precluding national legislation, aimed at preventing tax evasion or avoidance, from imposing a condition that the use of the common system of taxation applicable to mergers and transactions treated as such is to be subject to a process of prior approval only as regards transfers made to foreign legal persons, but not transfers made to legal persons incorporated under national law?'</p>

                </tblock>
                <p>18 By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether EU law allows the assessment of the compatibility of national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, in the light of primary law, when that legislation was adopted to transpose into national law the option provided for in Article 11(1)(a) of Directive 90/434.</p>

            <p>In accordance with settled case-law, any national measure in an area which has been the subject of exhaustive harmonisation at the level of the European Union must be assessed in the light of the provisions of that harmonising measure, and not in the light of the provisions of primary law (judgment of 12 November 2015, Visnapuu, C‑198/14, EU:C:2015:751, paragraph 40 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_2266__content">
            <p>First of all, as is apparent from that wording, that provision allows Member States to refuse to apply or withdraw the benefit of all or part of the provisions of that directive only where the operation coming within its scope, such as a merger involving the companies of various Member States (a cross-border merger), has as its principal objective, or one of its principal objectives, tax evasion or tax avoidance (see, to that effect, judgment of 17 July 1997, Leur-Bloem, C‑28/95, EU:C:1997:369, paragraph 38).</p>

          <num>23</num>
          <content eId="para_2267__content">
            <p>Next, as part of that reservation of competence, Article 11(1)(a) of Directive 90/434 allows the Member States to provide for a presumption of tax evasion or tax avoidance in cases where the merger is not carried out for valid commercial reasons (see, to that effect, judgment of 17 July 1997, Leur-Bloem, C‑28/95, EU:C:1997:369, paragraph 39).</p>

          <num>24</num>
          <content eId="para_2268__content">
            <p>Lastly, concerning the exercise of that option and the application of that presumption, it is apparent from the case-law of the Court that, in the absence of more detailed EU law provisions in that regard, it is for the Member States, observing the principle of proportionality, to determine the provisions needed for the purposes of applying Article 11(1)(a) of Directive 90/434 (see, to that effect, judgment of 17 July 1997, Leur-Bloem, C‑28/95, EU:C:1997:369, paragraph 43).</p>

          <num>25</num>
          <content eId="para_2269__content">
            <p>In those circumstances, it must be held that that provision is not intended, as regards the measures designed to counter tax evasion and avoidance, to achieve exhaustive harmonisation at EU level.</p>

          <content eId="para_2270__content">
            <p>Consequently, the answer to the first question is that, in so far as Article 11(1)(a) of Directive 90/434 does not carry out exhaustive harmonisation, EU law allows for the assessment of the compatibility of national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, in the light of primary law, where that legislation was adopted to transpose into national law the option provided for in that provision.</p>
            <tblock>
              <p>The second question</p>
            </tblock>
            <p>27 By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 49 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which, in the case of a cross-border merger, subjects the granting of the tax concessions applicable to such a transaction pursuant to Directive 90/434, in the present case the deferral of the taxation of capital gains relating to the assets transferred by a French company to a company established in another Member State, to a process of prior approval under which, in order to obtain that approval, the taxpayer must show that the operation concerned is justified on economic grounds, that it does not have as its principal objective, or as one of its principal objectives, tax evasion or avoidance, and that its terms make it possible for the capital gains deferred for tax purposes to be taxed in the future, whereas in a national merger such a deferral is granted without the taxpayer being made subject to such a process.</p>

At the hearing, while confirming that that was the case, the French Government, in referring to the practice applied by the tax authorities, provided some details concerning those rules. In that regard, that government stated that, although that legislation sets out three conditions for obtaining prior approval, according to the practice applied by the tax authority, it is sufficient for the grant of approval that the single condition of the existence of a commercial reason is fulfilled. Furthermore, that government stated that, according to the same practice, the process of prior approval does not suspend the cross-border merger. Accordingly, that operation, to the extent that an application for approval was submitted before it took place, may be carried out before the tax authority's agreement is obtained.</p>

            <p>Since that provision provides an exception to the general rules laid down by Directive 90/434, namely the common tax rules applicable to operations coming within the scope of that same directive, it must be subject to strict interpretation (see, to that effect, judgment of 20 May 2010, Modehuis A.

            <p>First, it should be pointed out that, in the present case, while Directive 90/434 lays down as a principle the deferral of taxation of the capital gains relating to the assets transferred and allows that deferral to be refused only on one condition, namely when the planned operation has as its objective tax evasion or tax avoidance (see, to that effect, judgment of 17 July 1997, Leur-Bloem, C‑28/95, EU:C:1997:369, paragraph 45), the legislation at issue in the main proceedings refuses in a general way to grant that deferral unless the taxpayer first complies with the procedural and substantive requirements under that legislation.</p>

            <p>Secondly, in so far as that legislation makes the grant of that advantage subject to the three conditions referred to in paragraph 32 above, it extends, as the Advocate General noted in points 34 to 36 of his Opinion, the scope of the reservation of competence of the Member States, referred to in paragraphs 22 and 23 above, beyond what is provided for in Article 11(1)(a) of Directive 90/434.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, concerning the presumption of tax evasion or tax avoidance under Article 11(1)(a) of Directive 90/434, it should be recalled that that provision authorises Member States to provide for a presumption of tax evasion or tax avoidance only where the planned operation has the sole objective of obtaining a tax advantage and is thus not carried out for valid commercial reasons (see, to that effect, judgments of 17 July 1997, Leur-Bloem, C‑28/95, EU:C:1997:369, paragraph 45, and of 10 November 2011, Foggia -- Sociedade Gestora de Participações Sociais, C‑126/10, EU:C:2011:718, paragraph 36).</p>

          <content eId="para_2297__content">
            <p>Fifthly, it follows from the Court's case-law that Member States may not, in transposing Article 11(1)(a) of Directive 90/434, have recourse to a general presumption of tax evasion or tax avoidance.</p>

          <content eId="para_2298__content">
            <p>The Court has already held, in that regard, that, in order to determine whether the operation concerned pursues the objective of tax evasion or avoidance, the competent national authorities may not confine themselves to applying predetermined general criteria but must subject each particular case to a general examination of that operation, since the imposition of a general rule automatically excluding certain categories of operations from the tax advantage, without account being taken of whether or not there is actually tax evasion or avoidance, would go further than is necessary for preventing such tax evasion or avoidance and would undermine the objective pursued by that directive (judgment of 10 November 2011, Foggia -- Sociedade Gestora de Participações Sociais, C‑126/10, EU:C:2011:718, paragraph 37).</p>

            <p>Such a restriction is permissible only if it is justified by overriding reasons in the public interest recognised by EU law. It is further necessary, in such a case, that it should be appropriate to ensuring the attainment of the objective in question and not go beyond what is necessary to attain that objective (judgment of 29 November 2011, National Grid Indus, C‑371/10, EU:C:2011:785, paragraph 42 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>According to the French Government, the obstacle in question in the main proceedings is justified by the overriding public interest reason linked to preventing tax evasion or tax avoidance and that of protecting the balanced allocation of the power to impose taxes between the Member States.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be borne in mind that the Court has already held that prevention of tax evasion is an overriding reason relating to the public interest, capable of justifying a restriction on the exercise of freedom of movement guaranteed by the Treaty, as is the need to safeguard the balanced allocation between the Member States of the power to impose taxes (judgment of 5 July 2012, SIAT, C‑318/10, EU:C:2012:415, paragraphs 36 and 37 and the case-law cited.).</p>

            <p>As is clear from the case-law of the Court, it follows from the fourth and sixth recitals of that directive that it establishes only a system of deferral of the taxation of the capital gains relating to the assets transferred, which, while avoiding taxation arising from the business transfer itself, safeguards the financial interests of the State of the transferring company while ensuring taxation of those capital gains at the date of their actual disposal (judgment of 19 December 2012, 3D I, C‑207/11, EU:C:2012:818, paragraph 28).</p>

            <p>With regard to the overriding reason in the public interest in preventing tax avoidance and tax evasion, suffice it to note, as the Advocate General observed in points 72 and 73 of his Opinion, that that objective has the same scope whether it is relied on under Article 11(1)(a) of Directive 90/434 or as justification for an exception to primary law. Therefore, the considerations set out in paragraphs 54 to 56 above, concerning the proportionality of the legislation at issue in the main proceedings and relating to that provision, also apply to the analysis of the proportionality of that legislation in relation to the freedom of establishment. It follows that tax legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which introduces a general presumption of tax evasion or tax avoidance, goes beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective and cannot, therefore, justify an obstacle to that freedom.</p>

            <p>In the light of all of the foregoing, the answer to the second question referred is that Article 49 TFEU and Article 11(1)(a) of Directive 90/434 must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which, in the case of a cross-border merger, makes the granting of the tax advantages applicable to such an operation under that directive, in the present case the deferral of the taxation of the capital gains relating to the assets transferred by a French company to a company established in another Member State, subject to a process of prior approval under which, in order to obtain that approval, the taxpayer must show that the operation concerned is justified for commercial reasons, that it does not have as its principal objective, or as one of its principal objectives, tax evasion or tax avoidance, and that its terms make it possible for the capital gains deferred for tax purposes to be taxed in the future, whereas in the case of a national merger such a deferral is granted without the taxpayer being made subject to such a process.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules: 1. In so far as Article 11(1)(a) of Council Directive 90/434/EEC of 23 July 1990 on the common system of taxation applicable to mergers, divisions, transfers of assets and exchanges of shares concerning companies of different Member States does not carry out exhaustive harmonisation, EU law allows for the assessment of the compatibility of national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, in the light of primary law, where that legislation was adopted to transpose into national law the option provided for in that provision. 2. Article 49 TFEU and Article 11(1)(a) of Directive 90/434 must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which, in the case of a cross-border merger, makes the granting of the tax advantages applicable to such an operation under that directive, in the present case the deferral of the taxation of the capital gains relating to the assets transferred by a French company to a company established in another Member State, subject to a process of prior approval under which, in order to obtain that approval, the taxpayer must show that the operation concerned is justified for commercial reasons, that it does not have as its principal objective, or as one of its principal objectives, tax evasion or tax avoidance and that its terms make it possible for the capital gains deferred for tax purposes to be taxed in the future, whereas in the case of a national merger such a deferral is granted without the taxpayer being made subject to such a process.</p>
