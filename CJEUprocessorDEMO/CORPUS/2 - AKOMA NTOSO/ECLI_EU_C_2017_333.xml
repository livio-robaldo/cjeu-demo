It is to be understood that that right of deduction must, moreover, comply with the rules laid down in Chapter VII of the Law [on VAT] and, in particular, in Articles 50 (general pro rata) and 51 (actual use) thereof. In practice, the taxable person member in question may proceed to deduct the VAT paid by the group or payable by the group only if he is in possession of a statement of account, supported by copies of the invoices, issued to him by the group, setting out the exact net price paid to suppliers, the amount of the tax charged by them or payable by the group and the member's share of the joint expenses and of the tax.'</p>

            <p>The COBMA note is intended to clarify certain matters for the purposes of the practical application of the legal regime applicable to independent groups of persons. It contains, inter alia, the following questions and answers: ` -- Which entity must appear on the invoices to be received from third parties relating to shared costs where the group does not have legal personality? Two possible situations may arise:</p>

                <p>the members have a direct relationship with the third parties and receive from them the goods and services in their names. The members then share the expenses relating to those goods and services received from third parties and on that basis allocate those expenses to the group. That situation may arise, inter alia, where a direct relationship between the group and the third parties may not be entered into for commercial or legal reasons. In the first situation, the invoices issued by third parties relating to shared costs must be clearly addressed to the independent group of persons. Since the group does not have legal personality, the invoices shall be addressed: ``Group ABC / Care of member X - address of member X ''. That member X must allocate the cost (all taxes included) to the group, irrespective of the right of deduction to which that member may be entitled as regards VAT incurred in his own name. Since the group does not have legal personality, at least one of its members must nevertheless be designated as a party legally bound by the payment terms of, and other obligations arising from, the contract. In the second situation, the invoices issued by third parties shall be addressed to one of the members. That member shall then share the expenses relating to those goods and services and allocate those expenses to the group. Those expenses (all taxes included) must be allocated to the group irrespective of the right of deduction to which that member may be entitled as regards VAT incurred in his own name. ... Furthermore, it is hereby clarified that the allocation of shared expenses by the members to the group is a transaction that falls outside the scope of VAT. ...'</p>

Accordingly, the application must be based on the same grounds and pleas as the reasoned opinion. However, that requirement cannot go so far as to mean that in every case the formal statement of complaints in the operative part of the reasoned opinion and the form of order sought in the application must be exactly the same, provided that the subject matter of the proceedings, as defined in the reasoned opinion, has not been extended or altered (judgment of 9 April 2013, Commission v Ireland, C‑85/11, EU:C:2013:217, paragraph 17 and the case-law cited).</p>

The Commission stated clearly, in both the reasoned opinion and in the application, that it considered the Luxembourg legislation to be contrary to Article 2(1)(c) and Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112, since it permits the exemption of the services of an IGP which are not directly necessary for the non-taxable or exempt activities of its members.</p>

The considerations which determine that choice cannot affect the admissibility of the action. The rules laid down in Article 258 TFEU must be applied without any obligation on the Commission to act within a specific period, subject to situations in which the excessive duration of the pre-litigation procedure is liable to make it more difficult for the Member State concerned to refute the Commission's arguments and thus to infringe the rights of the defence. It is for the Member State concerned to adduce evidence that it has been affected by such an excessive duration (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 April 2015, Commission v Germany, C‑591/13, EU:C:2015:230, paragraph 14).</p>

            <p>The Commission observes that Article 1 of the Grand-Ducal Regulation defines the conditions for the application of Article 44(1)(y) of the Law on VAT. Under Article 2(a) and Article 3 of the Grand-Ducal Regulation, the services supplied by an IGP to its members are exempt from VAT provided that the members of that group who also carry out taxable activities generate a turnover excluding tax from those activities of no more than 30%, and even 45% in certain cases, of their total turnover excluding tax. Thus, the Grand-Ducal Regulation does not restrict the exemption from VAT to, solely, the services supplied by the IGP and directly necessary for the activities which are not liable to VAT or which are exempt undertaken by its members, contrary to Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112. Accordingly, in so far as those supplies of services do not satisfy the conditions set out in Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112, they ought to be taxed in accordance with Article 2(1) of that directive.</p>

            <p>, the fact, for the members of an IGP, of carrying out an activity which is exempt or in relation to which they are not taxable persons is a sufficient condition for the purposes of the application of the exemption set out in that provision.

In this connection, that Member State submits that the costs shared by the members of an IGP, through the latter, constitute general costs, and that requiring a difference in the treatment of the VAT applicable to the services rendered by the IGP depending on whether they relate to the part attributable to the members' taxable activities or that attributable to the members' exempt activities is unrealistic, in the light of the practical and administrative difficulties and burdens engendered by such a requirement.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, it should be recalled that, according to the settled case-law of the Court, the question whether a Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations must be determined by reference to the situation prevailing in the Member State at the end of the period laid down in the reasoned opinion and that the Court cannot take account of any subsequent changes (judgment of 28 January 2016, Commission v Portugal, C‑398/14, EU:C:2016:61, paragraph 49).</p>

            <p>It is therefore necessary to examine whether the Grand-Ducal Regulation is consistent with Article 2(1)(c) and Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112, in so far as it provides that the services supplied by an IGP to its members are exempt from VAT provided that the members of that group who also carry out taxable activities generate a turnover excluding tax from those activities of no more than 30%, or, in certain cases, even 45%, of their total turnover excluding tax.</p>

            <p>In this connection, it is clear from the settled case-law of the Court that the terms used to specify the exemptions from VAT set out in Article 132 of Directive 2006/112 must be interpreted strictly since those exemptions constitute exceptions to the general principle that all services supplied for consideration by a taxable person are subject to that tax. Nevertheless, the interpretation of those terms must be consistent with the objectives pursued by those exemptions and comply with the requirements of the principle of fiscal neutrality inherent in the common system of VAT. Accordingly, the requirement of strict interpretation does not mean that the terms used to specify the exemptions referred to in Article 132 should be construed in such a way as to deprive the exemptions of their intended effects. It is not the purpose of the case-law of the Court to impose an interpretation which would make the exemptions concerned almost inapplicable in practice (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 December 2008, Stichting Centraal Begeleidingsorgaan voor de Intercollegiale Toetsing, C‑407/07, EU:C:2008:713, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>According to the wording of Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112, under certain conditions, the supply of services by independent groups `of persons, who are carrying on an activity which is exempt from VAT or in relation to which they are not taxable persons' for the purpose of rendering their members the services `directly necessary for the exercise of that activity' is to be exempt. Consequently, it follows from the wording of that provision that it does not provide for an exemption for the supply of services which are not directly necessary for the exercise of an IGP's members' exempt activities or those in relation to which they are not taxable persons.</p>

In particular, the application of that exemption is not restricted to groups whose members exercise exclusively an activity which is exempt from VAT or in relation to which they are not taxable persons. Accordingly, the services rendered by an IGP whose members also carry out taxable activities may qualify for that exemption, but only in so far as those services are directly necessary for those members' exempt activities or activities in relation to which they are not taxable persons.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, it should be noted that it follows from the exemption provided for in Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112 that the IGP is a taxable person in its own right, separate from its members. It is clear from the very wording of that provision that the IGP is independent, and that it therefore carries out its supplies of services independently, within the meaning of Article 9 of Directive 2006/112. Furthermore, if the services supplied by the IGP were not services supplied by a taxable person acting as such, those services would not be subject to VAT, under Article 2(1)(c) of Directive 2006/112. Those services would therefore not be capable of forming the subject matter of an exemption, such as that set out in Article 132(1)(f) of that directive, as the Advocate General has observed in point 50 of her Opinion.</p>

            </p>
            <p>, in which the Court held, in essence, in paragraphs 24 to 26 and 29 of that judgment, that a taxable person who had set up a pension fund in the form of a legally and fiscally separate entity, in accordance with an obligation imposed on that taxable person as an employer by national legislation, was entitled to deduct the VAT he had paid on services relating to the management and operation of that fund. As is apparent from paragraph 25 of that judgment, the taxable person itself in that case had acquired the services in question subject to VAT, for the purpose of the administration of its employees' pensions and the management of the assets of the pension fund set up to safeguard those pensions. It cannot therefore be inferred from that judgment that the members of an IGP are entitled to deduct the VAT on the goods and services acquired by the group, since only the latter may possibly claim a right of deduction of that VAT.</p>

            <p>alleging a breach of the principle of fiscal neutrality must be rejected. In accordance with that principle, the deduction system is meant to relieve the trader entirely of the burden of the VAT payable or paid in the course of all his economic activities (judgment of 15 September 2016, Landkreis Potsdam-Mittelmark, C‑400/15, EU:C:2016:687, paragraph 35). The common system of VAT therefore ensures that all economic activities, provided that they are, in principle, themselves subject to VAT, are taxed in a neutral way (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 October 2015, PPUH Stehcemp, C‑277/14, EU:C:2015:719, paragraph 27).</p>

By contrast, in so far as such an IGP provides services which are not exempt, it must be held that, in accordance with that principle, the group in question, and not its members, is entitled in its own right to deduct the VAT charged on its input transactions.</p>

Consequently, by permitting the members of an IGP to deduct from the VAT which they themselves are liable to pay, on the basis of an invoice drawn up in the name of that group, the VAT invoiced to the latter, the Luxembourg legislation is contrary to Article 178(a) of Directive 2006/112.</p>

It is clear, in particular, from paragraph 81 of that judgment, that, unlike an IGP, which has the status of a taxable person for the purposes of VAT and all the members of which carry out an economic activity, the community at issue in the case which gave rise to the judgment of 21 April 2005, HE ( C‑25/03, EU:C:2005:241), constituted by the co-ownership in fact formed by the spouses, did not itself have the status of a taxable person for the purposes of VAT and only one of the spouses carried out an economic activity.</p>

            <p>The Commission submits that the wording of the COBMA note indicates that the Registration and Land Authority, which is an organ of the State, is the co-author of the document. In addition, it claims that the content of that note confirms that it does not concern mere recommendations or advice for operators, but rather the manner in which the legislation relating to IGPs is to be interpreted and applied in a harmonised way. In any event, the Commission submits that the COBMA note sets out the general practice of the Luxembourg tax authorities.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, that provision creates the legal fiction of two identical supplies of services provided consecutively.
