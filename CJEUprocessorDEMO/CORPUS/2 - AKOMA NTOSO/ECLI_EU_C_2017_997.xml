Therefore, the case in the main proceedings is governed by the provisions of Directive 75/363 until 15 April 1993, the date on which its repeal by Directive 93/16 took effect, and by the provisions of that latter directive as of that date.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, it must be noted that, in accordance with Article 168(7) TFEU, as interpreted in the case-law of the Court, EU law does not detract from the power of the Member States to adopt provisions aimed at organising their health services. In exercising that power, however, the Member States must comply with EU law, in particular the provisions of TFEU on the freedom of establishment, which prohibit the Member States from introducing or maintaining unjustified restrictions of the exercise of that freedom in the health care sector (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 September 2017, Malta Dental Technologists Association and Reynaud, C‑125/16, EU:C:2017:707, paragraph 54 and the case-law cited).</p>

In addition, neither the decision to refer nor the file before the Court makes it possible to establish whether Ms Simma Federspiel practises as an employed doctor in Austria or as a self-employed professional and, therefore, whether the situation covered by the dispute in the main proceedings falls within the scope of freedom of movement for workers, set out in Article 45 TFEU or freedom of establishment laid down in Article 49 TFEU. Consequently, legislation such as that at issue in the main proceedings must be examined in the light of both Article 45 TFEU and Article 49 TFEU.</p>

            <p>According to the settled case-law of the Court, all the provisions of the Treaty on freedom of movement for persons are intended to facilitate the pursuit by Union nationals of occupational activities of all kinds throughout the EU, and preclude measures that might place Union nationals at a disadvantage when they wish to pursue an activity in the territory of a Member State other than their Member State of origin. In that context, nationals of the Member States have in particular the right, which they derive directly from the Treaty, to leave their Member State of origin to enter the territory of another Member State and reside there in order to pursue an activity there. As a result, Article 45 TFEU precludes any national measure which is capable of hindering or rendering less attractive the exercise by Union nationals of the fundamental freedoms guaranteed by that article (see, to that effect, judgment of 18 July 2017, Erzberger, C‑566/15, EU:C:2017:562, paragraph 33 and the case-law cited). The same is true of restrictions of the freedom of establishment laid down in Article 49 TFEU (see, to that effect, judgments of 5 December 2013, Venturini and Others, C‑159/12 to C‑161/12, EU:C:2013:791, paragraph 30, and of 5 April 2017, Borta, C‑298/15, EU:C:2017:266, paragraph 47 and the case-law cited).</p>

Indeed, that doctor will be deterred from leaving his Member State of origin to work or establish himself in another Member State, if that leads him to repay up to 70% of the amount of the bursary received, together with interest (see, by analogy, judgment of 8 November 2012, Radziejewski, C‑461/11, EU:C:2012:704, paragraph 31).</p>

This thus applies to measures that, on the one hand, meet the objective of guaranteeing in the territory of the Member State concerned sufficient and permanent access to a balanced range of high-quality medical treatment and, on the other, are intended to ensure cost efficiency and prevention, as far as possible, of any wastage of financial, technical and human resources (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 January 2016, CASTA and Others, C‑50/14, EU:C:2016:56, paragraph 60 and paragraph 61).</p>

Since that level may vary from one Member State to another, Member States must be allowed a measure of discretion in that area (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 September 2017, Malta Dental Technologists Association and Reynaud, C‑125/16, EU:C:2017:707, paragraph 60).</p>

Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 2(1)(c) of Council Directive 75/363/EEC of 16 June 1975 concerning the coordination of provisions laid down by law, regulation or administrative action in respect of activities of doctors, as amended by Council Directive 82/76/EEC of 26 January 1982, as well as Article 24(1)(c) of Council Directive 93/16/EEC of 5 April 1993 to facilitate the free movement of doctors and the mutual recognition of their diplomas, certificates and other evidence of formal qualifications must be interpreted as not precluding the legislation of a Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, in accordance with which the disbursement of a national bursary intended to fund training given in another Member State, leading to qualification as a specialist doctor, is conditional upon the recipient doctor practising his profession in that first Member State for a period of 5 years over a 10-year period following completion of the specialisation or, failing that, upon his repayment of up to 70% of the amount of the bursary received, together with interest. 2. Articles 45 and 49 TFEU must be interpreted as not precluding the legislation of a Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, in accordance with which the disbursement of a national bursary intended to fund training given in another Member State, leading to qualification as a specialist doctor, is conditional upon the recipient doctor practising his profession in that first Member State for a period of 5 years over a 10-year period following completion of the specialisation or, failing that, upon his repayment of up to 70% of the amount of the bursary received, together with interest, unless the measures laid down by that legislation do not actually contribute to the pursuit of the objectives of protection of public health and of the financial equilibrium of the social security system and go beyond what is necessary in that regard, which is a matter for the referring court to assess.</p>
