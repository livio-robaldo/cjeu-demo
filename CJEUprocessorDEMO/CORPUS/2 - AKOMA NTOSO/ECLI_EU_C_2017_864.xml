            <p>By its three questions, which it is appropriate to consider together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether it is contrary to Article 168(a) and Article 169(a) of Directive 2006/112 for legislation of a Member State to prevent a taxable person, established in the territory of that Member State, from deducting input VAT due or paid in that Member State in respect of services provided by taxable persons established in other Member States and used to provide services in other Member States other than the Member State in which that taxable person is established, on the ground that that taxable person is identified for VAT purposes pursuant to one of the two circumstances referred to in Article 214(1)(d) and (e) of Directive 2006/112.</p>

            <p>First, it is appropriate to point out that subparagraphs (d) and (e) of Article 214(1) of Directive 2006/112 refer, respectively, to the case in which the taxable person receives, in the territory of a Member State, services in respect of which it is liable for VAT pursuant to Article 196 of that directive and to the case in which the taxable person is established in the territory of a Member State and provides, in the territory of another Member State, services in respect of which solely the person to whom those services are provided is liable for VAT pursuant to Article 196. It follows from the decision to refer that that provision was transposed into Bulgarian law in paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 97a of the ZDDS.</p>

            <p>Second, it must be noted that, pursuant to the settled case-law of the Court, the fundamental principle of VAT neutrality requires that deduction of input VAT due or paid be allowed if the substantive requirements are satisfied, even if the taxable person has failed to comply with some of the formal requirements (see judgment of 9 July 2015, Salomie and Oltean, C‑183/14, EU:C:2015:454, paragraph 58 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_3662__content">
            <p>The Court has also held that identification for VAT purposes, provided for in Article 214 of Directive 2006/112, is only a formal requirement for the purposes of control, and cannot undermine, inter alia, the right to deduct VAT in the case where the substantive conditions that give rise to that right are satisfied (judgment of 9 July 2015, Salomie and Oltean, C‑183/14, EU:C:2015:454, paragraph 60 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <num>32</num>
          <content eId="para_3663__content">
            <p>It follows, in particular, that a taxable person for VAT purposes cannot be prevented from exercising his right of deduction in respect of input VAT due or paid on the ground that he was not identified as a taxable person for those purposes before using the goods purchased in the context of his taxed activity (judgment of 9 July 2015, Salomie and Oltean, C‑183/14, EU:C:2015:454, paragraph 61 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_3664__content">
            <p>It also follows, a fortiori, that national legislation cannot prevent a taxable person from exercising its right to deduct input VAT due or paid on the ground that it is identified for VAT purposes pursuant to one of the cases referred to in Article 214(1)(d) and (e) of Directive 2006/112.</p>

            <p>Taking into account the foregoing, the answer to the questions referred is that Directive 2006/112 must be interpreted as precluding legislation of a Member State that prevents a taxable person, established in the territory of that Member State, deducting input VAT due or paid in that Member State in respect of services provided by taxable persons established in other Member States and used to provide services in Member States other than the Member State in which that taxable person is established, on the ground that that taxable person is identified for VAT purposes pursuant to one of the two circumstances referred to in Article 214(1)(d) and (e) of Directive 2006/112.</p>

            <p>It follows from the decision to refer that, since EBS was no longer eligible for the tax exemption scheme in Bulgaria, given the amount of its turnover, it could no longer be identified for VAT purposes under paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 97a of the ZDDS, but had, on the other hand, to fall within the `mandatory' registration scheme in accordance with Article 96 of the ZDDS.</p>

            <p>It appears, therefore, to follow from the foregoing that only taxable persons subject to the tax exemption scheme in Bulgaria can be identified for VAT under paragraphs 1 and 2 of Article 97a of the ZDDS.</p>

            <p>If that is the case, which it is for the referring court to determine, it alone having jurisdiction to interpret national law, it would be appropriate to reformulate the questions referred and find that they relate, in essence, to the question whether Article 168(a) and Article 169(a) of Directive 2006/112 preclude legislation of a Member State that prevents a taxable person, established in a territory of that Member State and eligible there for a tax exemption scheme, exercising its right to deduct input VAT due or paid in that Member State for services provided by taxable persons established in other Member States and used to provide services in Member States other than the Member State in which that taxable person is established.</p>

          <content eId="para_3670__content">
            <p>In that regard, it must be pointed out that Article 168(a) of Directive 2006/112 provides that, in so far as the goods and services are used for the purposes of the taxed transactions of a taxable person, the taxable person is to be entitled, in the Member State in which he carries out those transactions, to deduct, from the VAT which he is liable to pay, the VAT due or paid in that Member State in respect of supplies to him of goods or services, carried out or to be carried out by another taxable person.</p>

            <p>However, an undertaking established in the territory of a Member State and eligible for a tax exemption scheme in that Member State could not rely on a right to deduct input VAT due or paid under that provision. Article 289 of Directive 2006/112 provides that taxable persons subject to that tax exemption scheme `shall not be entitled to deduct VAT in accordance with Articles 167 to 171 ... and may not show the VAT on their invoices.'</p>

          <content eId="para_3672__content">
            <p>Further, Article 169(a) of Directive 2006/112 states that, in addition to the deduction referred to in Article 168 of that directive, the taxable person is to be entitled to deduct the VAT referred to therein in so far as the goods and services are used for transactions relating to the activities referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 9(1) of the same directive, carried out outside the Member State in which that tax is due or paid, in respect of which VAT would be deductible if those transactions had been carried out within that Member State.</p>

            <p>Pursuant to Article 169(a) of Directive 2006/112, the right to deduct therefore depends on whether that right exists where all of those transactions are carried out within the territory of the same Member State (see, by analogy, judgment of 22 December 2010, RBS Deutschland Holdings, C‑277/09, EU:C:2010:810, paragraph 32). The Court has held, in that regard, that the right to deduct may be applied regardless of whether or not the output transaction is subject to a payment of VAT in other Member States (see also, by analogy, judgment of 22 December 2010, RBS Deutschland Holdings, C‑277/09, EU:C:2010:810, paragraph 41).</p>

            <p>However, as an undertaking eligible for the benefit of a tax exemption scheme in Bulgaria could not rely, in that Member State, on a right to deduct input VAT due or paid for services provided in that Member State, one of the conditions set out in Article 169(a) of Directive 2006/112 for eligibility for the right to deduct input VAT due or paid for services provided outside that Member State would not be fulfilled either.</p>

            <p>It therefore must be held that Article 168(a) and Article 169(a) of Directive 2006/112 must be interpreted as meaning that they do not preclude legislation of a Member State that prevents a taxable person, established in the territory of a Member State and eligible for a tax exemption scheme there, exercising its right to deduct input VAT due or paid in that Member State for services provided by taxable persons established in other Member States and used to provide services in Member States other than the Member State in which that taxable person is established.</p>

            <p>Taking into account all of the considerations set out above, the answer to the questions referred is that Directive 2006/112 must be interpreted as meaning that it does preclude Member State legislation that prevents a taxable person, established in the territory of that Member State, deducting input VAT due or paid in that Member State in respect of services provided by taxable persons established in other Member States and used to provide services in Member States other than the Member State in which that taxable person is established, on the ground that that taxable person is identified for VAT purposes by virtue of one of the two cases referred to in Article 214(1)(d) and (e) of Directive 2006/112. However, Article 168(a) and Article 169(a) of Directive 2006/112 must be interpreted as meaning that they do not preclude legislation of a Member State that prevents a taxable person, established in the territory of that Member State and eligible there for a tax exemption scheme, exercising its right to deduct input VAT due or paid in that Member State for services provided by taxable persons established in other Member States and used to provide services in Member States other than the Member State in which that taxable person is established.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable.

However, Article 168(a) and Article 169(a) of Directive 2006/112, as amended by Directive 2009/162, must be interpreted as meaning that they do not preclude legislation of a Member State that prevents a taxable person, established in the territory of that Member State and eligible there for a tax exemption scheme, exercising its right to deduct input value added tax due or paid in that Member State for services provided by taxable persons established in other Member States and used to provide services in Member States other than the Member State in which that taxable person is established.</p>
