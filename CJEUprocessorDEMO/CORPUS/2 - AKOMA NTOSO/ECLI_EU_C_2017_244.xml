            <p>Furthermore, it is established that Member States may adopt implementing measures for a regulation provided that they do not thereby obstruct its direct applicability or conceal its nature as an act of EU law; that they specify that they are acting in exercise of a discretion conferred on them under that regulation; and that they adhere to the parameters laid down thereunder (judgments of 25 October 2012, Ketelä, C‑592/11, EU:C:2012:673, paragraph 36; of 15 May 2014, Szatmári Malom, C‑135/13, EU:C:2014:327, paragraph 55; and of 7 July 2016, Občina Gorje, C‑111/15, EU:C:2016:532, paragraph 35).</p>

            <p>It is by referring to the relevant provisions of the regulation concerned, interpreted in the light of the objectives of that regulation, that it may be determined whether they prohibit, require or allow Member States to adopt certain implementing measures and, particularly in the latter case, whether the measure concerned comes within the scope of the discretion that each Member State is recognised as having (judgments of 25 October 2012, Ketelä, C‑592/11, EU:C:2012:673, paragraph 37, and of 7 July 2016, Občina Gorje, C‑111/15, EU:C:2016:532, paragraph 36).</p>

            <p>In the present case, Regulation No 1698/2005 and Regulation No 1974/2006 do not lay down rules on the payment of the support provided for in Article 36(b)(iv) of Regulation No 1698/2005 when a Natura 2000 forest area is owned both by the State and by private owners. Article 42(1) of Regulation No 1698/2005 establishes the principle that Natura 2000 support payments are to be granted for forests and wooded areas owned by private owners or their associations or by municipalities or their associations. Regulation No 1974/2006 laying down detailed rules for the application of Regulation No 1698/2005 sets out, in Article 30(4)(a) thereof, the limits of that principle, stating that forests and other wooded land owned by central or regional governments, or by government-owned corporations are to be excluded from the scope of Article 42(1) of Regulation No 1698/2005.</p>

            <p>Given that, first, under Article 7 of Regulation No 1698/2005, Member States are responsible for implementing rural development programmes and, secondly, in accordance with Article 50(1) and (7) of that regulation, the Natura 2000 forest areas eligible for the support provided for in Article 36(b)(iv) of that regulation are to be designated, in accordance with Directives 79/409 and 92/43, by the Member States, it must be determined whether, as the Hungarian Government submits, the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings merely establishes the rules for setting the amounts of the support available under that provision.</p>

            <p>In this case, the interpretation of the first sentence of Article 42(1) of Regulation No 1698/2005 which follows from the national legislation leads, in particular in the circumstances of the main proceedings, to a reversal of the relationship between the rule laid down by that provision and the exception set out in Article 30(4)(a) of Regulation No 1974/2006. The principle established in Article 42(1) of Regulation No 1698/2005 is that Natura 2000 support is to be paid to private owners and their associations. However, in the circumstances of the main proceedings, even though only a negligible part of the forest area in question is owned by the State, the refusal to pay any support to the private owner who owns most of that area effectively makes the exception the rule.</p>

          <num>23</num>
          <content eId="para_4584__content">
            <p>Accordingly, an interpretation of those provisions that would lead to the complete exclusion of a forest area from the Natura 2000 support scheme on the ground that a part of that area is owned by the State would run counter to the very wording of Article 42(1) of Regulation No 1698/2005, which lays down the principle that support is to be granted for forests and wooded land owned by private owners or their associations.</p>

          <content eId="para_4585__content">
            <p>Moreover, as is apparent from Article 30(4)(a) of Regulation No 1974/2006, forests and other wooded land owned, inter alia, by the State are excluded from the scope of the first sentence of Article 42(1) of Regulation No 1698/2005. However, since the application of the national legislation implementing Article 30(4)(a) of Regulation No 1974/2006 leads to the exclusion of a Natura 2000 forest area in its entirety from the scope of the first sentence of Article 42(1) of Regulation No 1698/2005, even though almost all of that area falls within that scope, that interpretation calls into question the very definition of that scope.</p>

          <num>25</num>
          <content eId="para_4586__content">
            <p>Since such a radical consequence of the mixed ownership of a Natura 2000 forest area is not expressly provided for by Regulation No 1698/2005 or Regulation No 1974/2006, such a measure cannot fall within the ambit of the discretion enjoyed by each Member State for the implementation of Natura 2000 payments.</p>

            <p>As regards, in the second place, the inferences to be drawn from the mixed ownership of a Natura 2000 forest area, it must be borne in mind, first, that, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation No 1698/2005, Natura 2000 support is intended to compensate for costs incurred and income foregone resulting from the restrictions on the use of forests and other wooded land due to the implementation of Directive 79/409 and Directive 92/43.</p>

            <p>The fact that part of a plot of a Natura 2000 forest area does not fall within the scope of Natura 2000 support, on that ground that it is owned by the State, does not eliminate the need to compensate for the restrictions on the use of plots in that area belonging to a private owner as a result of the implementation of the requirements set out in those directives.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, the complete exclusion of a Natura 2000 forest area owned both by a private owner and by the State from the scope of the first sentence of Article 42(1) of Regulation No 1698/2005 would necessarily eliminate the compensatory aim of the Natura 2000 payments system.</p>

            <p>Secondly, the national provisions adopted by the Member State in the exercise of its power to implement EU legislation must observe the general principles of EU law, in particular that of proportionality (see, to that effect, as regards fraud prevention, judgment of 28 October 2010, SGS Belgium and Others, C‑367/09, EU:C:2010:648, paragraph 40).</p>

            <p>Although, by excluding land owned by the State from entitlement to Natura 2000 support, the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings and the interpretation of that legislation effectively implement the exception laid down in Article 30(4)(a) of Regulation No 1974/2006, completely excluding a forest area from Natura 2000 support because part of that area, irrespective of its size, is owned by the State does not reflect the actual ownership ratio proportionately.</p>

            <p>It is apparent from the order for reference that, even though 99.818% of the forest area in question in the main proceedings falls within the scope of the first sentence of Article 42(1) of Regulation No 1698/2005, the entire area is excluded from Natura 2000 payments on the ground that 0.182% of that area does not fall within that scope.</p>

            <p>Consequently, the exclusion of only the plot or hectare owned in part by the State from Natura 2000 compensatory support for a forest area eligible for such support -- or even no exclusion at all if that part is negligible -- would comply with the principle of proportionality, unlike the complete exclusion of that area without any regard being had to the ratio of the size of the part of that area owned by the State to the size of the part owned by the private owner.</p>

            <p>It follows from all the foregoing considerations that the answer to the questions referred is that the first sentence of Article 42(1) of Regulation No 1698/2005 must be interpreted as meaning that, when a forest area eligible for Natura 2000 support is owned in part by the State and in part by a private owner, account must be taken of the ratio of the size of the part owned by the State to the size of the part owned by that private owner in calculating the amount of support to be paid to the latter.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Tenth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. The first sentence of Article 42(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1698/2005 of 20 September 2005 on support for rural development by the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) must be interpreted as meaning that, when a forest area eligible for Natura 2000 support is owned in part by the State and in part by a private owner, account must be taken of the ratio of the size of the part owned by the State to the size of the part owned by that private owner in calculating the amount of support to be paid to the latter.</p>
