            <p>From 1996 to 2002, Ms Santoro worked as a provider of socially useful services for the municipality of Valderice. She was then employed by that municipality under a continuous and coordinated contractual relationship until the end of 2010. On 4 October 2010 she entered into a part-time contract of employment with that municipality, which was due to end on 31 December 2012. The contract was extended three times until 31 December 2016, that is, for a total period of four years.</p>

            <p>Ms Santoro brought an action before the Tribunale di Trapani (District Court, Trapani, Italy), seeking inter alia a declaration that those fixed-term contracts were unlawful, an order that the municipality of Valderice compensate in kind the loss suffered, by ordering the establishment of an employment relationship of indefinite duration, and, in the alternative, an order that the municipality award her financial compensation for that loss by compensating her and by granting her treatment, in legal terms, identical to that of a worker of that municipality employed for an indefinite period and having the same length of service as her.</p>

            <p>In accordance with Article 36(5) of Legislative Decree No 165/2001, infringement by the public authorities of the prohibition on repeated conclusion of fixed-term employment contracts cannot lead to conversion of those contracts into a contract of indefinite duration. Consequently, workers such as Ms Santoro would be able to seek only compensation for the loss they have suffered, which, under Article 32(5) of Law No 183/2010, would be limited to payment of overall compensation of between 2.5 and 12 times the worker's last actual overall monthly salary payment. According to the findings of the referring court, such compensation would replace only the income that would have been received `pending' a successful outcome for the worker.</p>

            <p>The Tribunale di Genova (District Court, Genoa, Italy) had asked the Court of Justice to rule on the question whether the prohibition on converting successive fixed-term contracts concluded with the public authorities into an employment contract of indefinite duration was compatible with EU law. In the judgment of 7 September 2006, Marrosu and Sardino ( C‑53/04, EU:C:2006:517, paragraph 57), the Court replied to that question that such a prohibition is not incompatible with the clauses of the Framework Agreement, as long as the national legal order of the Member State concerned provides for the application of `another effective measure to prevent and, where relevant, punish the abuse of successive fixed-term contracts by a public sector employer'.</p>

            <p>Following that judgment, the Tribunale di Genova (District Court, Genoa) granted the workers affected not only compensation representing a minimum of five monthly salary payments but also `reinstatement compensation' amounting to 15 times the last actual overall monthly salary payment of those workers. That decision was expressly upheld by the Corte d'appello di Genova (Court of Appeal, Genoa, Italy), which found that it constituted a response to the need to strengthen the protection of public sector workers, in accordance with the judgment of 7 September 2006, Marrosu and Sardino ( C‑53/04, EU:C:2006:517).</p>

            <p>However, in its judgment of 15 March 2016 (No 5072/2016), the Corte suprema di cassazione (Court of Cassation, Italy) held that, in cases of use of fixed-term contracts by a public authority, use which is unlawful due to the prohibition referred to in Article 36(1) of Legislative Decree No 165/2001, apart from the application of redress mechanisms against the managers responsible, it is merely envisaged that a worker who has been harmed is entitled, in addition to the lump sum compensation referred to in the previous paragraph, to compensation for `loss of opportunity'. The loss of opportunity stems from the fact that fixed-term employment may have made `the worker lose other stable employment opportunities'. That court considered that the measure adopted by the Tribunale di Genova (District Court, Genoa) was inappropriate on the ground that a person who concludes a contract with a public authority is not liable to lose a job which can be obtained only following success in a recruitment competition.</p>

The referring court therefore wonders whether the former must benefit from a measure no less favourable than that from which the latter benefit, namely, compensation for the lack of conversion of the fixed-term employment relationship into an employment relationship of indefinite duration.</p>

Consequently, where questions submitted concern the interpretation of EU law, the Court is bound, in principle, to give a ruling (judgment of 12 November 2015, Hewlett-Packard Belgium, C‑572/13, EU:C:2015:750, paragraph 24 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>However, that is not the case here. First, the order for reference sets out the factual and legal context in sufficient detail to enable the scope of the questions referred to be determined. The referring court explains, in that regard, that the applicant in the main proceedings worked for the same employer between 4 October 2010 and 31 December 2016 under successive fixed-term contracts, and it states that the claims made before it are based on the misuse of fixed-term contracts. Second, the request for a preliminary ruling clearly reveals and sets out the reasons that led the referring court to be uncertain as to the interpretation of certain provisions of EU law and to consider it necessary to refer questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling. That court is uncertain whether the compensation provided for in Article 32(5) of Law No 183/2010 constitutes an appropriate measure for compensating for the loss resulting from the misuse of fixed-term contracts and indicates that the answer to that question is necessary for it to rule on the dispute in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>By its questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether clause 5 of the Framework Agreement must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which does not punish the misuse of successive fixed-term contracts by a public sector employer through the payment of compensation to the worker concerned for the lack of conversion of the fixed-term employment relationship into an employment relationship of indefinite duration, but provides for the grant of compensation of between 2.5 and 12 times the last monthly salary of that worker together with the possibility for him to obtain full compensation for the harm by proving the loss of opportunities to find employment or by proving that, if a recruitment competition had been duly organised, he would have been successful.</p>

In that regard, Article 32(5) of Law No 183/2010 provides that, in the event of misuse of fixed-term employment contracts, the court is to order the employer to pay the worker concerned overall compensation of between 2.5 and 12 times his last actual overall monthly salary.</p>

It is impossible, in its view, to prove the loss of the opportunity to pass an administrative competition. Accordingly, the possibility for the worker concerned to demonstrate the existence of harm resulting from such a loss of opportunity is purely theoretical. Thus, it cannot, according to the referring court, be precluded that the provisions of national law governing the assessment of harm may render it practically impossible or excessively difficult for that worker to exercise the rights conferred on him by EU law, and in particular his right to compensation for the harm that he has suffered as a result of the misuse by his former public employer of successive fixed-term employment contracts.</p>

In that context, it is necessary to take into consideration, where relevant, the principles which lie at the basis of the national legal system, such as the protection of the rights of the defence, the principle of legal certainty and the proper conduct of the proceedings (judgments of 21 February 2008, Tele2 Telecommunication, C‑426/05, EU:C:2008:103, paragraph 55 and the case-law cited, and of 29 October 2009, Pontin, C‑63/08, EU:C:2009:666, paragraph 47).</p>

Such an infringement would also be taken into account for the purpose of assessing the work of those managers, who could, due to that breach, not be awarded a performance bonus.

            <p>In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the questions referred is that clause 5 of the Framework Agreement must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which, on the one hand, does not punish the misuse of successive fixed-term contracts by a public sector employer through the payment of compensation to the worker concerned for the lack of conversion of the fixed-term employment relationship into an employment relationship of indefinite duration, but, on the other hand, provides for the grant of compensation of between 2.5 and 12 times the last monthly salary of that worker together with the possibility for him to obtain full compensation for the harm by demonstrating, by way of presumption, the loss of opportunities to find employment or that, if a recruitment competition had been duly organised, he would have been successful, provided that such legislation is accompanied by an effective and dissuasive penalty mechanism, a matter which is for the referring court to verify.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules: Clause 5 of the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded on 18 March 1999, which is set out in the annex to Council Directive 1999/70/EC of 28 June 1999 concerning the framework agreement on fixed-term work concluded by ETUC, UNICE and CEEP, must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which, on the one hand, does not punish the misuse of successive fixed-term contracts by a public sector employer through the payment of compensation to the worker concerned for the lack of conversion of the fixed-term employment relationship into an employment relationship of indefinite duration, but, on the other hand, provides for the grant of compensation of between 2.5 and 12 times the last monthly salary of that worker together with the possibility for him to obtain full compensation for the harm by demonstrating, by way of presumption, the loss of opportunities to find employment or that, if a recruitment competition had been duly organised, he would have been successful, provided that such legislation is accompanied by an effective and dissuasive penalty mechanism, a matter which is for the referring court to verify.</p>
