            <p>On 29 September 2015, INEOS brought an action against that rejection decision before the Verwaltungsgericht Berlin (Administrative Court, Berlin, Germany), arguing, inter alia, that it had inadvertently omitted to submit certain data concerning its direct emissions for 2006 and 2007, wrongly assuming that the DEHSt already had that data, although the installation in question had been subject to the trading scheme for emission allowances only from 1 January 2008. According to INEOS, the DEHSt was under an obligation to ask it to supplement or correct the data provided for the purposes of the allocation application.</p>

However, it is apparent both from the wording of the relevant provisions of Decision 2011/278, in particular Articles 7, 8 and 10, and from the general scheme of that directive and the objective which it pursues that Member States had the obligation to ensure the completeness, correctness and consistency of baseline data collected from operators.

Whilst, admittedly, Directive 2003/87 and Decision 2011/278 have set out a framework for that stage, neither that directive nor that decision has specified the period in which an operator is required to submit its allocation application, let alone the period in which that operator could, where appropriate, correct or supplement the information submitted in support of that application.</p>

            <p>INEOS maintains, however, that it follows from the Member States' obligation to rely, for the purpose of calculating those allowances, on the most precise and fullest possible baseline data, that the competent national authorities are required, with a view to ensuring the effective application of EU law, to set aside any procedural requirement, such as the mandatory time limit at issue in the main proceedings, preventing the correction of inaccurate data.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it is true, as the Court has already pointed out, that the Member States, in accordance with Article 7(7) of Decision 2011/278 read in conjunction with recital 15 of that decision, must ensure that the data collected from the operators and used for free allocation of emission allowances is complete, consistent and presents the highest achievable accuracy (judgment of 8 September 2016, E.ON Kraftwerke, C‑461/15, EU:C:2016:648, paragraphs 27 and 37).</p>

            <p>Similarly, as is already apparent from paragraph 34 above, Article 8(1) of Decision 2011/278 requires Member States to ensure that a verifier has checked `the reliability, credibility and accuracy' of that data with a view to reaching a verification opinion that states with `reasonable assurance' whether there are material misstatements.</p>

            <p>Such a requirement of accuracy is a matter for the Member States, as is apparent both from those provisions and from recital 15 of Decision 2011/278, so that they are able to achieve the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, referred to in paragraphs 26 to 28 above, by a harmonised and consistent application of the allocation rules.</p>

            <p>However, as is clear, inter alia, from the wording of Article 7(7) and (8) of Decision 2011/278, the requirement of accuracy on the part of Member States requires the cooperation of operators and, on that basis, those operators are also required to comply with various obligations including, in particular, communicating complete, consistent data which is as accurate as possible and exercising due diligence.</p>

          <content eId="para_6514__content">
            <p>Those cooperation obligations imposed on operators are therefore clearly intended, as the Federal Environment Agency and the German Government rightly point out, to encourage those operators, since they are the source of the baseline data necessary for the calculation of free emission allowances, to exercise due diligence to ensure the collection of data which is as accurate as possible, so that Member States can themselves fulfil their obligations under Articles 7 and 8 of Decision 2011/278 and thus achieve the objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions pursued by Directive 2003/87.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, as the Advocate General observed in points 93 and 94 of his Opinion, it must be held that the requirement of accuracy is a joint responsibility of operators and Member States and that, therefore, it cannot be held, contrary to what is claimed by INEOS, that these operators derive from Decision 2011/278 any right to the accuracy of data provided for the purposes of calculating free emission allowances that they may assert against their Member State. It follows that the effective application of that decision in no way obliges the competent national authorities to set aside a procedural rule, such as the mandatory time limit at issue in the main proceedings, in order to enable an operator to correct inaccurate data provided by itself within that time limit.</p>

            <p>It follows that there is nothing in the file submitted to the Court to suggest that a mandatory time limit, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, infringes the principle of effectiveness.</p>

            <p>That assessment is all the more compelling in the circumstances of the case in the main proceedings, given that, as is apparent from the information submitted to the Court by the German Government, which has not been challenged by INEOS in that respect, from October 2011 the national competent authorities have repeatedly stated to the operators concerned that in respect of installations which, like that belonging to INEOS at issue in the main proceedings, were subject to the emissions trading system only from 1 January 2008, an additional submission of the relevant data listed in Article 5 of the regulation concerning the allocation of greenhouse gas emission allowances for the trading period 2013 to 2020, from 26 September 2011, was necessary when the baseline period 2005-2008 was chosen.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, it should be noted that, in the present case, the correction of incorrect data in order to obtain additional free emission allowances, if feasible, would take place not only on completion of the first stage, but also after the third and final stage of the procedure, following notification of the contested decision.</p>

            <p>Such a late correction could infringe the principle of legal certainty, since any free allocation of emission allowances could remain provisional indefinitely, as the first stage of the procedure could still be reopened. This would result in a serious disruption of the proper conduct of the allocation procedure of free emission allowances.</p>

            <p>Finally, contrary to INEOS's submission, a different interpretation cannot be inferred from the judgment of 28 April 2016, Borealis Polyolefine and Others ( C‑191/14, C‑192/14, C‑295/14, C‑389/14 and C‑391/14 to C‑393/14, EU:C:2016:311). It is true that, in paragraph 97 of that judgment, the Court held that it was for the Commission to ask the Member States to make the `necessary corrections' to the emission data provided. However, in that case, the error resulted, as is apparent from paragraphs 94 and 95 of that judgment, from the Commission taking into account data sent by the Member States concerning emissions for a period not covered by Article 10a(5)(b) of Directive 2003/87. It is solely because of the seriousness of that error, which substantially affected the uniform cross-sectoral correction factor and, ultimately, the number of allowances to be freely allocated, that the principle of legal certainty did not preclude calling that factor into question ex nunc from the time specified in paragraph 111 of that judgment.</p>

            <p>In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the question referred is that Article 10a of Directive 2003/87 and Decision 2011/278 must be interpreted as meaning that they do not preclude a national provision, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which lays down, for the submission of an application for free allocation of emission allowances for the period 2013-2020, a mandatory time limit after which the applicant has no means of correcting or supplementing its application, since that time limit is not liable to render impossible in practice or excessively difficult the submission of such an application.</p>
