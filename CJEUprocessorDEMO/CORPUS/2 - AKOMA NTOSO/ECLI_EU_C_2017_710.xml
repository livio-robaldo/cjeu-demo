The taking into account of previous convictions handed down in other Member States, as provided for in paragraph 1, shall not have the effect of interfering with, revoking or reviewing previous convictions or any decision relating to their execution by the Member State conducting the new proceedings. 4.

            <p>Those two provisions state, inter alia, that when a person has committed a number of offences before he or she is convicted, of each of those offences, and sentenced by separate convicting judgments to separate sentences, a national court is to impose on that person, for the purposes of execution of those sentences, a single overall sentence corresponding to the highest of the sentences initially imposed. The order for reference indicates, in essence, that in that situation, the highest sentence absorbs the initial more lenient sentences. Further, it follows from those provisions that when one of the initial sentences has already been wholly or partly executed, it is, for the purposes of execution, deducted from the overall sentence if it is of the same kind as the latter.</p>

            <p>(the Sofia public prosecutor, Bulgaria), it is impossible, having regard in particular to Article 4(2) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, to determine an overall sentence that takes into account the sentence imposed by a conviction previously handed down by a court of another Member State unless that judgment has first been recognised by the Bulgarian courts with jurisdiction in accordance with the special procedure for the recognition and execution of convictions handed down by foreign courts, provided for in, in particular, Articles 463 to 466 of that code. In the light of that case-law, the referring court seeks to ascertain, in essence, whether, if the application by Mr Beshkov is to be granted, the conviction before the Landesgericht Klagenfurt (Regional Court of Klagenfurt) must, first, be recognised in accordance with, in particular, Articles 463 to 466, or rather whether, as Mr Beshkov argues, the referring court can or must grant that application, without that conviction having been the subject of such prior recognition, on the basis of Article 8(2) of the Criminal Code, which transposes Framework Decision 2008/675 into Bulgarian law.</p>

            <p>In order to answer that question, that court considers, in essence, that it is necessary to determine whether that Framework Decision applies to a procedure, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, the object of which is the imposition, for the purposes of enforcement, of an overall custodial sentence that takes into account a conviction handed down by a court of another Member State and, more specifically, the sentence imposed on the convicted person by that court.</p>

            <p>In that regard, the referring court states, in essence, that, while, in accordance with the current Bulgarian legislation, any convicted person may bring before the Bulgarian courts with jurisdiction an application for the imposition of an overall sentence pursuant to Articles 23 and 25 of the Criminal Code, the recognition procedure laid down in the relevant provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, in particular, Articles 463 to 466 of that code can, however, be implemented on the initiative of the competent authorities in Bulgaria or those of the State where the first conviction was handed down. It follows that the convicted person cannot, in fact, himself initiate the procedure for the imposition of such an overall sentence that takes into account a previous conviction handed down in another Member State, even where the competent authorities take no action.</p>

            <p>Further, the referring court seeks to ascertain whether Framework Decision 2008/675 precludes, for the purposes of imposing an overall sentence that takes into account the sentence imposed on Mr Beshkov by the Landesgericht Klagenfurt (Regional Court of Klagenfurt), any alteration of the arrangements for enforcing the latter sentence. In this case, since the sentence of 18 months imprisonment, a period of 12 months being suspended, imposed on Mr Beshkov by that court was higher than that imposed by the referring court in its judgment of 29 April 2013, the referring court was bound to apply to Mr Beshkov an overall sentence corresponding to that first sentence. However, in accordance with Article 66(1) of the Criminal Code, Mr Beshkov, who has, in the past, already been convicted on several occasions and sentenced to periods of imprisonment in Bulgaria, can no longer qualify for suspension of sentence in that Member State. Consequently, the referring court would have to alter the arrangements for enforcing the sentence imposed on Mr Beshkov by the Landesgericht Klagenfurt (Regional Court of Klagenfurt) and apply to him an overall sentence of 18 months imprisonment, while deducting the period of six months imprisonment already served in Austria.</p>

            <p>In order to answer that question, it must be observed that Article 1(1) of Framework Decision 2008/675 provides that the purpose of that framework decision is to determine the conditions under which previous convictions handed down in one Member State against a person are taken into account in the course of new criminal proceedings brought in another Member State against the same person and for different facts.</p>

            <p>To that end, Article 3(1) of that Framework Decision, read in the light of recital 5 thereof, obliges Member States to ensure that, when such criminal proceedings are brought, previous convictions handed down in other Member States, in respect of which information has been obtained under applicable instruments on mutual legal assistance or on the exchange of information extracted from criminal records, are taken into account to the extent that previous national convictions are taken into account under national law, and that the legal effects attached to them are equivalent to those attached to previous national convictions, in accordance with national law, whether in relation to questions of fact or questions of substantive or procedural law.</p>

            <p>Article 3(2) of that Framework Decision adds that that obligation is to apply at the pre-trial stage, at the trial stage itself and at the time of execution of the conviction, in particular with regard to the applicable rules of procedure, including the rules relating to the definition of the offence, the type and level of the sentence, and the rules governing the execution of the decision. Thus, recitals 2 and 7 of that Framework Decision state that a national court must be able to take account of convictions handed down in other Member States including how arrangements for enforcement might be implemented and that the effects of those convictions should be equivalent to the effects of national decisions at each of those procedural stages.</p>

            <p>It follows that Framework Decision 2008/675 is applicable not only to proceedings concerned with establishing that an accused person is or is not guilty of an offence, but also to proceedings relating to the enforcement of the sentence where account must be taken of a sentence imposed following a previous conviction handed down in another Member State. As the Advocate General stated in point 59 of his Opinion, it is apparent from the documents available to the Court that, in this case, the proceedings seeking the imposition of an overall sentence brought by Mr Beshkov fall into the second category, and consequently that procedure falls within the scope of that Framework Decision.</p>

            <p>30 First, it must be observed, as stated in paragraph 18 of the present judgment, that the referring court questions whether it is a prerequisite of the possibility that the conviction handed down by the Landesgericht Klagenfurt (Regional Court of Klagenfurt) at issue in the main proceedings might be taken into account for the imposition of an overall sentence, that that conviction must first be recognised by the Bulgarian courts with jurisdiction in accordance with the procedure laid down in, in particular, Articles 463 to 466 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.</p>

            <p>As was stated in paragraphs 20 and 21 of this judgment, the referring court, while expressing some doubts, nonetheless starts from the premiss that that prior recognition procedure should be implemented for that purpose and raises the issue, by means of its second question, of whether Framework Decision 2008/675 precludes the abovementioned Articles 463 to 466 in so far as those articles provide that that procedure cannot be initiated directly by the convicted person.</p>

            <p>However, in order to provide a useful answer to the referring court, it is necessary to determine, first, whether that Framework Decision precludes the implementation of such a recognition procedure.</p>

            <p>To that end, it is appropriate, as is open to the Court in accordance with the Court's settled case-law (judgment of 21 December 2016, Ucar and Kilic, C‑508/15 and C‑509/15, EU:C:2016:986, paragraph 51 and case-law cited), to reformulate the second question referred as seeking in essence to ascertain whether Framework Decision 2008/675 must be interpreted as precluding the possibility that it should be a prerequisite of account being taken, in a Member State, of a previous conviction handed down by a court of another Member State, that a national procedure for prior recognition of that conviction by the courts with jurisdiction in the former Member State, such as that laid down in, in particular, Articles 463 to 466 of the Code of Criminal Procedure at issue in the main proceedings, be implemented, and, if it does not preclude that possibility, whether that Framework Decision precludes national legislation that provides that that procedure may be initiated solely by the competent national authorities, but not by the convicted person.</p>

            <p>In order to answer that question, reference must be made to the content of Articles 463 to 466 of the Code of Criminal Procedure as set out in paragraphs 11 to 13 of the present judgment, from which it is apparent that those articles establish a special procedure for prior recognition, by the Bulgarian courts with jurisdiction, of convictions not subject to appeal handed down by foreign courts, with the aim of ensuring that the decision whereby those convictions are recognised has the effect of a conviction handed down by a Bulgarian court. That procedure involves an examination of the foreign conviction concerned in order to determine whether the conditions laid down in Article 463 are satisfied.</p>

            <p>In that regard, the national court admittedly must, for the purposes of the application of Article 3(1) of Framework Decision 2008/675, referred to in paragraph 26 of the present judgment, be in a position to determine, inter alia, whether previous national convictions are to be taken into account under national law and, if so, what effects are to be attached to them under that law.</p>

            <p>Nonetheless, as stated in recital 2 of the Framework Decision, the aim of Framework Decision 2008/675 is to implement the principle of mutual recognition of judgments and judicial decisions in criminal matters, a principle enshrined in Article 82(1) TFEU, which replaced Article 31 EU, on the basis of which that Framework Decision was adopted. As the Advocate General stated in points 30, 31 and 64 of his Opinion, that principle precludes the possibility that it should be a prerequisite of account being taken, in the context of that Framework Decision, of a previous conviction handed down by a court of another Member State, that a national procedure for prior recognition, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, be implemented, and also the possibility of that previous conviction being, in that procedure, reviewed (see, by analogy, judgment of 9 June 2016, Balogh, C‑25/15, EU:C:2016:423, paragraph 54).</p>

            <p>Article 3(3) and recital 13 of Framework Decision 2008/675 expressly proscribe such a review, since previous convictions handed down in other Member States must be taken into account in the terms in which they were handed down.</p>

            <p>Therefore, contrary to what is argued by the Austrian government, while recital 13 also states that that Framework Decision respects the diversity of domestic solutions and procedures required for taking into account a previous conviction handed down in another Member State and does not prevent a Member State from issuing a decision, if necessary, in order to attach the equivalent legal effects to that conviction, the adoption of such a decision cannot, however, in any event, involve the implementation of a national procedure for prior recognition such as that at issue in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>Consequently, the answer to the second question is that Framework Decision 2008/675 must be interpreted as precluding the possibility that it should be a prerequisite of account being taken, in a Member State, of a previous conviction handed down by a court of another Member State that a national procedure for prior recognition of that conviction by the courts with jurisdiction in the former Member State, such as that laid down in Articles 463 to 466 of the Code of Criminal Procedure at issue in the main proceedings, be implemented.</p>

            <p>First, it must be observed that it is apparent from the documents available to the Court that, by means of a decision of 15 October 2014, the Landesgericht Klagenfurt (Regional Court of Klagenfurt) held that the probation period of three years laid down by its decision of 13 December 2010 had come to an end and, consequently, finally brought to an end the part of the sentence imposed on Mr Beshkov that was suspended, with the result that that sentence as a whole has to be regarded as having been executed in its entirety. For the purposes of examining the third question, that fact must be taken into consideration, as the referring court was informed in correspondence on a request for clarification sent to it by the Court pursuant to Article 101 of the Court's Rules of Procedure.</p>

            <p>In answering that question, it must indeed be borne in mind, as stated in paragraph 26 of the present judgment, that, pursuant to Article 3(1) of Framework Decision 2008/675, previous convictions handed down in another Member State must, as a general rule, be taken into account to the extent that national previous convictions taken into account under national law and legal effects must be attached to them that are equivalent to those of the latter convictions, in accordance with national law.</p>

As stated in paragraph 37 of the present judgment, that provision also excludes any review of those convictions, which must therefore be taken into account in the terms in which they were handed down.</p>
