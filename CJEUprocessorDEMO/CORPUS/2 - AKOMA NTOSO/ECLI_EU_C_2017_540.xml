According to the Commission, full communication of that information would permit the public, and in particular the undertakings concerned, to raise questions or make criticisms in respect of the information communicated by the Member States, which would be likely to interfere in the decision-making process.

In the circumstances, the priority interests were to ensure that decisions were taken without any external interference and to preserve the climate of trust between the Commission and the German authorities.

The second ground of appeal alleges misapplication of Article 4(5) of Regulation No 1049/2001.</p>

That criticism serves precisely the objectives pursued by those rules, in particular better decision-making in environmental matters on the basis of information put to public scrutiny. Saint-Gobain adds that neither Regulation No 1367/2006 nor Directive 2003/4 sets out grounds for refusal of access relating to safeguarding relations between the Commission and the Member States.</p>

            <p>The Commission replies by submitting at the outset that the first ground of appeal is inadmissible. First of all, as that ground of appeal must be construed as calling into question the lawfulness of Regulation No 1367/2006 in the light of the provisions of the Aarhus Convention, it modifies the subject matter of the dispute as it was before the General Court. Next, in so far as the first ground of appeal could be construed as criticising the General Court for having disregarded the requirement to interpret the exception provided for in the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001 in the light of the concept of the expression `proceedings of public authorities' set out in Article 4(4)(a) of the Aarhus Convention, it is based on an argument which was not put forward or debated before the General Court. Lastly, the first ground of appeal does not identify precisely which paragraphs of the reasons in the judgment under appeal are being challenged.</p>

          <content eId="para_12950__content">
            <p>In any event, in the Commission's submission, the first ground of appeal is unfounded. Firstly, the wording of both Article 4(4)(a) of the Aarhus Convention and Article 4(2)(a) of Directive 2003/4 refer not to `internal proceedings' but simply `proceedings' of public authorities. Moreover, given that, like the Union, all Member States are party to the Aarhus Convention, it may be presumed that the EU legislature did not intend that Directive 2003/4 should place substantively different obligations on Member States than those imposed on EU bodies by Regulations Nos 1049/2001 and 1367/2006.</p>

          <content eId="para_12951__content">
            <p>Secondly, an interpretation of the concept of `proceedings' to the effect that it covers only operations internal to a public authority is only one of the possible interpretations of that concept, according to the indications found in the Aarhus Convention Implementation Guide, which the Court of Justice may take into consideration in interpreting the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, just like the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) of Regulation 1049/2001, the criterion used in Article 4(4)(a) of the Aarhus Convention is not the content of the document, but rather the `adverse effect' of disclosure of that content. Consequently, even if a document does not divulge a public authority's internal proceedings but only the factors that served as a basis for the adoption of its decision, access to that document could be refused under the latter provision.</p>

            <p>Thus, given that the first part of the first ground of appeal alleges infringement of the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001, Saint-Gobain's argument is merely the expansion of an argument already put forward as part of a plea in law set out in its application at first instance and accordingly cannot be held to be inadmissible.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be borne in mind that Article 169(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice specifies that the pleas in law and legal arguments relied on must identify precisely those points in the grounds of the decision of the General Court which are contested. An appeal that fails to identify which points of the judgment under appeal are being contested and the alleged error of law by the General Court is inadmissible (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 September 2016, NIOC and Others v Council, C‑595/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:721, paragraphs 95 and 96).</p>

            <p>In the present case, by the first part of the first ground of appeal, Saint-Gobain refers specifically to paragraphs 80 to 82 and 87 of the judgment under appeal. Moreover, in so far as it criticises the General Court for having failed to take account of the Aarhus Convention in its interpretation of Article 6 of Regulation No 1367/2006, clearly it was impossible for it to identify the specific points of the judgment in which the General Court failed to do so. It follows that the appeal satisfies the requirements of Article 169(2) of the Rules of Procedure.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary observation, it should be noted that, in accordance with the first recital of Regulation No 1049/2001, that regulation reflects the intention expressed in the second paragraph of Article 1 of the EU Treaty -- inserted by the Treaty of Amsterdam -- of marking a new stage in the process of creating an ever closer union among the peoples of Europe, in which decisions are taken as openly as possible and as closely as possible to the citizen. As is stated in recital 2 in the preamble to Regulation No 1049/2001, the right of public access to documents of the institutions is related to the democratic nature of those institutions (judgment of 1 July 2008, Sweden and Turco v Council, C‑39/05 P and C‑52/05 P, EU:C:2008:374, paragraph 34).</p>

            <p>Next, in paragraphs 86 to 90 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected Saint-Gobain's argument to the effect that the information requested does not concern the Commission's verification of the information communicated by the Member States pursuant to Article 15(1) of Decision 2011/278, but rather the table communicated by the German authorities to the Commission and cannot, therefore, be held to concern the decision-making process itself.</p>

            <p>In order to reach that conclusion, the General Court considered that, in using the expression `which relates to a matter' the legislature did not intend to restrict the scope of the information covered by the exception laid down in the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001 solely to documents drawn up as part of the decision-making process in question and that the use of that expression also allows for the application of that provision to documents directly relating to the matters dealt with in that process.</p>

            <p>The General Court's interpretation of the first subparagraph of Article 4(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001, confusing as it does the concepts of decision-making process and administrative procedure, has the effect of expanding the scope of the exception to the right of access provided for by that provision to the point where it allows a European Union institution to refuse access to any document, including documents containing environmental information, held by that institution, in so far as that document directly relates to matters dealt with as part of an administrative procedure pending before that institution.</p>

            <p>However, as observed by the Advocate General in point 76 of his Opinion, Article 4(4)(a) of the Aarhus Convention provides that a request for environmental information may be refused where disclosure of that information would adversely affect the confidentiality of the proceedings of public authorities, where such confidentiality is provided for under national law, and not the entire administrative procedure at the end of which those authorities hold their proceedings.</p>

Thus, the mere reference to a risk of negative repercussions linked to access to internal documents and the possibility that interested parties may influence the procedure do not suffice to prove that disclosure of those documents would seriously undermine the decision-making process of the institution concerned.</p>

In those circumstances, it cannot therefore be held that such disclosure jeopardises compliance with time limits in administrative procedures conducted by the Commission.</p>

Those interferences would, in turn, be likely seriously to delay the decision-making process and to prejudice the dialogue between the Commission and the Member States. The Commission also considered relevant the fact that it had not yet adopted a decision on that information and that such a decision was expected within the time limits granted.
