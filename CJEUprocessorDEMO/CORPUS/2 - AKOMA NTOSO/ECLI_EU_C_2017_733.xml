            <p>The judgment of the Commissione tributaria provinciale di Milano (Provincial Tax Court, Milan) of 27 March 2013 was confirmed by the Commissione tributaria regionale della Lombardia (Regional Tax Court, Lombardy, Italy), which took the view that the Revenue Authority's position was `manifestly contrary' to Article 144 of the VAT Directive.

            <p>In those circumstances, the Corte suprema di cassazione (Supreme Court of Cassation) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling: `Can Article 144 and Article 86(1) of [the VAT Directive] [corresponding to Article 14(1) and (2) and Article 11. B(3) of Sixth Council Directive 77/388/EEC of 17 May 1977 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes -- Common system of value added tax: uniform basis of assessment ( OJ 1977 L 145, p. 1)], taken together, be interpreted to mean that the only condition in order for connected services consisting of the ``inbound '' transport service -- from airports to the place of destination within the territory of the Member State, with the ``free-at-destination '' clause -- not to be liable to VAT is that their value is included in the taxable amount, regardless of whether or not the goods in question were in fact subject to customs duties, at the time of their importation; and is it therefore incompatible with those [EU law] provisions if the domestic rules laid down in [point 2 of] Article 9(1) and Article 69(1) of [Decree No 633/72] read together in the versions in force at the time of the material facts, provide that in every case, and therefore also in the case of imports that are not liable to VAT -- as is the case here, since it concerns documents and goods of negligible value -- there has to be compliance with the additional requirement that those imports must in fact be liable to VAT (and customs duty must in fact be paid) at the time of the importation of such goods, even, if need be, when account is taken of the ancillary nature of the transport services in relation to the main services (namely the importation) and of the rationale of simplification underlying both the main and the ancillary operations?

            <p>In that regard, it should be recalled that, for VAT purposes, each transaction must normally be regarded as distinct and independent, as follows from the second subparagraph of Article 1(2) of the VAT Directive (see, to that effect, judgment of 17 January 2013, BGŻ Leasing, C‑224/11, EU:C:2013:15, paragraph 29).</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, it is also clear from the case-law of the Court that, in certain circumstances, several formally distinct services, which could be supplied separately and thus give rise, separately, to taxation or exemption, must be considered to constitute a single transaction when they are not independent. There is a single supply where two or more elements or acts supplied by the taxable person to the customer are so closely linked that they form, objectively, a single, indivisible economic supply, which it would be artificial to split (judgment of 16 July 2015, Mapfre asistencia and Mapfre warranty, C‑584/13, EU:C:2015:488, paragraph 50).</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be noted that Article 86(1)(b) of the VAT Directive ensures that the taxation of the ancillary service follows the taxation of the primary service. According to Article 144 of that directive, first, the exempted primary service corresponds to that of the importation of goods and, second, the ancillary services are the services listed in Article 86(1)(b) of that directive, which should, as such, follow the tax treatment of the primary service, provided that their value is included in the taxable amount.</p>

            <p>Lastly, with regard to the objective pursued by the exemption at issue in the main proceedings, the Italian Government argues that that exemption seeks to avoid situations of double taxation, explaining that, in the situation where the transport costs are exempted from VAT for customs purposes, they should be liable to VAT, even if the consideration is included in the taxable amount. FedEx and the Commission take the view, by contrast, that the purpose of the exemption is technical simplification and, therefore, the application of such an exemption is independent of whether the transport costs are subjected to VAT for customs purposes. Consequently, in their view, the transport costs relating to importations are exempt from VAT on the basis of Article 144 of the VAT Directive, in so far as their value is included in the taxable amount.</p>
