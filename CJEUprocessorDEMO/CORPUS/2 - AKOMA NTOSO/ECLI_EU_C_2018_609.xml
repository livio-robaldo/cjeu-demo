            <p>The HS Explanatory Note relating to heading 8703 is worded as follows: `This heading covers motor vehicles of various types (including amphibious motor vehicles) designed for the transport of persons; it does not, however, cover the motor vehicles of heading 87.02. The vehicles of this heading may have any type of motor (internal combustion piston engine, electric motor, gas turbine, etc.). The heading also covers lightweight three-wheeled vehicles such as:</p>

                <p>those fitted with motorcycle engines and wheels, etc., but which, by virtue of their mechanical structure, possess the characteristics of conventional motor cars. That is to say, they are provided with a motor car type steering system or both reverse gear and differential;</p>
              </item>
              <item>
                <num>--</num>
                <p>those mounted on a T-shaped chassis, whose two rear wheels are independently driven by separate battery-powered electric motors. These vehicles are normally operated by means of a single central control stick with which the driver can start, accelerate, brake, stop and reverse the vehicle, as well as steer it to the right or to the left by applying a differential torque to the drive wheels or by turning the front wheel. Three-wheeled vehicles of the above-described character are classified under heading 87.04 if they are designed for the transport of goods. The vehicles of this heading may be of the wheeled or track-laying type. The heading also includes: 1. Motor cars (e.g., limousines, taxis, sports cars and racing cars). 2. Specialised transport vehicles such as ambulances, prison vans and hearses. ... 4. Vehicles specially designed for travelling on snow (e.g., snowmobiles). 5. Golf cars and similar vehicles. 6. Four-wheeled motor vehicles with tube chassis, having a motor-car type steering system (e.g., a steering system based on the Ackerman principle). For the purposes of this heading, the expression `` station wagons '' means vehicles with a maximum seating capacity of nine persons (including the driver), the interior of which may be used, without structural alteration, for the transport of both persons and goods. The classification of certain motor vehicles in this heading is determined by certain features which indicate that the vehicles are principally designed for the transport of persons rather than for the transport of goods (heading 87.04). These design features are especially helpful in determining the classification of motor vehicles which generally have a gross vehicle weight rating of less than 5 tonnes and which have a single enclosed interior space comprising an area for the driver and passengers and another area that may be used for the transport of both persons and goods. Included in this category of motor vehicles are those commonly known as ``multipurpose '' vehicles (e.g., van-type vehicles, sports utility vehicles, certain pick-up type vehicles). The following features are indicative of the design characteristics generally applicable to the vehicles which fall in this heading:</p>

            <p>On 13 January 2017 the Agency lodged an appeal against that judgment before the Commissione tributaria regionale del Lazio (Regional Tax Court, Lazio, Italy). In particular, it maintained that the HS Explanatory Note relating to CN heading 8703 also includes `specialised transport vehicles such as ambulances, prison vans and hearses.'</p>

            <p>That court states, first, that the HS Explanatory Note relating to CN heading 8703 includes, inter alia, specialised transport vehicles such as ambulances, prison vans and hearses, and also multipurpose vehicles `which have a single enclosed interior space comprising an area for the driver and passengers and another area that may be used for the transport of both persons and goods.' It points out in that regard that, despite the specific reference to hearses among vehicles included under CN heading 8703, the structural and objective characteristics of those vehicles do not correspond to those indicated in the HS Explanatory Note. Thus, hearses do not have a single enclosed space comprising an area for the driver and passengers and another area that may be used for the transport of both persons and goods, since, on the contrary, a fixed and hermetic barrier is installed, which is necessary for hygienic and sanitary reasons, separating the driver's cab from the rear area.</p>

            <p>Second, the referring court states that the HS Explanatory Note relating to CN heading 8704 indicates, in particular, construction characteristics which vehicles under that heading generally have as being the presence of a permanent panel or barrier between the area for the driver and front passengers and the rear area as well as the lack of windows on the rear part of the lateral panel. Those characteristics would appear to be fully consistent with those of hearses.</p>

            <p>Consequently, the referring court takes the view that the specific reference to hearses in the HS Explanatory Note, under CN heading 8703, is incompatible with the objective conditions which motor vehicles must fulfil in order to come within that heading. Given that the HS Explanatory Note is not binding, the classification of hearses under CN heading 8704 cannot be ruled out.</p>

            <p>The referring court asks, in essence, whether hearses such as those at issue in the main proceedings must be classified as vehicles designed for the transport of persons, under CN heading 8703, as vehicles designed for the transport of goods under CN heading 8704, or as special-purpose vehicles, other than those principally designed for the transport of persons or goods, under CN heading 8705.</p>

            <p>In order to provide a helpful answer to the referring court, it must be stated at the outset that, as is apparent from paragraph 11 of the present judgment, first, the general rules for the interpretation of the CN provide that the classification of goods is to be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes, the titles of sections, chapters and sub-chapters being provided for ease of reference only.</p>

            <p>Second, according to the Court's settled case-law, in the interests of legal certainty and ease of verification, the decisive criterion for the classification of goods is in general to be sought in their objective characteristics and properties as defined in the wording of the relevant heading of the CN and of the notes to the sections or chapters (judgment of 12 June 2014, Lukoyl Neftohim Burgas, Câ€‘330/13, EU:C:2014:1757, paragraph 34 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Next, the intended use of a product may constitute an objective criterion for classification if it is inherent to the product, and that inherent character must be capable of being assessed on the basis of the product's objective characteristics and properties (judgment of 6 December 2007, Van Landeghem, Câ€‘486/06, EU:C:2007:762, paragraph 24 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Lastly, it should be recalled, according to the Court's case-law, that the Explanatory Note drawn up, as regards the CN, by the Commission and, as regards the HS, by the WCO, is an important aid to the interpretation of the scope of the various headings but does not have legally binding force. Moreover, although the WCO opinions classifying goods in the HS do not have legally binding force, they amount, as regards the classification of those goods in the CN, to indications which are an important aid to the interpretation of the scope of the various tariff headings of the CN (judgment of 6 December 2007, Van Landeghem, Câ€‘486/06, EU:C:2007:762, paragraph 25 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Pilato claims that hearses must be classified under CN heading 8704, since they have characteristics comparable to those referred to in the HS Explanatory Note for vehicles for the transport of goods, whereas the Italian Government and the Commission take the view that hearses must be classified under CN heading 8703.</p>

            <p>It is apparent from the wording of CN headings 8703, 8704 and 8705 that the first covers means of transport for persons in general, whereas the second relates to the means of transport for goods and the third concerns special-purpose means of transport, which, in principle, are not designed for transporting people or goods.</p>

            <p>Moreover, according to the wording of heading 8703, that is, ` ... motor vehicles principally designed for the transport of persons', the principal intended use of those vehicles is decisive for their classification. It follows from the use of the term `designed', as supported by the settled case-law of the Court referred to in paragraph 25 of this judgment, that the principal intended use of the vehicle is decisive, provided that it is inherent to the product. The intended use is determined by the general appearance of the vehicles at issue in the main proceedings and on the basis of the entirety of the characteristics of those vehicles which give them their essential character (judgment of 6 December 2007, Van Landeghem, Câ€‘486/06, EU:C:2007:762, paragraph 27 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the present case, having regard to the description of the vehicle at issue in the main proceedings, which is referred to in paragraph 14 of the present judgment, hearses are particularly built and equipped for the transport of coffins, which contain corpses. In that regard, as the Italian Government and the Commission point out, a human body, even lifeless, cannot be treated in the same way as goods which may be the subject, as such, of commercial transactions. Therefore, the principal use of hearses is for the transport of persons.</p>

It is only the seventh paragraph of that note which states that `[t]he classification of certain motor vehicles in this heading is determined by certain features which indicate that the vehicles are principally designed for the transport of persons rather than for the transport of goods', and that `[i]ncluded in this category of motor vehicles are those commonly known as ``multipurpose '' vehicles'.

            <p>It follows that the Explanatory Note refers, first, specifically to vehicles which fall within CN heading 8703, without further clarification. It describes, second, as is apparent from its wording, characteristics to identify the vehicles whose classification is ambiguous and to indicate that the principal intended use of those vehicles is the transport of persons.

            <p>In those circumstances, the fact that that Explanatory Note provides no indication concerning the design characteristics which the specialised transport vehicles listed therein must have means that hearses are classified under CN heading 8703, without it being necessary that they have other specific characteristics.</p>

            <p>That finding cannot be called into question by Pilato's arguments, according to which hearses should be classified under CN heading 8704 on the ground that they have characteristics which are broadly comparable to those set out in the HS Explanatory Note for motor vehicles for the transport of goods under that tariff heading.</p>
