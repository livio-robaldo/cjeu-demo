            <p>First of all, the General Court held, in paragraph 38 of the judgment under appeal, that it had no jurisdiction, under Article 275 TFEU, to rule on the third head of claim, on the ground that the plea of illegality made under Article 277 TFEU in the context of that third head of claim had not been raised in support of an action for annulment brought against `a decision providing for restrictive measures against natural or legal persons', within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 275 TFEU, the measures laid down in Article 1, point 6, of Decision 2012/635 being measures of a general nature whose scope is determined by reference to objective criteria.</p>

            <p>Next, under the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU, the General Court, in paragraphs 59 to 61 of the judgment under appeal, dismissed the action as inadmissible in so far as it concerned, first, Article 30a of Regulation No 267/2012, as introduced by Article 1, point 15, of the regulation at issue, on the ground that Bank Mellat, as a financial institution established in Iran, was not referred to in that provision and, second, the first subparagraph of Article 30b(3) of Regulation No 267/2012, on the ground that that provision did not concern Bank Mellat directly and, moreover, entailed implementing measures.</p>

            <p>In that context, the General Court, in paragraphs 68 to 78 of the judgment under appeal, also rejected the plea of inadmissibility raised by the Council of the European Union alleging that, at the date of making the application, Bank Mellat had no interest in contesting the legality of the regime provided for in Article 1, point 15, of the regulation at issue, since it was already subject to the individual fund-freezing measures adopted under Regulation No 267/2012, essentially on the ground that, when the annulment of those individual measures took effect following the delivery of the judgment of 18 February 2016, Council v Bank Mellat ( C‑176/13 P, EU:C:2016:96), Bank Mellat was automatically subject to the regime at issue, with all the restrictions flowing therefrom, without any further legal act being involved, and therefore retained an interest in contesting it.</p>

            <p>The Council submits primarily that Bank Mellat has not established any interest in bringing the proceedings, since the regime at issue was repealed with effect from 16 January 2016.</p>

            <p>The annulment of that regime would not restore Bank Mellat to its original position, since those measures were of general application and concerned all Iranian financial institutions equally. That annulment also would not lead the Council to make suitable amendments in the future, since those measures have already been lifted.</p>

            <p>In addition, since the General Court confirmed, in the judgment under appeal, the legality of the regime at issue, any annulment of it by the Court of Justice could not in any case serve as the basis for an action for liability of the European Union, since the condition relating to the existence of a sufficiently serious breach of a rule of law would not be met.</p>

            <p>In that respect, it should be noted that, before the General Court, the Council contended that, on the date of bringing the action, Bank Mellat had no interest in contesting the legality of Article 1, point 15, of the regulation at issue, since it was already subject to individual fund and asset freezing measures.</p>

            <p>In paragraphs 74 to 77 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected that plea of inadmissibility on the basis of the following reasoning: `74 In the present case, at the time when the action was brought, [Bank Mellat] was subject to individual restrictive measures ... linked to its alleged involvement in nuclear proliferation. Although those restrictive measures were annulled by the [judgment of 29 January 2013, Bank Mellat v Council ( T‑496/10, EU:T:2013:39)], the taking effect of that annulment was suspended until the determination of the appeal, in accordance with Article 60 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union.</p>

            <p>However, it must be noted that the regime at issue as such applies to all financial institutions established in Iran, and consequently also to [Bank Mellat]. This means, inter alia, that when, subsequently, the annulment of the individual restrictive measures relating to [Bank Mellat] took effect following the dismissal of the Council's appeal against the judgment [of 29 January 2013, Bank Mellat v Council ( T‑496/10, EU:T:2013:39)], [Bank Mellat] was automatically subject to that regime, with all the restrictions flowing therefrom, without any further legal act being involved.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, a finding in the present case that [Bank Mellat] has no interest in bringing proceedings against Article 1(15) of the regulation [at issue] would have the effect of infringing [Bank Mellat's] right to effective judicial protection, in so far as, after the definitive disappearance of the individual restrictive measures relating to [Bank Mellat], it would be subject to the effects of the regime at issue but would not be entitled to seek annulment of Article 1(15) of the regulation [at issue], because the period for bringing an action would have expired.'</p>

That purpose must, like the interest in bringing proceedings, continue until the final decision, failing which there will be no need to adjudicate; that presupposes that the action must be capable, if successful, of procuring an advantage for the party bringing it (judgments of 28 May 2013, Abdulrahim v Council and Commission, C‑239/12 P, EU:C:2013:331, paragraph 61, and of 9 November 2017, HX v Council, C‑423/16 P, EU:C:2017:848, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>That conclusion cannot be called into question by Bank Mellat's argument that its continuing interest in bringing proceedings can be based on the principle laid down by the Court in its judgment of 7 June 2007, Wunenburger v Commission ( C‑362/05 P, EU:C:2007:322), since it is necessary to prevent the Council from implementing restrictive measures again, such as those imposed by the regime at issue and which Bank Mellat regards as unlawful, should the Islamic Republic of Iran fail to comply with certain conditions of the JCPOA.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it follows from the Court's case-law that, in certain circumstances, an applicant may retain an interest in seeking the annulment of an act repealed in the course of proceedings, in order to induce the author of the contested act to make suitable amendments in the future, and thereby avoid the risk that the unlawfulness alleged in respect of that act will be repeated (judgment of 28 May 2013, Abdulrahim v Council and Commission, C‑239/12 P, EU:C:2013:331, paragraph 63).</p>

            <p>However, the principle thus enshrined in the case-law must, as the Advocate General has also stated in point 44 of his Opinion, be limited to situations in which the applicant demonstrates precisely and specifically the existence of a risk of repetition of the alleged unlawfulness.</p>

            <p>Although it cannot definitively be excluded that, in the future, restrictive measures may be adopted again against the Islamic Republic of Iran, as Bank Mellat maintained, in such a case it would be a new situation giving rise, where appropriate, to restrictive measures taking the form either of measures comparable to those imposed by the regime at issue, or of measures of a different nature. However, even assuming the unlawfulness of the regime at issue, which has not been determined by the Court, the mere assumption of the repetition of such alleged unlawfulness by the adoption, in the future, of restrictive measures comparable to that regime is not sufficient to demonstrate, in view, inter alia, of the Council's broad discretion in defining the subject of the restrictive measures (judgment of 28 March 2017, Rosneft, C‑72/15, EU:C:2017:236, paragraph 88), in a sufficiently precise and specific manner, the risk of such a repetition to enable Bank Mellat to retain an interest in bringing proceedings in the present case.</p>

            <p>It follows that, having regard to the principles enshrined in the case-law recalled in paragraph 50 of this judgment, there was no longer any need for the General Court to adjudicate on the action for annulment brought by Bank Mellat against the regime at issue, since, in the course of proceedings and before the delivery of the judgment under appeal, Bank Mellat had lost any interest in bringing proceedings against the regime at issue. As a result of the regime's deletion with effect from 16 January 2016 and in the light of the findings made in paragraphs 51 to 67 of this judgment, that action was not capable, if successful, of procuring an advantage for the appellant.</p>
