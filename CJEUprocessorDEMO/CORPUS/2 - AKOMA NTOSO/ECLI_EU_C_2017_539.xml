            <p>Ms Kleinsteuber, born on 3 April 1965, was employed by Mars and its predecessor in law between 1 October 1990 and 31 May 2014, in various positions. She worked both full-time and part-time, with rates of activity of between 50% and 75% of the activity of a full-time employee. Mrs Kleinsteuber enjoys, in relation to Mars and after having reached the age of 55, the right to an occupational pension.</p>

            <p>According to the pension plan, in the case of a worker who is not employed full-time, first of all, the relevant annual salary of the worker who is entitled to a pension is calculated. Then, that salary is reduced by the average rate of activity during the whole of the period of employment. Finally, the different rates relating to the salary's components are applied to the resulting amount. The amount of the occupational pension is thus calculated using a so-called `split pension' formula.</p>

            <p>A distinction is thus drawn between the income earned falling below the ceiling for calculating contributions to the statutory pension scheme and income exceeding that ceiling. The ceiling for calculating contributions is, in German social security law, the amount up to which the salary of a person benefiting from statutory cover is used for social insurance. The salary components above the contributions calculation ceiling were valued, during the calculation of Ms Kleinsteuber's occupational pension, at 2% whereas the salary components under that limit were valued at 0.6%.</p>

            <p>As is apparent from the order for reference, in case of early retirement of an employee, a pro rata temporis calculation is carried out pursuant to the first sentence of Paragraph 2(1) of the Law on Pensions. First of all, the `notional maximum entitlement' is calculated, namely the right to a pension which a worker would enjoy if he were not to leave his employment early, but remained employed until reaching the negotiated retirement age. Then, the `non-forfeitability quotient' is calculated by determining the ratio between the actual length of service and the length of service remaining until the employee would have reached retirement age had he not retired early. The notional maximum entitlement is then multiplied by the non-forfeitability quotient in order to determine the amount of the occupational pension or his future entitlement to that pension.</p>

Is the relevant EU law, in particular the principle of non-discrimination on grounds of age, enshrined in Article 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and given specific expression by Council Directive 2000/78/EC, in particular Articles 1, 2 and 6 thereof, to be interpreted as precluding national statutory provisions or practices which provide for an occupational old-age pension in the amount corresponding to the ratio of the employee's actual length of service to the time from the beginning of his employment up to his reaching the normal retirement age under the statutory pension scheme and in so doing apply a maximum limit of reckonable years of service, with the result that employees having completed their period of service in an undertaking at a younger age receive a smaller occupational pension than their colleagues who completed their period of service at an older age, even though both sets of employees completed an equal length of service in the undertaking?'</p>

            <p>Ms Kleinsteuber nevertheless claims that that calculation method results in too low a proportion of the annual pensionable income being allocated to the higher 2% rate. Whereas, in accordance with its pension scheme, Mars calculated, on the basis of full-time employment, the pensionable annual salary applicable to the applicant before reducing it on the basis of her part-time rate of activity, broke down the amount thus obtained into a band below the ceiling for the calculation of contributions and a band above it and applied to them the various rates, Ms Kleinsteuber considers that the calculation for persons employed part-time should be carried out by calculating the notional income of a full-time employee and applying the split formula to him. Only then can a reduction be carried out on the basis of the part-time rate of activity.</p>

Similarly, if part-time remuneration is below that ceiling, the method suggested by the applicant in the main proceedings would result in the 2% rate being applied, since the split formula would be applied directly to the annual remuneration of a corresponding full-time employee, before even reducing it on the basis of the part-time activity of the employee concerned.

            <p>In that regard, Mars has submitted that the objective of that legislation and, specifically, the occupational pension scheme at issue is to find a rule applicable to the calculation of the amount of the acquired rights in the event of early withdrawal from the employment relationship, which complies with the broad concept of the occupational pension system governing ordinary pension plans, and to thus contribute to the generalisation of occupational pensions, the latter being awarded on a voluntary basis by the employer.</p>

            <p>It must be considered that such objectives, which aim to establish a balance between the interests at issue, in the context of concerns falling within employment policy and social protection, in order to guarantee the provision of an occupational pension, may be considered public interest objectives.</p>

            <p>As regards the appropriateness of the legislation at issue in the main proceedings, it must be noted that the adoption of a method of calculating a right legally acquired in the event of early withdrawal from the employment relationship based on the pro rata temporis duration of the actual years of service compared to the possible years of service up to the normal age of retirement, and on the capping of reckonable years of service, does not seem unreasonable in the light of the objective of the occupational pension scheme at issue in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>The same is true as regards the necessity of the legislation at issue in the main proceedings. Indeed, it must be noted that an incentive to remain in the undertaking until the statutory age of retirement cannot be created without giving the employee making that choice an advantage compared to the employee who leaves the undertaking early. Moreover, there is nothing in the documents before the Court to seriously call into question the necessity of such legislation, nor any other calculation rule, such as that advocated by Ms Kleinsteuber, which would make it possible to usefully meet the objectives referred to, in particular that of the generalisation of occupational pensions.</p>

            <p>In the light of all of those considerations, the answer to the second question is that Articles 1 and 2 as well as Article 6(1) of Directive 2000/78 must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which provides for an occupational pension in the amount corresponding to the ratio between</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules: 1) Clause 4.1 and 4.2 of the Framework Agreement on part-time work concluded on 6 June 1997, annexed to Council Directive 97/81/EC of 15 December 1997 concerning the Framework Agreement on part-time work concluded by UNICE, CEEP and the ETUC, as amended by Directive 2006/54/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 July 2006 on the implementation of the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women in matters of employment and occupation, must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which, in calculating the amount of an occupational pension, distinguishes between employment income falling below the ceiling for the calculation of contributions to the statutory pension scheme and employment income above that ceiling, and which does not treat income from part-time employment by calculating first the income payable in respect of corresponding full-time employment, then determining the proportion above and below the contribution assessment ceiling and finally applying that proportion to the reduced income from part-time employment. 2) Clause 4.1 and 4.2 of the Framework Agreement and Article 4 of Directive 2006/54 must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which, in calculating the amount of the occupational pension of an employee who has accumulated full-time and part-time employment periods, determines a uniform rate of activity for the total duration of the employment relationship, in so far as that calculation method of the pension does not violate thepro rata temporisrule. It is for the national court to satisfy itself that this is the case. 3) Articles 1 and 2 and Article 6(1) of Council Directive 2000/78/EC of 27 November 2000 establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which provides for an occupational pension in the amount corresponding to the ratio between (i) the employee's length of service and (ii) the length of the period between taking up employment in the undertaking and the normal retirement age under the statutory pension scheme, and in so doing applies a maximum limit of reckonable years of service.</p>
