The dossier shall contain the information and documents referred to in Articles 8, 10, 10a, 10b, 10c and 11. The documents submitted shall include a list of Member States concerned by the application. The applicant shall request one Member State to act as ``reference Member State '' and to prepare an assessment report on the medicinal product in accordance with paragraphs 2 or 3. 2.   Where the medicinal product has already received a marketing authorisation at the time of application, the concerned Member States shall recognise the marketing authorisation granted by the reference Member State. To this end, the marketing authorisation holder shall request the reference Member State either to prepare an assessment report on the medicinal product or, if necessary, to update any existing assessment report. The reference Member State shall prepare or update the assessment report within 90 days of receipt of a valid application. The assessment report together with the approved summary of product characteristics, labelling and package leaflet shall be sent to the concerned Member States and to the applicant. 3.   In cases where the medicinal product has not received a marketing authorisation at the time of application, the applicant shall request the reference Member State to prepare a draft assessment report, a draft summary of product characteristics and a draft of the labelling and package leaflet. The reference Member State shall prepare these draft documents within 120 days of receipt of a valid application and shall send them to the concerned Member States and to the applicant. 4.   Within 90 days of receipt of the documents referred to in paragraphs 2 and 3, the Member States concerned shall approve the assessment report, the summary of product characteristics, the labelling and the package leaflet and inform the reference Member State accordingly. The reference Member State shall record the agreement of all parties, close the procedure and inform the applicant accordingly. 5.   Each Member State in which an application has been submitted in accordance with paragraph 1 shall adopt a decision in conformity with the approved assessment report, the summary of product characteristics and the labelling and package leaflet as approved, within 30 days after acknowledgement of the agreement.'</p>

            <p>It should be observed at the outset that Article 3(b) of the SPC Regulation requires, in order for an SPC to be granted for a product as a medicinal product, a valid marketing authorisation to have been obtained in accordance with Directive 2001/83.</p>

            <p>Moreover, with regard to the context of that provision, it is clear that the legislature established a connection between the SPC Regulation and Directive 2001/83 by linking the grant of an SPC to the grant of a marketing authorisation under the directive.</p>

Article 28(4) of the directive provides that the reference Member State is to record the agreement of all parties, close the procedure and inform the applicant accordingly. Under Article 28(5) of the directive, each Member State is to adopt a decision authorising the marketing of the product concerned, in conformity with the approved assessment report and the related documents, within 30 days of acknowledgement of the agreement of all the parties.</p>
