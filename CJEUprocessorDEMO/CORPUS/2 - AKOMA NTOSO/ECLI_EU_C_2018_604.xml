            <p>Furthermore, that court considers that the fact that the company which pays the income subject to withholding tax is required to pay interest on the tax which the company established in another Member State is not required to pay contradicts the ancillary nature of the interest debt. According to that court, in the Bulgarian legal system, there is no other provision which, in the event of failure to comply with the legal requirement to prove that a right exists, requires another person to be charged interest in respect of a tax which does not have to be paid.</p>

            <p>Thus, first, Article 5(4) TEU relates to action of the EU institutions. In accordance with the first subparagraph of that provision, under the principle of proportionality, the content and form of EU action is not to exceed what is necessary to achieve the objectives of the Treaties. The second paragraph of that provision concerns the EU institutions and the requirement for them to comply with the principle of proportionality when they act in the exercise of a competence. In this case, the national provision at issue in the main proceedings arises from the Tax Code of Procedure adopted by the Bulgarian legislature and concerns the procedural treatment of taxpayers in Bulgaria.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it is important to note that Article 56 TFEU precludes the application of any national rules which have the effect of making the provision of services between Member States more difficult than the provision of services purely within a Member State. In accordance with the Court's case-law, Article 56 TFEU requires the abolition of any restriction on the freedom to provide services imposed on the ground that the person providing a service is established in a Member State other than that in which the service is provided (see, in particular, judgment of 18 October 2012, X, C‑498/10, EU:C:2012:635, paragraphs 20 and 21 and the case-law cited).</p>

Second, according to Article 175(2), point 3 of the Tax Code of Procedure, a resident company which pays out income to a non-resident person must, in respect of any taxation of a non-resident person who in principle is subject to withholding tax, pay default interest in the event of non-payment from the point at which the time limit laid down by Bulgarian law for the payment of the tax expires until the date on which the non-resident person furnishes evidence that the requirements have been fulfilled for the application of a double taxation convention entered into between the Republic of Bulgaria and the Member State in which that person is established, including in cases in which, pursuant to the convention, that person is not liable for any tax in Bulgaria or the amount thereof is lower than that normally payable under Bulgarian tax law.</p>

            <p>In that context, the Bulgarian Government and the respondent administration in the main proceedings draw attention to the aims and functions of the legislation at issue in the main proceedings. Under Article 202(2) of the Law on corporation tax, a resident company which pays out income subject to withholding tax under Article 195 of that law is required to pay the tax due within a period of three months from the beginning of the month following the month in which the income was paid, when the recipient of that income is a person established in a Member State with which the Republic of Bulgaria has entered into a double taxation convention. They state that, once that period has expired, the company which paid the income and which does not deduct and does not pay the withholding tax is in default of payment of the tax. They add that, according to Article 203 of that law, that company is also jointly and severally liable for payment of the tax deducted at source. Until it is established that the double taxation convention is applicable, the tax is deemed to be due, in accordance with Bulgarian legislation.</p>

            <p>According to the respondent administration in the main proceedings, the failure to pay the tax due within the time limit is penalised by the resident company's having to pay interest in accordance with Article 175(2), point 3 of the Tax Code of Procedure. It states that the interest is due irrespective of the fact that, under the relevant double taxation convention, the income is not taxable in Bulgaria. The payment of that interest penalises the failure to establish in due time that the double taxation convention, which excludes the application of Bulgarian law, is applicable.</p>

            <p>According to the Bulgarian Government, a provision such as Article 175(2), point 3 of the Tax Code of Procedure makes it possible to achieve the objective pursued by national law, which is to collect taxpayers' taxes on time, without undermining the objectives and principles laid down by EU law. That provision therefore aims to enable the tax authorities to plan for and forecast corporation tax receipts and to ensure the effective collection of tax. Furthermore, Article 175(2), point 3 of the Tax Code of Procedure constitutes an incentive for taxable persons to prove within the period prescribed that the requirements for the application of the relevant double taxation convention have been fulfilled when, pursuant to that convention, no tax is payable or the amount thereof is lower than that normally payable under Bulgarian tax law.</p>

            <p>As regards the reasons put forward in order to justify the restriction on the freedom to provide services, and as has been noted at paragraph 53 of this judgment, the Court has already held that the need to ensure the effective collection of tax and the need to ensure the effectiveness of fiscal supervision may constitute overriding reasons in the public interest capable of justifying a restriction on the freedom to provide services. The Court has also held that the imposition of penalties, including criminal penalties, may be considered to be necessary in order to ensure compliance with national rules, subject, however, to the condition that the nature and amount of the penalty imposed is in each individual case proportionate to the gravity of the infringement which it is designed to penalise (see, to that effect, judgment of 26 May 2016, NN (L) International, C‑48/15, EU:C:2016:356, paragraph 59 and the case-law cited.)</p>

            <p>In this case, the need to ensure the collection of withholding tax on cross-border payments and to ensure the effectiveness of fiscal supervision in cross-border situations such as those at issue in the main proceedings appears to justify penalties being imposed on companies which do not pay the taxes within the prescribed time limit and which do not provide on time the documents proving that they can claim an exemption from the obligation to pay those taxes.</p>

            <p>However, national legislation providing for a penalty in the form of irrecoverable interest, calculated on the basis of the sum of tax payable at source according to national legislation and which has accrued for the period from the date on which the tax becomes payable to the date on which the documents proving that the double taxation convention is applicable are submitted to the tax authorities, is not appropriate to ensure the attainment of the objectives referred to in the previous paragraph in the event that it is established that the tax is not payable under the relevant convention. In a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, there is no connection between the amount of interest payable, on the one hand, and the amount of tax payable, of which there is none, or the seriousness of the delay in providing those documents to the tax authorities, on the other.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, such a penalty goes beyond what is necessary to attain those objectives, given that the amount of interest accrued may prove to be excessive compared to the amount of tax payable and given that no possibility for that interest to be reimbursed is provided for.</p>

            <p>As the Commission pointed out, the amount of interest for late payment of the tax is the same irrespective of whether the tax is ultimately not payable or the tax withheld at source is payable but has not been paid on time. In the latter situation, which differs from that in the main proceedings, the Bulgarian tax authorities suffer a loss of tax receipts in the period during which the tax is not paid. However, in the main proceedings, it is only the delay in providing the evidence which is penalised.</p>

            <p>Moreover, it should be stated that there are other possibilities that would enable the same objectives to be attained. That would be the case if reimbursement to the resident company of the interest paid for late payment was provided for in the event that the tax debt was recalculated and that it was established that no tax is payable in Bulgaria in respect of income paid to the non-resident company.</p>

            <p>In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the question referred is that Article 56 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding legislation of a Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, whereby the payment of income by a resident company to a company established in another Member State is, in principle, subject to withholding tax, except where otherwise provided in the double taxation convention entered into between those two Member States, if that legislation requires the resident company, which neither deducts nor pays that sum to the tax authorities of the first Member State, to pay irrecoverable default interest for the period from the expiry of the time limit for payment of the income tax up to the date on which the non-resident company proves that the requirements for the application of the double taxation convention have been fulfilled, even though, in accordance with that convention, the non-resident company is not liable to pay any tax in the first Member State or the amount thereof is lower than that normally payable under the tax law of that Member State.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Seventh Chamber) hereby rules: Article 56 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding legislation of a Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, whereby the payment of income by a resident company to a company established in another Member State is, in principle, subject to withholding tax, except where otherwise provided in the double taxation convention entered into between those two Member States, if that legislation requires the resident company, which neither deducts nor pays that sum to the tax authorities of the first Member State, to pay irrecoverable default interest for the period from the expiry of the time limit for payment of the income tax up to the date on which the non-resident company proves that the requirements for the application of the double taxation convention have been fulfilled, even though, in accordance with that convention, the non-resident company is not liable to pay any tax in the first Member State or the amount thereof is lower than that normally payable under the tax law of that Member State.</p>
