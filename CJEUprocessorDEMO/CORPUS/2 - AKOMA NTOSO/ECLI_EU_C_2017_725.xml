That expression is used for persons acting as `fronts' in company director roles. Each natural person is, in principle, together with his national identity number and a tax identification number, associated with a legal person or legal persons -- of which there are 3369, according to Mr Puškár's indications -- within which he is deemed to be performing duties during a determined period.</p>

Second, those reasons relate to the fact that such an obligation contributes to the efficiency of the judicial procedure where that authority does not share the applicant's opinion and where the latter then lodges a legal action, because the judge can then rely on the existing administrative record.</p>

            <p>It is also for the referring court to determine whether the establishment of the contested list is necessary for the performance of the tasks carried out in the public interest at issue in the case in the main proceedings, taking account, in particular, of the precise purpose of the establishment of the contested list, the legal effects to which the persons appearing on it and the public nature of that list are subject and whether or not that list is of a public nature.</p>

            <p>It is important, in that regard, to ensure that the principle of proportionality is respected. The protection of the fundamental right to respect for private life at the European Union level requires that derogations from the protection of personal data and its limitations be carried out within the limits of what is strictly necessary (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 December 2016, Tele2 Sverige and Watson and Others, C‑203/15 and C‑698/15, EU:C:2016:970, paragraph 96 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It is thus for the national court to ascertain whether the establishment of the contested list and the inclusion of the names of the data subjects in such a register are suitable for achieving the objectives pursued by them and whether there is no other less restrictive means in order to achieve those objectives.</p>

            <p>The fact that a person is placed on the contested list is likely to infringe some of his rights. Indeed, inclusion in that list could harm his reputation and affect his relations with the tax authorities. Likewise, such inclusion could affect the presumption of innocence of that person, set out in Article 48(1) of the Charter, as well as the freedom of enterprise enshrined in Article 16 of the Charter of legal persons associated with the natural persons included in the contested list. It appears that an infringement of this kind can be proportionate only if there are sufficient grounds to suspect the person concerned of purportedly acting as a company director of the legal persons associated with him and accordingly undermines the public interest in the collection of taxes and combating tax fraud.</p>

            <p>In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the second question is that Article 7(e) Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as not precluding the processing of personal data by the authorities of a Member State for the purpose of collecting tax and combating tax fraud such as that effected by drawing up the contested list in the main proceedings, without the consent of the data subjects, provided that, first, those authorities were invested by the national legislation with tasks carried out in the public interest within the meaning of that article, that the drawing-up of that list and the inclusion on it of the names of the data subjects in fact be appropriate and necessary for the purpose of attaining the objectives pursued and that there be sufficient indications to assume that the data subjects are rightly included in that list and, second, that all of the conditions for the lawfulness of that processing of personal data imposed by Directive 95/46 be satisfied.</p>

            <p>118 By its fourth question, the national court asks, in essence, whether Article 47 of the Charter must be interpreted as precluding a national court, having found that, in a case before it, there are differences between the case-law of the European Court of Human Rights and that of the Court of Justice, following the latter.</p>

            <p>It should be borne in mind that the requirements concerning the content of a request for a preliminary ruling are expressly set out in Article 94 of the Court's Rules of Procedure, of which the national court should, in the context of the cooperation instituted by Article 267 TFEU, be aware and which it is bound to observe scrupulously. Thus, the referring court must set out the precise reasons that led it to raise the question of the interpretation of certain provisions of EU law and to consider it necessary to refer questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling. The Court has previously held that it is essential that the national court should give at the very least some explanation of the reasons for the choice of the EU law provisions which it seeks to have interpreted and of the link it establishes between those provisions and the national legislation applicable to the proceedings pending before it (judgment of 9 March 2017, Milkova, C‑406/15, EU:C:2017:198, paragraphs 72 and 73 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must be interpreted as meaning that it does not preclude national legislation, which makes the exercise of a judicial remedy by a person stating that his right to protection of personal data guaranteed by Directive 95/46/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 24 October 1995 on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data, has been infringed, subject to the prior exhaustion of the remedies available to him before the national administrative authorities, provided that the practical arrangements for the exercise of such remedies do not disproportionately affect the right to an effective remedy before a court referred to in that article. It is important, in particular, that the prior exhaustion of the available remedies before the national administrative authorities does not lead to a substantial delay in bringing a legal action, that it involves the suspension of the limitation period of the rights concerned and that it does not involve excessive costs. 2. Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union must be interpreted as precluding that a national court rejects, as evidence of an infringement of the protection of personal data conferred by Directive 95/46, a list, such as the contested list, submitted by the data subject and containing personal data relating to him, if that person had obtained that list without the consent, legally required, of the person responsible for processing that data, unless such rejection is laid down by national legislation and respects both the essential content of the right to an effective remedy and the principle of proportionality. 3. Article 7(e) Directive 95/46 must be interpreted as not precluding the processing of personal data by the authorities of a Member State for the purpose of collecting tax and combating tax fraud such as that effected by drawing up of a list of persons such as that at issue in the main proceedings, without the consent of the data subjects, provided that, first, those authorities were invested by the national legislation with tasks carried out in the public interest within the meaning of that article, that the drawing-up of that list and the inclusion on it of the names of the data subjects in fact be adequate and necessary for the attainment of the objectives pursued and that there be sufficient indications to assume that the data subjects are rightly included in that list and, second, that all of the conditions for the lawfulness of that processing of personal data imposed by Directive 95/46 be satisfied.</p>
