            <p>Hitachi and Polynt claim that paragraph 71 of the judgment under appeal states that the ECHA is not required to take a risk assessment into consideration whereas, in paragraph 73 of that judgment, the contrary is stated.

            <p>In paragraph 81 of that judgment, the General Court rejected the line of argument of Hitachi and Polynt relating to the need to take into consideration, amongst other things, existing risk management measures, on the ground that the intrinsic properties are sufficient to justify the identification of a substance as being of very high concern. Hitachi and Polynt dispute that interpretation of Article 57(f) of the REACH Regulation. Likewise, they claim that the General Court focused exclusively on a hazard-based assessment in rejecting, in paragraph 94 of the judgment under appeal, their line of argument relating to the read-across from HHPA data.</p>

            <p>Hitachi and Polynt claim that, contrary to what the General Court held in paragraphs 61 and 68 of the judgment under appeal, it is not apparent from Article 60(2) of the REACH Regulation that the fact that the negative effects associated with the use of a substance can be controlled adequately does not preclude its identification as a substance of very high concern. The General Court's interpretation is contrary to the `Guidance for the preparation of an Annex XV dossier on the identification of substances of very high concern', in the version applicable at the time of the decision at issue and mentioned in paragraph 49 of the judgment under appeal.</p>

            <p>The ECHA and the Commission contend that the reasoning in the judgment under appeal is not contradictory. The General Court correctly applied the judgment of 21 July 2011, Etimine ( C‑15/10, EU:C:2011:504), in holding, in paragraph 71 of the judgment under appeal, that Article 57(f) of the REACH Regulation does not require a risk assessment to be carried out. According to that agency, only an assessment of the hazards arising from the intrinsic properties of a substance is necessary. The ECHA and the Commission add that, since it was not possible to establish a Derived No-Effect Level for MHHPA, it was not possible to carry out a normal risk assessment for that substance.</p>

            <p>In determining whether, as Hitachi and Polynt claim, the General Court erred in law by holding, in paragraphs 61, 68, 71 and 81 of the judgment under appeal, that Article 57(f) of the REACH Regulation requires an analysis of the intrinsic properties of the substances concerned, to the exclusion of any consideration of data relating to human exposure reflecting the risk management measures in force, it must be recalled that, under Article 1(1) of the REACH Regulation, the purpose of that regulation is to ensure a high level of protection of human health and the environment, including the promotion of alternative methods for assessment of hazards of substances, as well as the free circulation of substances on the internal market while enhancing competitiveness and innovation. To that end, that regulation introduces an integrated system for monitoring chemical substances, including registration, evaluation and authorisation, together with possible restrictions on their use.</p>

            <p>As made clear, inter alia, in recitals 69 and 70 of the REACH Regulation, that regulation makes substances `of very high concern' subject to careful attention. Those substances are thus subject to the authorisation regime laid down in Title VII of that regulation. Article 55 of that regulation states that the aim of the authorisation regime is `to ensure the good functioning of the internal market while assuring that the risks from substances of very high concern are properly controlled and that these substances are progressively replaced by suitable alternative substances or technologies where these are economically and technically viable'.</p>

            <p>Article 57(a) to (c) of that regulation covers, first of all, substances meeting the criteria for classification in the hazard class carcinogenicity, mutagenicity or reproductive toxicity ( `CMR') category 1A or 1B, in accordance with sections 3.5 to 3.7 of Annex I to Regulation No 1272/2008. Next, Article 57(d) and (e) covers substances which are persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic ( `PBT') and those which are very persistent and very bioaccumulative ( `vPvB'), in accordance with the criteria set out in Annex XIII to the REACH Regulation. Those criteria are based on the assessment of the hazards presented by those substances. Lastly, Article 57(f) of that regulation covers all other substances which do not fulfil any of the foregoing criteria but `for which there is scientific evidence of probable serious effects to human health or the environment which give rise to an equivalent level of concern to those of other substances listed in points (a) to (e), and which are identified on a case-by-case basis in accordance with the procedure set out in Article 59'.</p>

            <p>In this connection, the classification of a substance under Annex I to Regulation No 1272/2008 constitutes a relevant, but not decisive, element. Where a substance falls within one of the hazard classes in respect of human health or the environment provided for in that regulation, that circumstance may be sufficient to show the probability of `serious effects to human health or the environment'. As the Advocate General has stated in points 61 and 63 of his Opinion, inclusion in a hazard class is nevertheless neither a necessary condition, nor a sufficient condition in this regard.</p>

            <p>Indeed, it follows from the structure of Article 57 of the REACH Regulation that, first, the EU legislature considered that not all substances of very high concern necessarily fall within the hazard classes set out in Annex I to Regulation No 1272/2008. Thus, the scope of Article 57(f) expressly encompasses endocrine disruptors, even though that type of effect does not fall within any hazard class listed in that annex.</p>

            <p>Second, the EU legislature considered that not all hazard classes provided for in Annex I to Regulation No 1272/2008 are necessarily of very high concern. Consequently, the fact that it did not provide that all respiratory sensitisers are, as in the case of CMR substances, to be regarded as being of very high concern, even though those substances fall within such a hazard class, shows that the intention of the EU legislature is to reserve the authorisation procedure to certain substances only, on the basis of a case-by-case analysis, and not to apply it to all substances classed as hazardous to health or to the environment.</p>

            <p>In this connection, it must be noted that Article 57(f) of the REACH Regulation does not lay down any criterion and does not provide any clarification as regards the nature of the concerns that may be taken into consideration for the purposes of identifying a substance other than CMR, PBT or vPvB. In those circumstances, it is necessary to determine whether, as Hitachi and Polynt claim, the General Court erred in law in holding that the concept of `concern', used in Article 57(f) of that regulation, is restricted to the examination of, solely, the hazards arising from the intrinsic properties of the substances concerned, to the exclusion of any other consideration.</p>

            <p>It should be observed that, if that had been the intention of the EU legislature, it would have been sufficient for it to provide, in Article 57(f) of the REACH Regulation, for example, that substances for which there is scientific evidence of probable `serious effects equivalent' to those of CMR, PBT or vPvB substances or effects `of an equivalent seriousness' to those of those substances may be identified as being of very high concern.</p>

            <p>However, it is clear from the wording of Article 57(f) of the REACH Regulation, which states that the identification of substances other than CMR, PBT or vPvB is possible only in the case of substances the serious effects of which give rise to `an equivalent level of concern' to those of CMR, PBT or vPvB substances, that the scope of that provision encompasses the possibility of taking into consideration, for the purposes of comparison, material going beyond merely the hazards arising from the intrinsic properties of the substances concerned.</p>

            <p>In this connection, it should be stated that the application of the authorisation procedure presupposes that the criteria set out in Article 57 of the REACH Regulation have already been fulfilled. Once a substance has been identified as being of very high concern, it falls within the scope of the authorisation procedure, although its formal inclusion on the list of substances subject to authorisation may be deferred depending on the degree of priority granted by the ECHA, in accordance with Article 58 of that regulation.</p>

            <p>For a substance that does not fall within the CMR, PBT or vPvB hazard categories specifically identified by the legislature as being of very high concern, its identification as such under Article 57(f) of the REACH Regulation, on account of a level of concern equivalent to those of CMR, PBT or vPvB substances, also involves ensuring that, amongst the different regimes established by that regulation, authorisation is necessary in order to succeed in controlling the risks arising from the use of that substance. Such a decision requires a range of factors to be taken into consideration, wider than those relevant for the purposes of a simple technical exercise to categorise the effects or intrinsic properties of a substance.</p>

            <p>In this connection, it must be recalled that, as regards hazards to human health, CMR substances are the only ones identified as being of very high concern, and therefore subject to the authorisation regime, solely on the basis of their classification under Annex I to Regulation No 1272/2008. It is clear from the travaux préparatoires that led to the adoption of the REACH Regulation, in particular, from point 1.7 of the proposal for a Regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council (SEC(2003) 1171 final), that that treatment is justified `because the effects of CMRs categories 1 and 2 on humans are generally so serious and cannot normally be reversed so that such effects have to be prevented rather than remedied'.</p>

            <p>The EU legislature therefore considered that, by their nature, the effects of those substances on human health give rise to concerns of such a level that differentiating them from all other substances, including those falling within other hazard classes that may result in death or other irreversible effects, is justified. In response to the Court's written questions, the ECHA and the Commission thus explained that the level of concern to which CMR substances give rise derives not only from the seriousness of their, often irreversible, effects, but also from the consequences of those effects for society and the difficulties in carrying out an assessment of their risks based on the determination of an effects threshold.</p>

            <p>Those considerations show that the REACH Regulation seeks to reserve the authorisation procedure to certain substances, identified as being of very high concern, not only on account of the seriousness of their dangerous effects on health or on the environment, but also having regard to other factors. The latter may include, apart from the probability that the serious effects of a substance may occur under the normal conditions of use of that substance, the difficulty of adequately assessing the risks posed by those substances when it is impossible to determine, with the necessary certainty, a derived no-effect level or a predicted no-effect concentration, or indeed the level of concern that those substances engender in the public, the number of persons affected, and the impact of those effects on the lives, and in particular, the professional lives, of the persons affected.</p>

Taking such data into consideration makes it possible to refine, for substances other than CMR, PBT or vPvB, the material on the basis of which recourse to the authorisation procedure appears, in the light of all the data available, to be the most appropriate course, having regard to the concerns to which their serious effects on health or on the environment give rise.</p>
