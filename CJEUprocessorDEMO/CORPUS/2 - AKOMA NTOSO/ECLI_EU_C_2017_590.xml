                <p>Member States should ensure that the ending of the illegal stay of third-country nationals is carried out through a fair and transparent procedure. According to general principles of EU law, decisions taken under this Directive should be adopted on a case-by-case basis and based on objective criteria, implying that consideration should go beyond the mere fact of an illegal stay. When using standard forms for decisions related to return, namely return decisions and, if issued, entry-ban decisions and decisions on removal, Member States should respect that principle and fully comply with all applicable provisions of this Directive. ...</p>

                <p>The effects of national return measures should be given a European dimension by establishing an entry ban prohibiting entry into and stay on the territory of all the Member States. The length of the entry ban should be determined with due regard to all relevant circumstances of an individual case and should not normally exceed five years. In this context, particular account should be taken of the fact that the third-country national concerned has already been the subject of more than one return decision or removal order or has entered the territory of a Member State during an entry ban.'</p>

            <p>By a decision of the Minister van Vreemdelingenzaken en Immigratie (Minister for Immigration and Integration, Netherlands) of 22 October 2002, Mr Ouhrami was declared undesirable. In that decision, the minister stated that, in the years 2000 to 2002, Mr Ouhrami had, on five occasions, been sentenced by the criminal courts to a total of more than 13 months imprisonment for aggravated theft, handling stolen property and possession of hard drugs. On that basis, the Minister for Immigration and Integration took the view that Mr Ouhrami represented a threat to public policy and, accordingly, declared him undesirable. As a result, Mr Ouhrami was under the obligation</p>

            <p>In the context of his appeal, Mr Ouhrami does not challenge the finding of the Gerechtshof Amsterdam (Court of Appeal, Amsterdam) that the return procedure laid down in Directive 2008/115 had been followed exhaustively in the present case. He submits, however, that that court erred in convicting him because the decision of 22 October 2002 declaring him undesirable had, in his view, ceased to produce legal effects at the time of the facts at issue in the main proceedings. In that regard, Mr Ouhrami argues that that decision had to be regarded as equivalent to an entry ban. Furthermore, given that it entered into force on being issued, or at the latest when Mr Ouhrami became aware of it, and that, pursuant to Article 11(2) of Directive 2008/115, the duration of the entry ban in the present case could not exceed five years, he claims that that ban was no longer in force in 2011 and 2012.</p>

Following the expiry of that deadline, such a declaration of undesirability must in principle comply with the maximum duration of five years laid down in Article 11(2) of that directive.

It is common ground that, following the adoption of that decision, Mr Ouhrami never left the Netherlands and that, after that deadline for transposition had passed, he was sentenced at first instance and on appeal to a term of imprisonment for failure to comply with that decision.</p>

            <p>In this regard, it must be noted that it is apparent from the provisions cited in paragraphs 43 and 44 of the present judgment, as well as from, inter alia, recital 6, Article 6(1), Article 6(6), Article 8(1), Article 8(3), the first subparagraph of Article 11(3) and Article 12(1) of Directive 2008/115 that the latter draws a clear distinction between, on the one hand, a return decision and a possible removal decision, and on the other hand, an entry ban.</p>

            <p>Thus, in accordance with Article 3(4) and Article 6(1) of Directive 2008/115, it is by means of a return decision that the initial illegal stay of the person concerned is declared to be unlawful and an obligation to return is imposed on him. Under Article 7(1) of that directive, and subject to the exceptions set out in Article 7(4) thereof, such a return decision must provide for an appropriate period within which the person concerned may depart voluntarily. In the event that such a period is not granted or the obligation to return is not complied with within the period granted, Member States are required, in accordance with Article 8(1) and Article 8(3) of Directive 2008/115, to take all necessary measures to enforce the return decision, adopting, where appropriate, a removal decision, that is to say, a separate administrative or judicial decision or act ordering enforcement of the obligation to return.</p>

            <p>It follows that, until the point in time at which the obligation to return is voluntarily complied with or enforced, and the person concerned has thus actually gone back to his country of origin, to a country of transit or to another third country, within the meaning of Article 3(3) of Directive 2008/115, the illegal stay of the person concerned is governed by the return decision and not by the entry ban. It is only from that point in time that the entry ban produces its effects, by prohibiting the person concerned, for a certain period of time following his return, from again entering and staying in the territory of the Member States.</p>

            <p>Consequently, although Article 6(6) of Directive 2008/115 opens the possibility for Member States to adopt a return decision and an entry ban at the same time, it is nevertheless clear from the general scheme of that directive that those two decisions are separate since a return decision results from the fact that the initial stay is unlawful whereas an entry ban applies to any possible subsequent stay by making it unlawful.</p>

            <p>A possible entry ban thus constitutes a means of increasing the effectiveness of the European Union's return policy by ensuring that, for a certain period after the removal of a third-country national who was staying illegally, that person can no longer lawfully return to the territory of the Member States.</p>

            <p>That objective of Article 11 of Directive 2008/115 and the general purpose pursued by that directive, as recalled in paragraph 40 of the present judgment, would be compromised if the refusal of a third-country national to comply with the obligation to return and to cooperate in the context of a removal procedure were to enable him to avoid, in whole or in part, the legal effects of an entry ban, which would be the case if the period of application of such an entry ban were to commence and possibly expire during such a removal procedure.</p>

            <p>It thus follows from the wording, general scheme and objective of Directive 2008/115 that the period of application of the entry ban does not begin to run until the date on which the person concerned has actually left the territory of the Member States.</p>

            <p>With regard to the question whether, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, Directive 2008/115 precludes the imposition of a prison sentence for the breach of a decision declaring the person concerned undesirable, where such a decision has the legal effects mentioned in paragraph 34 of this judgment, it should be noted that the Court has held that a Member State may not impose criminal sanctions for breach of an entry ban coming within the scope of Directive 2008/115 unless the continuation of the effects of that ban complies with Article 11 of that directive (see, to that effect, judgments of 19 September 2013, Filev and Osmani, C‑297/12, EU:C:2013:569, paragraph 37, and of 1 October 2015, Celaj, C‑290/14, EU:C:2015:640, paragraph 31).</p>

            <p>However, inasmuch as Mr Ouhrami did not leave the Netherlands following the adoption of the decision declaring him undesirable and, consequently, the obligation to return prescribed by that decision was never fulfilled, the person concerned is in an unlawful situation as a consequence of an initial illegal stay, and not as a consequence of a subsequent illegal stay resulting from a breach of an entry ban, within the meaning of Article 11 of Directive 2008/115.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be noted that it is settled case-law that Directive 2008/115 precludes legislation of a Member State laying down criminal penalties for initial illegal stays, in so far as that legislation permits the imprisonment of a third-country national who, though staying illegally on the territory of that Member State and not being willing to leave that territory voluntarily, has not been subject to the coercive measures referred to in Article 8 of the directive. However, the Court has pointed out that Directive 2008/115 does not preclude national legislation which permits the imprisonment of a third-country national to whom the return procedure established by the directive has been applied and who is staying illegally on the territory of the Member State without a justified ground for non-return (see, to that effect, judgments of 6 December 2011, Achughbabian, C‑329/11, EU:C:2011:807, paragraph 50, and of 7 June 2016, Affum, C‑47/15, EU:C:2016:408, paragraphs 52 and 54).</p>

            <p>From the documents before the Court it is apparent, first, that, in the main proceedings, the Gerechtshof Amsterdam (Court of Appeal, Amsterdam) held that, in the present case, the return procedure had to be regarded as exhausted and, as a result, the imposition of a prison sentence for the proven offences was not contrary to Directive 2008/115, and, secondly, that that finding, which appears to meet the conditions laid down in the case-law referred to in the previous paragraph of the present judgment, had not been contested in the appeal brought before the referring court, although this is a matter for the referring court to verify.</p>

            <p>In the light of all of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question is that Article 11(2) of Directive 2008/115 must be interpreted as meaning that the starting point of the duration of an entry ban, as referred to in that provision, which in principle may not exceed five years, must be calculated from the date on which the person concerned actually left the territory of the Member States.</p>

            </tblock>
            <p>59 As the referring court noted in its request for a preliminary ruling, the second question is posed solely in case the reply to the first question might be that the starting point of the duration of an entry ban, as provided for by Article 11(2) of Directive 2008/115, was to be calculated, not from the date on which the person concerned actually left the territory of the Member States, but from an earlier date, such as the date on which that entry ban was issued. As the Advocate General observed in point 64 of her Opinion, it is only in that event that the second question would have been relevant to the resolution of the dispute in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules: Article 11(2) of Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals must be interpreted as meaning that the starting point of the duration of an entry ban, as referred to in that provision, which in principle may not exceed five years, must be calculated from the date on which the person concerned actually left the territory of the Member States.</p>
