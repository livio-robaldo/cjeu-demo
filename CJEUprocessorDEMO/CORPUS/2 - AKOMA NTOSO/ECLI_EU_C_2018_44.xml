Since the barriers in the internal market for services affect operators who wish to become established in other Member States as well as those who provide a service in another Member State without being established there, it is necessary to enable providers to develop their service activities within the internal market either by becoming established in a Member State or by making use of the free movement of services.

That framework is based on a dynamic and selective approach consisting in the removal, as a matter of priority, of barriers which may be dismantled quickly and, for the others, the launching of a process of evaluation, consultation and complementary harmonisation of specific issues, which will make possible the progressive and coordinated modernisation of national regulatory systems for service activities which is vital in order to achieve a genuine internal market for services by 2010. Provision should be made for a balanced mix of measures involving targeted harmonisation, administrative cooperation, the provision on the freedom to provide services and encouragement of the development of codes of conduct on certain issues. That coordination of national legislative regimes should ensure a high degree of Community legal integration and a high level of protection of general interest objectives, especially protection of consumers, which is vital in order to establish trust between Member States ... ...</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must, first, be noted that the wording of those provisions does not lay down any condition as to the existence of a foreign element.

While it is true that those provisions refer to Articles 54 and 49 TFEU, that reference is made for the sole purpose of indicating that the concepts of `legal person' and `economic activities', mentioned in Article 4(2) and Article 4(5) of that directive, must be understood in the light of Articles 54 and 49 TFEU.</p>

            <p>Consequently, to ensure that the effet utile of the specific legal framework that the EU legislature intended to establish in adopting Directive 2006/123 is not undermined, it must be accepted, contrary to what was argued by the German government at the hearing, that the scope of that directive is capable of extending, in certain cases, beyond what is strictly laid down in the provisions of the FEU Treaty relating to freedom of establishment and the free movement of services, without prejudice to the obligation on the Member States, under Article 3(3) of that directive, to apply the provisions of that directive in compliance with the rules of the FEU Treaty (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 June 2015, Rina Services and Others, C‑593/13, EU:C:2015:399, paragraphs 39 and 40).</p>

            <p>The finding that the provisions of Chapter III of Directive 2006/123 are also applicable in purely internal situations is further supported by an examination of the travaux préparatoires of that directive. It is apparent from the legislative history that the proposed amendments submitted in the course of debates before the European Parliament, to the effect that Article 2(1) of that directive should be reformulated in such a way as to limit its scope solely to cross-border situations, were not adopted.</p>

            <p>As regards the fact, to which the Netherlands Government drew attention at the hearing, that Article 53(1) and Article 62 TFEU constitute the legal basis of Directive 2006/123, it must be observed that those provisions, unlike for example Articles 49 and 56 TFEU, which, however, are also to be found in Chapters 2 and 3 of Title IV of Part Three of the FEU Treaty, make no mention of any foreign element. It cannot therefore be inferred that the competence of the EU legislature to enact directives in order to make it easier for persons to take up and pursue activities as self-employed persons, on the basis of Article 53(1) and Article 62 TFEU, one such directive being Directive 2006/123 with respect to service activities, necessarily implies the existence of such an element.</p>

While that plan offers to service providers the opportunity of developing certain retail trade activities in specific geographical areas, that opportunity is derived not from an expressly worded document obtained by those providers following a procedure that they were required to undertake for that purpose, but from the approval by the municipal council of Appingedam of rules of general application to be found in that plan.</p>
