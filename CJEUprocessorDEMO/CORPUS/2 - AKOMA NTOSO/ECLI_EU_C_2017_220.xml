The person liable for payment may plead good faith when he can demonstrate that, during the period of the trading operations concerned, he has taken due care to ensure that all the conditions for the preferential treatment have been fulfilled.

            <p>The referring court considers, however, in the context of the same appeal before it, that the latter raises further questions relating to the concept of `good faith' of the person liable for payment, within the meaning of Article 220(2)(b) of the Customs Code.</p>

            <p>In that context, the tax authority maintains, according to that court, that the Administratīvā apgabaltiesa (Regional Administrative Court) held without any basis that Veloserviss had acted in good faith, so that it could not rely on Article 220(2)(b) of the Customs Code. In paragraphs 36 and 40 of the judgment of 8 November 2012, Lagura Vermögensverwaltung ( C‑438/11, EU:C:2012:703), the Court held that the assessment made by the authorities of the exporting country as to the validity of Form A certificates of origin cannot be binding upon the European Union and its Member States when the customs authorities of the importing country have doubts as to the true origin of the goods.</p>

            <p>Veloserviss contends, before the referring court, that the Administratīvā apgabaltiesa (Regional Administrative Court) was correct to apply that provision, given that, first, neither the customs authorities of the importing country nor itself, in its capacity as importer, could determine that the services of the exporting country had committed an error and, secondly, that Veloserviss had acted in good faith when providing to the tax authority the information in its possession and about which it had knowledge. To that effect, the Administratīvā apgabaltiesa (Regional Administrative Court) was entitled to rely on Commission Decision C(2012) 8694 of 30 November 2012, finding that it is justified in dispensing with post-clearance recovery in a particular case (file REC 01/2011), since the factual circumstances which led the Commission to adopt that decision are effectively the same as those of the case at issue in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>In that regard, the referring court considers that it follows from the Court's case-law relating to Article 220(2)(b) of the Customs Code, that where the exporter committed an error when providing information, it is possible to proceed to the post-clearance recovery. By contrast, if the error was committed by the customs authorities of the exporting country, which knew or should have known that the goods at issue did not satisfy the requisite conditions, the issue of an incorrect certificate must not, according to that court, cause prejudice to the importer.</p>

            <p>That court seeks clarification, however, concerning the application of Article 220(2)(b) of the Customs Code, in a case such as that before it, where an OLAF report emphasises the fact not only that the exporter provided inaccurate information to the customs authorities of the exporting country, but also that the customs authorities of the exporting country committed errors when issuing the Form A certificate of origin. It also questions to what extent it is necessary to take into consideration the legal and factual assessment carried out by OLAF.</p>

                <p>22 By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 220(2)(b) of the Customs Code must be interpreted as meaning that an importer may rely on a legitimate expectation, in accordance with that provision, in order to object to a post-clearance incurring of liability for import duties, submitting that he acted in good faith, either where not only the exporter provided incorrect information to the customs authorities of the exporting country, in particular concerning the true origin of the costs or the value of the parts which constitute the goods at issue, but also that those authorities themselves committed an error by issuing the Form A certificate of origin at issue, or where that importer failed to verify the circumstances giving rise to the issue, by the customs authorities of the exporting country, of that certificate, such as the certificates regarding the parts which constitute the goods or the role of the exporter in the manufacture of those goods.</p>

          <content eId="para_4104__content">
            <p>For the purposes of answering that question, it should be noted, first of all, that Article 220(2)(b) of the Customs Code is intended to protect the legitimate expectation of the person liable for payment that all the information and criteria on which the decision to recover or not to recover customs duties is based is correct (judgments of 18 October 2007, Agrover, C‑173/06, EU:C:2007:612, paragraph 31, and of 10 December 2015, Veloserviss, C‑427/14, EU:C:2015:803, paragraph 43).</p>

          <content eId="para_4105__content">
            <p>In that regard, it follows from the Court's settled case-law that an importer may validly claim a legitimate expectation pursuant to that provision, and thus benefit from the waiver of post-clearance recovery provided for therein, only if three cumulative conditions are fulfilled. First, it is necessary that the duties were not levied as a result of an error on the part of the competent authorities themselves, secondly, that the error committed by those authorities was such that it could not reasonably have been detected by a person liable for payment acting in good faith and, finally, that the latter complied with all the provisions laid down by the legislation in force as regards the customs declaration (see, inter alia, judgments of 18 October 2007, Agrover, C‑173/06, EU:C:2007:612, paragraph 35, and of 15 December 2011, Afasia Knits Deutschland, C‑409/10, EU:C:2011:843, paragraph 47).</p>

            <p>Those conditions, in essence, spread the risk of errors or irregularities vitiating a customs declaration on the basis of the conduct and diligence of each of the parties involved, namely the competent authorities of the exporting and importing countries, the exporter and the importer.</p>

In that case, where that importer nevertheless failed to obtain, using his best efforts, information concerning the circumstances of the issue of that certificate in order to verify whether those doubts were well-founded, it must be considered that the manifest error committed by the customs authorities of the exporting country could or should have been detected by the importer, so that he cannot submit that he acted in good faith in accordance with Article 220(2)(b) of the Customs Code.</p>

It is necessary, first of all, that those duties were not levied as a result of an error on the part of the competent authorities themselves, secondly, that that error was such that it could not reasonably have been detected by a person liable for payment acting in good faith and, finally, that that person complied with all the provisions laid down by the legislation in force as regards his customs declaration. Such a legitimate expectation is lacking, in particular, where, although there are clear reasons for doubting the accuracy of a Form A certificate of origin, an importer failed to obtain, using his best efforts, information concerning the circumstances of the issue of that certificate in order to verify whether those doubts were well founded. Such an obligation does not however mean that an importer is required, in general, to systematically verify the circumstances of the issue, by the customs authorities of the exporting country, of a Form A certificate of origin.
