                <p>The requirement of legal certainty and the need to do justice in individual cases are essential elements of an area of justice. This Regulation provides for the connecting factors which are the most appropriate to achieve these objectives. Therefore, this Regulation provides for a general rule but also for specific rules and, in certain provisions, for an ``escape clause '' which allows a departure from these rules where it is clear from all the circumstances of the case that the tort/delict is manifestly more closely connected with another country. This set of rules thus creates a flexible framework of conflict-of-law rules. Equally, it enables the court seised to treat individual cases in an appropriate manner. ...</p>

            <p>Nintendo is a multinational company active in the production and sale of video games and video game consoles, including the Wii video games console and its accessories. It is the holder of several registered Community designs relating to Wii accessories, such as the Wii remote control, the accessory known as the `Nunchuck' for the Wii remote control, which enables compatible video games to be controlled differently, the connector plug known as the `Wii Motion Plus' for the remote control, and the Balance Board, an accessory that allows the player to control the game through weight changes.</p>

            <p>It is apparent from the file submitted to the Court of Justice that BigBen Germany does not have its own stock of goods. Thus, it forwards the orders it receives from consumers to BigBen France. Supply of the allegedly infringing goods is therefore carried out from France. BigBen Germany and BigBen France also use images of goods corresponding to the protected designs held by Nintendo in the course of the lawful sale, including for the purposes of publicity, of certain other goods they sell.</p>

            <p>Nintendo takes the view that BigBen Germany and BigBen France's sale of certain goods made by BigBen France infringes its rights under the registered Community designs held by it. It also submits that those two companies cannot be recognised as having the right to use the images of the goods corresponding to those designs for their commercial activity. Consequently, it brought actions before the Landgericht Düsseldorf (Regional Court, Düsseldorf, Germany) against BigBen Germany and BigBen France seeking a declaration that they had infringed the rights conferred upon it by those designs.</p>

However, it dismissed the actions in so far as they concerned the use of the images of the goods corresponding to those designs by the defendants in the main proceedings. The Landgericht therefore ordered BigBen Germany to cease using those designs throughout the European Union and also upheld, without territorial limitation, Nintendo's supplementary claims seeking that it be sent various information, accounts and documents held by the defendants in the main proceedings, that they be ordered to pay compensation and that the destruction or recall of the goods at issue, publication of the judgment and reimbursement of the lawyers' fees incurred by Nintendo be ordered ( `the supplementary claims').</p>

            <p>In support of its action, BigBen France contends that the German courts lack jurisdiction to adopt orders against it that are applicable throughout the European Union and takes the view that such orders can have merely national territorial scope. For its part, Nintendo disputes the limitation of such orders solely to the goods within the supply chain between the defendants in the main proceedings. Nintendo also claims that the defendants in the main proceedings cannot be recognised as having the right to use, in the course of their economic activity and for the purposes of selling their own goods, the images of the goods corresponding to its registered Community designs, whereas the defendants in the main proceedings maintain that such use is in conformity with Regulation No 6/2002. Moreover, Nintendo takes the view that German law should be applied to its claims relating to BigBen Germany and French law to those relating to BigBen France, contrary to what the Landgericht Düsseldorf (Regional Court, Düsseldorf) held.</p>

That court doubts, however, in the light of the arguments set out before it both by Nintendo and BigBen France, that the scope of the judgment delivered by the Landgericht Düsseldorf (Regional Court, Düsseldorf) in respect of BigBen France, as regards Nintendo's claims, is in conformity with the provisions of Regulation No 44/2001 and Regulation No 6/2002.</p>

            <p>However, the referring court takes the view that the requirement of the same situation of law is satisfied in the cases in the main proceedings, since Nintendo's claims brought before it against the two defendants in the main proceedings arise in the same situation of law, in particular because of the unitary character of the rights conferred by a Community design, as well as in the light of the partial harmonisation of the means of enforcing intellectual property rights effected by Directive 2004/48/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the enforcement of intellectual property rights ( OJ 2004 L 157, p. 45, and corrigendum OJ 2004 L 195, p. 16).</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be noted that by bringing an action for infringement, the holder seeks to protect his exclusive right to use the Community design and to prohibit any unauthorised use of it by a third party, enshrined in Article 19 of Regulation No 6/2002. Since that right has the same effect throughout the European Union, the fact that some of the orders that may be adopted by the court having jurisdiction with a view to ensuring that that right is respected depend on provisions of national law is irrelevant to the existence of the same situation of law for the purposes of applying Article 6(1) of Regulation No 44/2001.</p>

            <p>It follows from the foregoing that the answer to the first question is that Regulation No 6/2002, read in conjunction with Article 6(1) of Regulation No 44/2001, must be interpreted as meaning that in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings where the international jurisdiction of a Community design court seised of an action for infringement is based, with regard to one defendant, on Article 82(1) of Regulation No 6/2002 and, with regard to a second defendant established in another Member State, on that Article 6(1) read in conjunction with Article 79(1) of Regulation No 6/2002, because the second defendant makes and supplies to the first defendant the goods that the latter sells, that court may, on the applicant's request, adopt orders in respect of the second defendant concerning measures falling under Article 89(1) and Article 88(2) of Regulation No 6/2002 also covering the second defendant's conduct other than that relating to the abovementioned supply chain and with a scope which extends throughout the European Union.</p>

In that regard, Article 20(1)(c) of Regulation No 6/2002 makes no reference to the law of the Member States on the concept of `citations'. However, the need for a uniform application of EU law and the principle of equality require the terms of a provision of EU law which makes no express reference to the law of the Member States for the purpose of determining its meaning and scope normally to be given an independent and uniform interpretation throughout the EU; that interpretation must take into account not only the wording of the provision but also its context and the objectives pursued by the rules of which it is part (see, inter alia, judgments of 3 September 2014, Deckmyn and Vrijheidsfonds, C‑201/13, EU:C:2014:2132, paragraph 14, and of 10 December 2015, Lazar, C‑350/14, EU:C:2015:802, paragraph 21).</p>

The Court has also already stated that the objective of that regulation is to ensure effective protection of registered Community designs (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 February 2012, Celaya Emparanza y Galdos International, C‑488/10, EU:C:2012:88, paragraph 44).</p>

On the other hand, in view of the objective of Regulation No 6/2002, referred to in paragraph 73 above, the prevention of an undertaking creating new products intended to be compatible with existing products which correspond to Community designs held by another undertaking from using images of those existing products upon the lawful sale of its own products, in order to explain or demonstrate the joint use of the two categories of products, could discourage innovation, a situation which that regulation seeks to avoid, as the Advocate General also noted in point 75 of his Opinion.</p>

            <p>In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the second question is that Article 20(1)(c) of Regulation No 6/2002 must be interpreted as meaning that a third party which, without the consent of the holder of the rights conferred by a Community design, uses, including via its website, images of goods corresponding to such designs when lawfully offering for sale goods intended to be used as accessories to the specific goods of the holder of the rights conferred by those designs, in order to explain or demonstrate the joint use of the goods thus offered for sale and the specific goods of the holder of those rights, carries out an act of reproduction for the purpose of making `citations' within the meaning of Article 20(1)(c), such an act thus being authorised under that provision provided that it fulfils the cumulative conditions laid down therein, which is for the national court to verify.</p>

            <p>While it is true that the referring court has not yet made any findings as to the existence of an infringement of the rights of the applicant in the main proceedings conferred by the Community designs, it cannot be considered, contrary to what the European Commission suggests, that the third question is consequently inadmissible. It is for the national courts alone to determine, having regard to the particular features of each case, both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable them to give their judgment and the relevance of the questions which they refer to the Court. Furthermore, the finding of such an infringement in the disputes in the main proceedings is not purely hypothetical (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 May 2017, HanseYachts, C‑29/16, EU:C:2017:343, paragraph 24).</p>

It also asks whether the law designated by virtue of that provision applies, in accordance with Article 15 of Regulation No 864/2007, to participatory acts.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, those provisions do not govern those sanctions and measures independently, but refer, as stated in paragraphs 47 and 89 of the present judgment, to the law of the Member States they designate, including their private international law. Accordingly, in so far as the private international law of the Member States, excluding the Kingdom of Denmark, concerning the conflict‑of‑law rules applicable in civil and commercial matters to non-contractual obligations, including such obligations arising from infringements of unitary Community intellectual property rights, has been harmonised through the adoption of Regulation No 864/2007 (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 January 2016, ERGO Insurance and Gjensidige Baltic, C‑359/14 and C‑475/14, EU:C:2016:40, paragraph 37), that reference must, provided that it relates to private international law, be understood as covering the provisions of that regulation.</p>

It is not clear from such wording whether that concept involves active conduct on the part of the infringing party in the country thus designated, excluding the place where that infringement has effect. In contrast, other language versions of that provision, such as the versions in Spanish, German, Italian, Lithuanian, Dutch, Portuguese, Slovenian and Swedish, are more explicit in that regard, since they refer to the law of the country where `the infringement was committed'.

            <p>As regards the general scheme and the context of Article 8(2) of Regulation No 864/2007, it is apparent from recital 16 of the regulation that uniform rules should enhance the foreseeability of court decisions and ensure a reasonable balance between the interests of the person claimed to be liable and the person who has sustained damage. To that effect, the regulation establishes as a general principle the rule of lex loci damni, enshrined in Article 4(1) thereof, by virtue of which the law applicable to a non-contractual obligation is the law of the country in which the damage occurs.</p>

Consequently, the `country in which the act of infringement was committed' within the meaning of Article 8(2) of that regulation must be interpreted as meaning that it refers to the country where the event giving rise to the damage occurred, namely the country on whose territory the act of infringement was committed.</p>

            <p>It must however be stated that proceedings relating to intellectual property rights infringements are particularly complex, as the Advocate General stated, in essence, in point 64 of his Opinion.

Council Regulation (EC) No 6/2002 of 12 December 2001 on Community designs, read in conjunction with Article 6(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, must be interpreted as meaning that in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings where the international jurisdiction of a Community design court seised of an action for infringement is based, with regard to one defendant, on Article 82(1) of Regulation No 6/2002 and, with regard to a second defendant established in another Member State, on that Article 6(1) read in conjunction with Article 79(1) of Regulation No 6/2002, because the second defendant makes and supplies to the first defendant the goods that the latter sells, that court may, on the applicant's request, adopt orders in respect of the second defendant concerning measures falling under Article 89(1) and Article 88(2) of Regulation No 6/2002 also covering the second defendant's conduct other than that relating to the abovementioned supply chain and with a scope which extends throughout the European Union. 2. Article 20(1)(c) of Regulation No 6/2002 must be interpreted as meaning that a third party which, without the consent of the holder of the rights conferred by a Community design, uses, including via its website, images of goods corresponding to such designs when lawfully offering for sale goods intended to be used as accessories to the specific goods of the holder of the rights conferred by those designs, in order to explain or demonstrate the joint use of the goods thus offered for sale and the specific goods of the holder of those rights, carries out an act of reproduction for the purpose of making `citations' within the meaning of Article 20(1)(c), such an act thus being authorised under that provision provided that it fulfils the cumulative conditions laid down therein, which is for the national court to verify. 3. Article 8(2) of Regulation (EC) No 864/2007 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 July 2007 on the law applicable to non‑contractual obligations ( `Rome II') must be interpreted as meaning that the `country in which the act of infringement was committed' within the meaning of that provision refers to the country where the event giving rise to the damage occurred. Where the same defendant is accused of various acts of infringement in various Member States, the correct approach for identifying the event giving rise to the damage is not to refer to each alleged act of infringement, but to make an overall assessment of that defendant's conduct in order to determine the place where the initial act of infringement at the origin of that conduct was committed or threatened by it.</p>
