It is against that background that Annex 9 of Governmental Decree No 410/2007 institutes fines for the offences at issue, which vary according to the category of vehicle, established on the basis of the number of the vehicle's axles, the lump-sum amount of which falls between HUF 140000 and HUF 165000 (approximately EUR 454 and EUR 535).</p>

            <p>As regards compliance with the principle of proportionality, it must be noted that the only adjustment of the fines laid down under that system, which is apparent from Governmental Decree No 410/2007, relates to the category of the vehicle concerned, which is established on the basis of its number of axles. However, such an adjustment, devoid of any connection with the conduct of the operator of the vehicle or its driver, fails to take account of the nature and gravity of the offence committed. As the European Commission notes in its written observations, the competent authority cannot, for example, take into account the distance travelled without the toll having been paid. The amount of the fine penalising the failure to comply with the payment obligation at issue in the main proceedings is therefore a flat rate and does not vary with either the kilometres travelled without authorisation or whether the offender did or did not pay a toll in advance for a specified itinerary.</p>

            <p>The Court has previously held that the imposition of flat-rate fines for all breaches of certain obligations laid down by law, without adjustment of the amount of the penalty in line with the seriousness of the breach, appears to be disproportionate in the light of the objectives pursued by the EU legislation (see judgment of 9 February 2012, Urbán, C‑210/10, EU:C:2012:64, paragraph 41).</p>

            <p>Having regard to the foregoing, the answer to the first and second questions is that Article 9a of Directive 1999/62 must be interpreted as meaning that the requirement set out therein of proportionality of the penalties which it covers precludes a system of penalties, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which provides for the imposition of a flat-rate fine for all offences, whatever their nature and gravity, under the rules on the obligation to make prior payment of the toll for use of a road infrastructure.</p>

              <p>The third question</p>
            </tblock>
            <p>51 By its third question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 9a of Directive 1999/62 must be interpreted as meaning that the requirement of proportionality referred to therein precludes, on the one hand, a system of penalties, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which imposes strict liability on persons committing offences and, on the other, the level of the penalties provided for under that system.</p>

            <p>It must be borne in mind that it is apparent from the file submitted to the Court that Annex 9 to Governmental Decree No 410/2007 places the national authorities responsible for its implementation in a situation of circumscribed powers as regards the flat-rate amount of the fine laid down in respect of an offence under the Law on road tolls. Accordingly, those authorities are not able to take account of the actual and specific circumstances of each case and, thus, adjust that amount to those circumstances.</p>

            <p>With regard, firstly, to the compatibility of the institution of strict liability with the principle of proportionality, the Court has already ruled on a number of occasions that such a system penalising breaches of EU law is not in itself incompatible with that law (see, inter alia, judgment of 9 February 2012, Urbán, C‑210/10, EU:C:2012:64, paragraph 47 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>According to the Court, the imposition of a system of strict liability is not disproportionate in relation to the objectives pursued if that system is such as to encourage the persons concerned to comply with the provisions of a regulation and where the objective pursued is a matter of public interest which may justify the introduction of such a system (judgment of 9 February 2012, Urbán, C‑210/10, EU:C:2012:64, paragraph 48 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Next, it must be borne in mind that Directive 1999/62 requires the national legislatures to impose payment of a fee on heavy goods vehicles for the use of the road infrastructures. The national system at issue in the main proceedings, which transposes that directive, thus provides that the operators of those vehicles are required to pay a fee to use those infrastructures and institutes a penalty mechanism intended to ensure compliance with the payment obligation. Under the national legislation, there is an infringement of that obligation when the user of a tolled road infrastructure failed to pay, before using it, the required amount of the toll. Such a system of strict liability thus encourages the operators of heavy goods vehicles in circulation to make prior payment of the amount of the toll which they are due to pay.</p>

            <p>Given that, on the one hand, that system of strict liability is such as to encourage vehicle operators to comply with the obligations of prior payment of the fees due in respect of the use of the road infrastructure and, on the other, the objectives pursued by the Hungarian legislation, namely those of combating distortions of competition between transport undertakings and applying the `polluter pays' principle, are in the public interest, the institution, by that legislation, of a system of strict liability may be regarded as justified.</p>

            <p>Secondly, with regard to the setting of the amount of the fine corresponding to each type of offence, provided for by the system of penalties at issue in the main proceedings, it is appropriate to recall the case-law cited in paragraphs 39 and 40 of the present judgment, according to which the Member States are empowered to choose the sanctions which seem to them to be appropriate. The Member States are, however, required to exercise that power in accordance with EU law and its general principles, and consequently in accordance with the principle of proportionality. Measures imposing penalties must not, therefore, inter alia, exceed the limits of what is necessary in order to attain the objectives legitimately pursued by the legislation in question or be disproportionate to those aims.</p>

            <p>It must be recalled in that regard that the Member States are required to comply with the principle of proportionality not only as regards the determination of factors constituting an infringement and the determination of the rules concerning the severity of fines, but also as regards the assessment of the factors which may be taken into account in the fixing of a fine (see, inter alia, judgments of 9 February 2012, Urbán, C‑210/10, EU:C:2012:64, paragraph 54, and of 19 October 2016, EL-EM-2001, C‑501/14, EU:C:2016:777, paragraph 41).</p>

            <p>That having been said, it must be stated that the obligation on the national authorities responsible for penalising infringements of the obligations to pay the fees for the use of a road infrastructure to impose a fine at a flat rate of between HUF 140000 and HUF 165000 (approximately EUR 454 to EUR 535), without being able to take account of the actual circumstances of the individual case or, if appropriate, to reduce the amount of that fine, does not satisfy the conditions required by the case-law referred to in paragraphs 39 and 40 of the present judgment.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be pointed out that it is not in dispute that, firstly, in Case C‑497/15, the driver of the vehicle concerned, because of an error in the navigation system, passed the exit by which he ought to have left the motorway to continue his journey on a lower category road, for which he held a road use authorisation. That driver therefore travelled approximately 5km on that motorway without having first paid the toll, the section in question being parallel to the lower category road. The amount due in respect of the 5km section travelled on the motorway was lower than that invoiced for use of the comparable section of the lower category road. As the referring court has found, Euro-Team did not either obtain any advantage or cause any financial loss to the State budget by that offence.</p>

            <p>Secondly, in Case C‑498/15, the driver of the vehicle in question, who held a ticket authorising him to use a road infrastructure for a different itinerary, paid the amount of the toll required on his own initiative, after having realised his mistake and stopped his vehicle on the hard shoulder of the motorway, since he could not make a U-turn. In that case, it is clear from the order for reference that that driver used a motorway in error for 20 minutes, because he had failed to take his intended exit. In that case, too, in accordance with the findings of the referring court, Spirál-Gép neither obtained any advantage nor caused any loss.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, firstly, with regard to the condition that a measure imposing a penalty must not exceed the limits of what is necessary in order to attain the objectives legitimately pursued by the legislation at issue in the main proceedings, it must be stated that it would also be possible for the competent national authorities to achieve the objectives pursued through the use of less restrictive measures, given that the offences committed did not adversely affect the objectives pursued by Directive 1999/62, namely the harmonisation of levy systems and the establishment of fair mechanisms for charging infrastructure costs to hauliers in order to eliminate distortions of competition between transport undertakings in the Member States.</p>

            <p>Secondly, with regard to the condition that the measure imposing a penalty must not be disproportionate to the aims pursued, it is apparent from the order for reference in Case C‑497/15 that the amount of the fine imposed on Euro-Team is more than 500 times greater than the amount of the unpaid toll, which is lower than the amount actually paid for the comparable section of the No 5 main road. In Case C‑498/15, the referring court states that that amount is more than 87 times greater than the amount of the toll paid out of time. Consequently, the severity of the penalty appears, in the main proceedings, to be disproportionate to the offence committed.</p>
