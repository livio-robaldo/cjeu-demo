                <p>The rules of jurisdiction should be highly predictable and founded on the principle that jurisdiction is generally based on the defendant's domicile. Jurisdiction should always be available on this ground save in a few well-defined situations in which the subject matter of the dispute or the autonomy of the parties warrants a different connecting factor. The domicile of a legal person must be defined autonomously so as to make the common rules more transparent and avoid conflicts of jurisdiction.</p>

                <p>In addition to the defendant's domicile, there should be alternative grounds of jurisdiction based on a close connection between the court and the action or in order to facilitate the sound administration of justice. The existence of a close connection should ensure legal certainty and avoid the possibility of the defendant being sued in a court of a Member State which he could not reasonably have foreseen. This is important, particularly in disputes concerning non-contractual obligations arising out of violations of privacy and rights relating to personality, including defamation.'</p>

            <p>Mr Benkö, an Austrian national domiciled in Austria, instituted proceedings before the Landesgericht St. Pölten (Regional Court, St. Pölten, Austria) against his former partner, Ms Kareda, an Estonian national who currently lives at an unknown address in Estonia, seeking the reimbursement of EUR 17145.41, plus interest and costs. According to the order for reference, while living together in Austria, in 2007, Mr Benkö and Ms Kareda bought a one-family house for EUR 190000, and are thus each half-owners of the property. Lacking resources of their own, in March 2007 they took out three loans, for EUR 150000, EUR 100000 and EUR 50000, from an Austrian bank in order to finance that purchase and the necessary construction works. Both Mr Benkö and Ms Kareda were borrowers in respect of each of those loans.</p>

            <p>At the end of 2011, Ms Kareda ended her cohabitation with Mr Benkö and went to live in Estonia, in a place unknown to the applicant. It appears that, from June 2012 onwards, she ceased to meet her loan repayment obligations, and that, from that time, Mr Benkö alone has met the monthly repayments for those loans. In his action, Mr Benkö is therefore seeking, pursuant to Paragraph 1042 of the ABGB, reimbursement from Ms Kareda of the payments which he made on her behalf for the period up to and including June 2014.</p>

            <p>The representative appointed to accept service on behalf of Ms Kareda raised an objection of lack of jurisdiction on the basis that Ms Kareda was domiciled in Estonia. In the view of the representative, the facts set out by Mr Benkö did not come within the scope of Sections 2 to 7 of Chapter II of Regulation No 1215/2012. Furthermore, in his opinion, the court before which the action was brought did not have territorial jurisdiction, particularly since the place where the bank which granted the loans at issue had its registered office, which is accordingly the place of performance of the obligation to repay those loans, was not within the territorial jurisdiction of the Landesgericht St. Pölten (Regional Court, St. Pölten).</p>

                <p>26 By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 7(1) of Regulation No 1215/2012 must be interpreted as meaning that a recourse claim between jointly and severally liable debtors under a credit agreement constitutes a `matter relating to a contract', as referred to in that provision.</p>

          <content eId="para_10459__content">
            <p>For the purposes of answering that question, reference should be made to the interpretation given by the Court concerning Article 5(1) of Regulation No 44/2001 and Article 5(1) of the Brussels Convention, which also applies to Article 7(1) of Regulation No 1215/2012 given that those provisions may be regarded as equivalent (see, to that effect, judgment of 18 July 2013, ÖFAB, C‑147/12, EU:C:2013:490, paragraph 28).</p>

            <p>It is apparent from that case-law, first, that the concept of `matters relating to a contract', within the meaning of Article 5(1) of Regulation No 44/2001, must be interpreted autonomously in order to ensure that that concept is applied uniformly in all Member States and, secondly, that, in order to come within the scope of that concept, the claimant's action must place in issue a legal obligation freely consented to by one person towards another (see, to that effect, judgments of 14 March 2013, Česká spořitelna, C‑419/11, EU:C:2013:165, paragraphs 45 to 47, and of 28 January 2015, Kolassa, C‑375/13, EU:C:2015:37, paragraphs 37 and 39).</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be recalled at the outset that the linking factors set out in Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation No 44/2001 apply to all claims founded on one and the same contract (see, to that effect, judgment of 9 July 2009, Rehder, C‑204/08, EU:C:2009:439, paragraph 33).</p>

          <content eId="para_10462__content">
            <p>Secondly, in the case where non-performance of a contract is relied upon to support a claimant's action, all obligations arising under that contract must be considered to come within the concept of matters relating to a contract (see, to that effect, judgments of 6 October 1976, De Bloos, 14/76, EU:C:1976:134, paragraphs 16 and 17, and of 8 March 1988, Arcado, 9/87, EU:C:1988:127, paragraph 13).</p>

          <content eId="para_10463__content">
            <p>The same applies to obligations arising between two jointly and severally liable debtors, such as the parties to the main proceedings, and in particular to the possibility for a jointly and severally liable debtor who has paid, in whole or in part, the other debtor's share in the common debt to reclaim the amount thus paid by bringing a recourse claim (see, by analogy, judgment of 12 October 2016, Kostanjevec, C‑185/15, EU:C:2016:763, paragraph 38). As the Advocate General has observed in point 31 of his Opinion, given that the purpose of the action in the main proceedings is itself linked to the existence of that contract, it would be artificial, for the purposes of the application of Regulation No 1215/2012, to separate those legal relationships from the contract which gave rise to them and on which they are based.</p>

          <content eId="para_10464__content">
            <p>Finally, even though the provisions of Regulation No 1215/2012 must be interpreted in the light of the objectives of that regulation and the system which it establishes (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 January 2014, Kainz, C‑45/13, EU:C:2014:7, paragraph 19), it is necessary to take into account the objective of consistency in application, particularly in regard to Regulation No 1215/2012 and the Rome I Regulation (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 January 2016, ERGO Insurance and Gjensidige Baltic, C‑359/14 and C‑475/14, EU:C:2016:40, paragraph 43). An interpretation to the effect that a recourse action, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, must be regarded as being covered by the concept of `matters relating to a contract', within the meaning of Regulation No 1215/2012, is also consistent with that objective of consistency. Indeed, Article 16 of the Rome I Regulation expressly links the relationship between a number of debtors to that between the debtor and the creditor.</p>

            <p>In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the first question is that Article 7(1) of Regulation No 1215/2012 must be interpreted as meaning that a recourse claim between jointly and severally liable debtors under a credit agreement constitutes a `matter relating to a contract', as referred to in that provision.</p>

            <p>34 By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the second indent of Article 7(1)(b) of Regulation No 1215/2012 must be interpreted as meaning that a credit agreement, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, concluded between a credit institution and two jointly and severally liable debtors, must be classified as a `contract for the provision of services' for the purposes of that provision.</p>

          <content eId="para_10466__content">
            <p>According to the Court's case-law, the concept of `services', within the meaning of Article 5(1)(b) of Regulation No 44/2001, the wording of which is identical to that of Article 7(1)(b) of Regulation No 1215/2012, implies, at the least, that the party who provides the service carries out a particular activity in return for remuneration (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 July 2016, Granarolo, C‑196/15, EU:C:2016:559, paragraph 37 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_10467__content">
            <p>As the Advocate General has observed in point 40 of his Opinion, in a credit agreement between a credit institution and a borrower, the supply of services lies in the transfer of a sum of money by the credit institution to the borrower, in return for fees paid by the borrower, in principle, in the form of interest.</p>

            <p>It must therefore be held that such a credit agreement must be classified as a `contract for the provision of services', within the meaning of the second indent of Article 7(1)(b) of Regulation No 1215/2012.</p>

            <p>39 By its third question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the second indent of Article 7(1)(b) of Regulation No 1215/2012 must be interpreted as meaning that, where a credit institution grants a loan to two jointly and severally liable debtors, the `place in a Member State where, under the contract, the services were provided or should have been provided', within the meaning of that provision, is, unless otherwise agreed, the place where that institution has its registered office, and whether this also applies with a view to determining the territorial jurisdiction of the court called upon to hear and determine an action for recourse between those debtors.</p>

            <p>In this regard, it is necessary to establish, in accordance with the case-law of the Court, the obligation which characterises the contract (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 July 2016, Granarolo, C‑196/15, EU:C:2016:559, paragraph 33).</p>

            <p>As the Advocate General has observed in point 45 of his Opinion, in the context of a credit agreement, the characteristic obligation is the actual granting of the sum loaned, while the borrower's obligation to repay that sum is merely a consequence of the performance of the service by the lender.</p>

As the Court has pointed out in relation to Articles 15 and 16 of Regulation No 44/2001, those rules cannot apply to relations between two consumers (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 December 2013, Vapenik, C‑508/12, EU:C:2013:790, paragraph 34).</p>

Article 7(1) of Regulation (EU) No 1215/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2012 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters must be interpreted as meaning that a recourse claim between jointly and severally liable debtors under a credit agreement constitutes a `matter relating to a contract', as referred to in that provision. 2.
