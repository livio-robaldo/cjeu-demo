            <p>The Deputy Director of the DAB explained, inter alia, that, although doubts concerning respect for fundamental rights in the Gaza Strip were justified, the mere fact that Ms Alheto is a woman who informs other women residing in the Gaza Strip of their rights is not sufficient to find that there is a real risk of persecution within the meaning of Article 8 of the ZUB or of serious harm within the meaning of Article 9 of that law. In that regard, an international report drawn up in 2014 shows that, in the Gaza Strip, policewomen play a role in important work such as the prevention of drug-related crime, criminal prosecutions and monitoring freedom of movement. In those circumstances, it is difficult to believe that Ms Alheto's activity exposes her to serious and individual threats</p>

            <p>The fact remains that, while the first paragraph of Article 52 of Directive 2013/32 authorised Member States to apply those provisions to applications for international protection lodged before 20 July 2015, it did not require them to do so. Since that provision, by using the words `started after 20 July 2015 or an earlier date', offers various possibilities as regards temporal applicability, it is important, in order for the principles of legal certainty and equality before the law to be observed in the implementation of EU law and for applicants for international protection to be protected from arbitrariness and to have a right to an effective remedy in the context of procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection, that each Member State bound by that directive should process applications for international protection lodged within the same period on its territory in a predictable and uniform manner.</p>

However, based on the assumption that the national provision that has in the meantime transposed that ground of inadmissibility is nevertheless applicable ratione temporis to the main proceedings, an assumption which it is for the referring court alone to confirm, that court correctly asks whether it may, in the context of a full and ex nunc examination, as laid down in Article 46(3) of Directive 2013/32, assess the admissibility of the application for international protection at issue in the main proceedings in the light of such a ground of inadmissibility and, if so, what scope should be afforded to that ground of inadmissibility.</p>

            <p>As is apparent from the order for reference, this question arises on account of the fact that the Deputy Director of the DAB failed specifically to examine, in the contested decision, whether the protection or assistance which the applicant in the main proceedings received from UNRWA in the area of operations of that agency had ceased, in circumstances where, had that fact been established, she would potentially have been eligible, in Bulgaria, for refugee status in accordance with Article 1(D) of the Geneva Convention and Article 12(1)(a) of Directive 2011/95.</p>

That said, it follows from the second sentence of Article 12(1)(a) of Directive 2011/95, which corresponds to the second paragraph of Article 1(D) of the Geneva Convention, that, when an applicant for international protection in the European Union no longer receives protection or assistance from UNRWA, that exclusion ceases to apply.</p>

            <p>As the Court has held, the second sentence of Article 12(1)(a) of Directive 2011/95 applies where it becomes evident, based on an assessment, on an individual basis, of all the relevant evidence, that the personal safety of the Palestinian concerned is at serious risk and that it is impossible for UNRWA, whose assistance was requested by that person, to guarantee that the living conditions of that individual would be compatible with its mission, and that person is forced to leave the UNRWA area of operations owing circumstances beyond his control. In that case, that Palestinian may, unless he or she falls within the scope of any of the grounds for exclusion set out in Article 12(1)(b), Article 12(2) and Article 12(3) of that directive, ipso facto be entitled to the benefits of that directive, without necessarily having to demonstrate a well-founded fear of being persecuted, within the meaning of Article 2(d) of that directive, until the time when he is able to return to the territory of former habitual residence (judgment of 19 December 2012, Abed El Karem El Kott and Others, C‑364/11, EU:C:2012:826, paragraphs 49 to 51, 58 to 65, 75 to 77 and 81).</p>

            <p>It follows from the information recalled above that Article 12(1)(a) of Directive 2011/95 sets out, first, a ground for exclusion from refugee status and, second, a ground for no longer applying that ground for exclusion, both of which may be decisive for the purpose of assessing whether the Palestinian in question is entitled to access to refugee status in the European Union. As the Advocate General essentially noted in points 43 to 45 of his Opinion, the rules laid down in that provision, as interpreted by the Court, therefore constitute a lex specialis. The national provisions transposing that set of rules must be applied to an application for international protection lodged by a person registered with UNRWA, providing that that application has not previously been rejected on the basis of another ground for exclusion or of inadmissibility.</p>

            <p>That finding is borne out by the purpose of Directive 2011/95. Since that directive was adopted on the basis, inter alia, of Article 78(2)(a) TFEU and therefore seeks, in accordance with that provision, to establish a uniform asylum system, it is essential that all the authorities that are empowered in the European Union to deal with applications for international protection apply, when the applicant is a person registered with UNRWA, the provisions transposing the rules set out in Article 12(1)(a) of that directive.</p>

            <p>Those provisions must also be applied when, as in the present case, the application for international protection includes, in addition to an application for refugee status, an application for subsidiary protection. As is apparent from Article 10(2) of Directive 2013/32, when examining an application for international protection, the competent authority must first determine whether the applicant qualifies as a refugee. Consequently, the fact that the rules set out in Article 12(1)(a) of Directive 2011/95 do not apply to the part of the application relating to subsidiary protection does not exempt the competent authority from its obligation first to apply the provisions transposing those rules, in order to verify whether refugee status must be granted.</p>

The procedure before a determining authority is governed by the provisions of Chapter III of that directive, entitled `Procedures at first instance', while the procedure before a court or tribunal must comply with the rules laid down in Chapter V of that directive, entitled `Appeals procedures' which is made up of Article 46.</p>

            <p>In that scenario, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, as an independent State whose territory is separate from that of the habitual residence of the person concerned, would constitute, by virtue of its agreement to readmit the person concerned, of its recognition of the effective protection or assistance provided by UNRWA in its territory, and of its adherence to the principle of non-refoulement, a State actor of protection, within the meaning of Article 7(1)(a) of Directive 2011/95, and would satisfy all the conditions required by point (b) of the first paragraph of Article 35 of Directive 2013/32 in order to fall within the concept of `first country of asylum', referred to in that provision.</p>

                </tblock>
                <p>144 By its sixth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 46(3) of Directive 2013/32, read in conjunction with Article 47 of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that the court or tribunal seised at first instance of an appeal against a decision concerning an application for international protection must, in the event that it annuls that decision, rule itself on that application for international protection by granting or rejecting it.</p>

          <content eId="para_16938__content">
            <p>In that regard, it must be noted that Article 46(3) of Directive 2013/32 only concerns the `examination' of the appeal and does not therefore govern what happens after any annulment of the decision under appeal.</p>

            <p>Thus, by adopting Directive 2013/32, the EU legislature did not intend to introduce any common rule to the effect that the quasi-judicial or administrative body referred to in Article 2(f) of that directive should be deprived of its powers following the annulment of its initial decision concerning an application for international protection. It therefore remains open to the Member States to provide that the file must, following such an annulment, be referred back to that body for a new decision.</p>

            <p>However, Article 46(3) of Directive 2013/32 would be deprived of any practical effect if it were accepted that, after delivery of a judgment by which the court or tribunal of first instance conducted, in accordance with that provision, a full and ex nunc assessment of the international protection needs of the applicant by virtue of Directive 2011/95, that body could take a decision that ran counter to that assessment or could allow a considerable period of time to elapse, which could increase the risk that evidence requiring a new up-to-date assessment might arise.</p>

            <p>Consequently, even though the purpose of Directive 2013/32 is not to establish a common standard in respect of the power to adopt a new decision on an application for international protection after the annulment of the initial decision, it nevertheless follows from its purpose of ensuring the fastest possible processing of applications of that nature, from the obligation to ensure that Article 46(3) is effective, and from the need, arising from Article 47 of the Charter, to ensure an effective remedy, that each Member State bound by that directive must order its national law in such a way that, following annulment of the initial decision and in the event of the file being referred back to the quasi-judicial or administrative body referred to in Article 2(f) of that directive, a new decision is adopted within a short period of time and complies with the assessment contained in the judgment annulling the initial decision.</p>

            <p>It follows that the answer to the sixth question is that Article 46(3) of Directive 2013/32, read in conjunction with Article 47 of the Charter, must be interpreted as meaning that it does not establish common procedural standards in respect of the power to adopt a new decision concerning an application for international protection following the annulment, by the court hearing the appeal, of the initial decision taken on that application. However, the need to ensure that Article 46(3) of that directive has a practical effect and to ensure an effective remedy in accordance with Article 47 of the Charter requires that, in the event that the file is referred back to the quasi-judicial or administrative body referred to in Article 2(f) of that directive, a new decision must be adopted within a short period of time and must comply with the assessment contained in the judgment annulling the initial decision.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 12(1)(a) of Directive 2011/95/EU of 13 December 2011 on standards for the qualification of third-country nationals or stateless persons as beneficiaries of international protection, for a uniform status for refugees or for persons eligible for subsidiary protection, and for the content of the protection granted, read in conjunction with Article 10(2) of Directive 2013/32/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 on common procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection must be interpreted as meaning that the processing of an application for international protection lodged by a person registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) requires an examination of the question whether that person receives effective protection or assistance from that agency, provided that that application has not been previously rejected on the basis of a ground of inadmissibility or on the basis of a ground for exclusion other than that laid down in the first sentence of Article 12(1)(a) of Directive 2011/95. 2. The second sentence of Article 12(1)(a) of Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted and the second sentence of Article 12(1)(a) of Directive 2011/95 must be interpreted as:</p>

                <p>being applicable even if the applicant for international protection has not expressly referred to them. 3. Article 46(3) of Directive 2013/32, read in conjunction with Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, must be interpreted as meaning that a court or tribunal of a Member State seised at first instance of an appeal against a decision relating to an application for international protection must examine both facts and points of law, such as the applicability of Article 12(1)(a) of Directive 2011/95 to the applicant's circumstances, which the body that took that decision took into account or could have taken into account, and those which arose after the adoption of that decision. 4. Article 46(3) of Directive 2013/32, read in conjunction with Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, must be interpreted as meaning that the requirement for a full andex nuncexamination of the facts and points of law may also concern the grounds of inadmissibility of the application for international protection referred to in Article 33(2) of that directive, where permitted under national law, and that, in the event that the court or tribunal hearing the appeal plans to examine a ground of inadmissibility which has not been examined by the determining authority, it must conduct a hearing of the applicant in order to allow that individual to express his or her point of view in person concerning the applicability of that ground to his or her particular circumstances. 5. Point (b) of the first paragraph of Article 35 of Directive 2013/32 must be interpreted as meaning that a person registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) must, if he or she is a beneficiary of effective protection or assistance from that agency in a third country that is not the territory in which he or she habitually resides but which forms part of the area of operations of that agency, be considered as enjoying sufficient protection in that third country, within the meaning of that provision, when it:</p>

Article 46(3) of Directive 2013/32, read in conjunction with Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, must be interpreted as meaning that it does not establish common procedural standards in respect of the power to adopt a new decision concerning an application for international protection following the annulment, by the court hearing the appeal, of the initial decision taken on that application.
