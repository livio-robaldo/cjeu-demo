            <p>The appellants note that the Court of Justice recently confirmed, in its judgment of 17 September 2015, Total v Commission ( C‑597/13 P, EU:C:2015:613), that, where the liability of a parent company is derived entirely from that of its subsidiary, the liability of the former cannot exceed that of the latter. In such situations, where the parent company has lodged an appeal with the same object as the subsidiary's, the parent company must benefit from the partial or full annulment of the fine imposed on the subsidiary.</p>

            <p>Thus, the annulment of the fines imposed on Akzo Nobel Chemicals GmbH and Akzo Nobel Chemicals BV should have led to the annulment of the fine imposed on Akzo Nobel, as parent company, for the first infringement period, since that fine was imposed on it only on account of its subsidiaries' direct participation in the infringements. Akzo Nobel's liability was therefore purely derivative of that of its subsidiaries, within the meaning of the judgment of 22 January 2013, Commission v Tomkins ( C‑286/11 P, EU:C:2013:29).</p>

However, as a general rule, the Court's reasoning is based on the premiss that, in a situation where the liability of the parent company is wholly derived from the actions of its subsidiary, to apply, in respect of the parent company, a fine which exceeds that for which its subsidiary is ultimately liable is tantamount to imposing a portion of a fine for which there is no legal basis.</p>

            <p>On that aspect, in the particular case in which a parent company holds all or almost all of the capital in a subsidiary which has committed an infringement of the EU competition rules, there is a rebuttable presumption that that parent company actually exercises a decisive influence over its subsidiary (see, to that effect, judgment of 26 November 2013, Groupe Gascogne v Commission, EU:C:2013:770, paragraph 38).</p>

            <p>As has been observed in paragraph 49 of the present judgment, EU competition law is based on the principle of the personal responsibility of the economic unit which has committed the infringement. Thus, if the parent company is part of that economic unit, it is regarded as personally jointly and severally liable with the other legal persons making up that unit for the infringement committed (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 September 2009, Akzo Nobel and Others v Commission, C‑97/08 P, EU:C:2009:536, paragraph 77).</p>

            <p>In the fourth place, according to the case-law of the Court, in a situation in which the parent company's liability results exclusively from the direct participation of its subsidiary in the infringement and the two companies have brought parallel actions having the same object, the General Court may, without ruling ultra petita, take account of the annulment of the finding that the subsidiary committed an infringement for a certain period and make a corresponding reduction in the amount of the fine imposed on the parent company jointly and severally with its subsidiary (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 January 2013, Commission v Tomkins, C‑286/11 P, EU:C:2013:29, paragraphs 34, 38, 39 and 49).</p>

In that situation, the parent company's liability arises from its subsidiary's unlawful conduct, which is attributed to the parent company in view of the economic unit formed by those companies.

            <p>For the same reasons, the Court has made clear that, in a situation in which no factor individually reflects the conduct for which the parent company is held liable, the reduction of the amount of the fine imposed on the subsidiary jointly and severally with its parent company must, in principle, where the necessary procedural requirements are satisfied, be extended to the parent company (see, to that effect, judgment of 17 September 2015, Total v Commission, C‑597/13 P, EU:C:2015:613, paragraphs 10, 37, 38, 41 and 44).</p>

            <p>In the fifth place, it is apparent from the case-law of the Court that the Commission's power to impose penalties can be time-barred vis-à-vis the subsidiary but not the parent company, even though the parent company's liability may be entirely based on the unlawful conduct of that subsidiary (see, to that effect, judgment of 29 March 2011, ArcelorMittal Luxembourg v Commission and Commission v ArcelorMittal Luxembourgand Others, C‑201/09 P and C‑216/09 P, EU:C:2011:190, paragraphs 102, 103, 148 and 149).</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is common ground, as is evident from Article 1 of the decision at issue, that Akzo Nobel Chemicals GmbH and Akzo Nobel Chemicals BV participated directly in the cartels in question, from 24 February 1987 until 28 June 1993, in the case of the former, and from 11 September 1991 until 28 June 1993, in the case of the latter company.</p>

            <p>It is also common ground that, during the first infringement period, Akzo Nobel indirectly owned the entire share capital of Akzo Nobel Chemicals GmbH and of Akzo Nobel Chemicals BV and exercised decisive influence over them, with the result that, during that infringement period, the three companies formed one and the same undertaking for the purposes of EU competition law.</p>

            <p>Consequently, in accordance with the case-law referred to in paragraphs 52 to 58 of the present judgment, the unlawful actions taken by Akzo Nobel Chemicals GmbH and Akzo Nobel Chemicals BV during the first infringement period were attributed to Akzo Nobel. Akzo Nobel was thus held individually liable for actions contrary to EU competition rules which it was itself deemed to have taken during that period.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, it is also undisputed in the present case that Akzo Nobel was held liable because of its participation in the infringements at issue throughout the three infringement periods, that is to say, from 24 February 1987 until 21 March 2000, in the case of the infringement relating to tin stabilisers, and from 11 September 1991 until 22 March 2000, as regards the infringement relating to the ESBO/esters sector, as the ultimate parent company of the Akzo undertaking the various legal entities of which, including Akzo Nobel Chemicals GmbH and Akzo Nobel Chemicals BV, had participated directly in the cartels.</p>

            <p>It is important to note in this regard that the applicants at first instance had relied, before the General Court, on the expiry of the limitation period provided for in Article 25(1)(b) of Regulation No 1/2003 only with respect to Akzo Nobel Chemicals GmbH and Akzo Nobel Chemicals BV, on the ground that their unlawful conduct had ceased on 28 June 1993.</p>

            <p>As has been noted in paragraphs 40 and 41 of the present judgment, the General Court accepted the arguments of the applicants at first instance, ruling that the Commission's power to impose fines on Akzo Nobel Chemicals GmbH and Akzo Nobel Chemicals BV was time-barred.</p>

            <p>Admittedly, as the General Court in essence underlined in paragraphs 125 and 126 of the judgment under appeal, the fact that the Commission's power to impose penalties is time-barred pursuant to Article 25(1)(b) of Regulation No 1/2003 means that a penalty can no longer be imposed on the companies in respect of which the limitation period has expired.</p>

          <content eId="para_6385__content">
            <p>By contrast, the fact that penalties can no longer be imposed on certain companies because the limitation period has expired does not preclude another company, which is considered personally responsible and jointly and severally liable with those companies for the same anticompetitive behaviour, and in respect of which the limitation period has not expired, from having proceedings instituted against it.</p>

          <content eId="para_6386__content">
            <p>Contrary to the appellants' contention, the fact that Akzo Nobel's liability in respect of the first infringement period arises exclusively from the direct participation of its subsidiaries in the cartels does not alter that conclusion.</p>

            <p>First, the anticompetitive activities in relation to the first infringement period are nevertheless regarded as having been carried out by Akzo Nobel itself, since it formed an economic unit, within the meaning of the case-law of the European Union, with Akzo Nobel Chemicals GmbH and Akzo Nobel Chemicals BV.</p>

          <content eId="para_6388__content">
            <p>Secondly, as the Advocate General stated, in essence, in points 58 and 59 of his Opinion, it is apparent from the case-law of the Court mentioned in paragraph 62 of the present judgment that factors specific to the parent company may justify assessing the parent company's liability and that of its subsidiary differently, even if the liability of the former is based exclusively on the unlawful conduct of the latter.</p>

          <content eId="para_6389__content">
            <p>That is the case here, since, unlike Akzo Nobel Chemicals GmbH and Akzo Nobel Chemicals BV, whose participation in the cartels ended on 28 June 1993, Akzo Nobel, as has been noted in paragraph 67 of the present judgment, was involved in the infringements in question beyond that date, until 21 and 22 March 2000, as regards the infringement concerning the tin stabilisers sector and the infringement concerning the ESBO/esters sector, respectively.</p>

            <p>Having regard to all of those considerations, it must be concluded that the General Court was fully entitled to find, in paragraph 126 of the judgment under appeal, that the fact that the Commission's power to impose penalties on Akzo Nobel Chemicals GmbH and Akzo Nobel Chemicals BV was time-barred did not preclude Akzo Nobel from being held liable in respect of the first infringement period.</p>
