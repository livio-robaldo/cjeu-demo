            <p>Mr Teglgaard relies on the wording of Article 6(1) of Regulation No 1782/2003 to argue that the year of reduction of the direct payments is that of the non-compliance with the cross-compliance rules. Regulation No 796/2004 merely specifies that non-compliance with the cross-compliance rules cannot be penalised before it has been found and cannot amend Regulation No 1782/2003. He states that, in accordance with the general principles of law, the penalty for that non-compliance must be imposed having regard to the circumstances existing at the material time. In his submission, Regulation No 73/2009 cannot serve as the basis for a request to reduce aid resulting from events occurring before its entry into force. Furthermore, he points out that the alleged non-compliance with the cross-compliance rules would have unpredictable consequences for him, in that the penalty could be increased by a sum of DKK 1 908 483.08 (Danish krone; approximately EUR 256157) due to the increase of the area eligible for direct payments between the year of that non-compliance and the year of the finding thereof.</p>

            <p>Fløjstrupgård submits that Article 23 of Regulation No 73/2009 does not indicate clearly whether the reduction in direct payments must relate to those received in the year during which the non-compliance with the cross-compliance rules occurred or to those received in the year in which the non-compliance was found. It points out that, in its case, the reduction in direct payments is greater if it relates to the year when the non-compliance was found, because of the increase in areas eligible for those payments between the year in which it took place and that of its finding. Such a situation would be contrary to the principles of legal certainty and the protection of legitimate expectations and, from the point of view of contract law, would constitute an unforeseeable consequence.</p>

            <p>According to the Complaints Centre of the Ministry of Food, the EU regulations relating to the single payment scheme pursue the specific objective of incentivising farmers to comply with the existing legislation in the various fields of cross-compliance, since the provisions relating to this scheme are to be interpreted in the light of that objective. Consequently, it submits that the paying agency was correct to take the view that it had to apply a reduction in the direct payments received by the appellants in the main proceedings in the year during which the non-compliance with the cross-compliance rules was found.</p>

            <p>Admittedly, Article 66 of Regulation No 796/2004 provides, in all the language versions available at the date of adoption of that regulation, that a reduction is to be applied on the overall amount of direct payments that has been, or has to be, granted to the farmer following aid applications he has submitted or will still submit in the course of the calendar year of the finding of non-compliance with the cross-compliance rules.</p>

            <p>However, it cannot be deduced from the wording of Article 66, as the Commission points out, that the reduction should be calculated on the amount of direct payments that has been, or will be, received in the calendar year of that finding. In that regard, it must be recalled that an implementing regulation adopted on the basis of an enabling provision in the basic regulation may not derogate from the provisions of that regulation, to which it is subordinate (judgment of 2 March 1999, Spain v Commission, C‑179/97, EU:C:1999:109, paragraph 20). Thus, the wording of Article 66(1) cannot be interpreted as meaning that it calls into question the link between the farmer's behaviour which gave rise to the penalty and that penalty, in derogation from the basic rule laid down in Article 6(1) of Regulation No 1782/2003 that non-compliance with cross-compliance rules leads to a reduction or cancellation of direct payments granted or to be granted in the calendar year in which the non-compliance occurred.</p>

            <p>Indeed, interpreted in the light of Regulation No 1782/2003, Regulation No 796/2004 lays down, in Article 66, detailed rules for the reductions of direct payments for non-compliance with cross-compliance rules, as provided for in Article 7(1) of Regulation No 1782/2003. That Article 66 relates in reality to the methods of reducing direct payments for non-compliance with cross-compliance rules and not to the rules for calculation of such a reduction. By reducing the amounts of direct payments that have been or are to be received by the farmer in the calendar year of the finding of the non-compliance, Article 66 of Regulation No 796/2004 guarantees that recovery of the sum corresponding to that reduction will actually be made, by deduction from the payments due to the farmer. By so doing, that article is such as to ensure both the effectiveness of reductions made for non-compliance with cross-compliance rules and the proper use of payments made under the EU agricultural funds.</p>

            <p>First of all, whether non-compliance with the rules on cross-compliance is found in the same year as it occurs or it is identified during a year after that in which it occurred, the basis for the calculation of the reduction is the same. In both cases, it is based on direct payments in the year in which the non-compliance with cross-compliance rules occurred That solution thus also enables removal of the risk that the amount of payments to which the reduction is applied is significantly higher than that of the year in which the non-compliance with cross-compliance rules occurred or, on the contrary, that the reduction applied is significantly lower in the event of a reduction in the amount of direct payments between the year in which the non-compliance occurred and the year of its finding. It is thus such as to guarantee equal treatment among farmers.</p>

            <p>Next, it must be recalled that the principle of proportionality requires that acts of the EU institutions be appropriate for attaining the legitimate objectives pursued by the legislation at issue and do not exceed the limits of what is necessary in order to achieve those objectives, it being understood that, when there is a choice between several appropriate measures, recourse must be had to the least onerous, and the disadvantages caused must not be disproportionate to the aims pursued (judgment of 14 June 2017, TofuTown.com, C‑422/16, EU:C:2017:458, paragraph 45).</p>

            <p>However, it must be noted that the Commission itself acknowledged in its written observations that, in the circumstances described by the Advocate General in point 96 of his Opinion, the taking into account of the year of a finding of non-compliance with the cross-compliance rules to calculate the reduction or cancellation of direct payments cannot ensure a link between the farmer's behaviour leading to that reduction or cancellation and the reduction or cancellation itself.</p>

            <p>However, observance of the principle of proportionality is still ensured where the reduction or cancellation of the direct payments is calculated on the amount of direct payments granted or to be granted in the calendar year in which the non-compliance with the cross-compliance rules occurred, since such a link is maintained. A reduction or cancellation calculated in that manner is appropriate for ensuring the achievement of the objective of Article 6(1) of Regulation No 1782/2003, which is to penalise instances of non-compliance with the cross-compliance rules, and does not go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective.</p>

            <p>Finally, the principle of legal certainty requires that EU rules enable those concerned to know precisely the extent of the obligations which are imposed on them and that those persons must be able to ascertain unequivocally what their rights and obligations are and take steps accordingly (judgments of 9 March 2017, Doux, C‑141/15, EU:C:2017:188, paragraph 22, and of 20 December 2017, Erzeugerorganisation Tiefkühlgemüse, C‑516/16, EU:C:2017:1011, paragraph 98).</p>

            <p>As pointed out by the applicants in the main proceedings, the taking into account of the year of a finding of non-compliance with the cross-compliance rules to calculate the reduction in direct payments is likely to make it difficult for the farmer concerned to predict the financial consequences he will have to bear because the factual circumstances, such as the number of hectares on the basis of which those payments are granted, can vary greatly from one year to the next and the check under the cross-compliance rules takes place at random times. However, such a risk is not present when the reduction or cancellation of the direct payments is calculated on the basis of the amount of direct payments granted or to be granted in the calendar year in which the non-compliance with the cross-compliance rules occurred, since any change in such factual circumstances subsequent to the occurrence of that non-compliance will have no impact on the financial consequences which he will have to bear.</p>

On the contrary, by referring to `in a given calendar year' or `calendar year' for both the occurrence of non-compliance with the cross-compliance rules and the aid application made by the farmer to whom an act or omission is directly attributable, Article 6(1), as amended, places particular emphasis on the year in which the non-compliance occurred to determine the reduction or cancellation of the direct payments. The indirect reference to Regulation No 796/2004, by the part of the sentence `the total amount of direct payments to be granted... to that farmer shall be reduced or cancelled in accordance with the detailed rules laid down in Article 7', merely refers, as has been found in paragraph 46 of this judgment, to the methods of attributing the reduction or cancellation to direct payment amounts received or receivable in the year in which that non-compliance is found.</p>

            <p>As regards Article 70(4) and (8)(a) of Regulation No 1122/2009, it must be noted, on the one hand, that only Article 70(8)(a) is directly relevant, since it provides that `for the application of reductions, the percentage of the reduction shall be applied to the total amount of ... the overall amount of direct payments that has been, or has to be, granted to the farmer concerned following aid applications he has submitted or will submit in the course of the calendar year of the finding'.</p>

                </tblock>
                <p>60 By its third question, the referring court asks, in essence, which EU rules are applicable in order to calculate the reduction in direct payments where a farmer has not complied with the cross-compliance rules in 2007-2008, but that non-compliance was not found until 2011.</p>

            <p>Firstly, the principle of legal certainty requires that any factual situation should normally, in the absence of any express contrary provision, be examined in the light of the legal rules existing at the time when the situation obtained (judgment of 14 February 2012, Toshiba Corporation and Others, C‑17/10, EU:C:2012:72, paragraph 50 and the case-law cited). However, neither the wording, nor the purpose, nor the general scheme of Article 23(1) of Regulation No 73/2009 contains clear indications that that provision may be applied retroactively.</p>

            <p>Thus, as regards reductions of direct payments due to non-compliance with the cross-compliance rules, it is the EU legislation which was applicable at the date on which the non-compliance in question which must serve to determine the reductions to be applied.</p>

            <p>Secondly, it is clear from a combined reading of Articles 146 and 149 of Regulation No 73/2009 that Regulation No 1782/2003 was repealed with effect from 1 January 2009. In addition, it is apparent from Article 3, second paragraph, (a) of Regulation No 146/2008 that the amendment of Article 6(1) of Regulation No 1782/2003, provided for in Article 1 thereof, applied as from 1 April 2008. Article 6(1) of Regulation No 1782/2003 was therefore applicable in 2007 and until 31 March 2008, Article 6(1) of that regulation, as amended by Regulation No 146/2008, being applicable from 1 April to 31 December 2008.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 6(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) No 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001, Article 6(1) of Regulation No 1782/2003, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 146/2008 of 14 February 2008, and Article 23(1) of Council Regulation (EC) No 73/2009 of 19 January 2009 establishing common rules for direct support schemes for farmers under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers, amending Regulations (EC) No 1290/2005, (EC) No 247/2006 and (EC) No 378/2007 and repealing Regulation No 1782/2003 must be interpreted as meaning that reductions in direct payments due to non-compliance with the cross-compliance rules must be calculated on the basis of payments granted or to be granted in the year during which that non-compliance occurred. Article 66(1) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 796/2004 of 21 April 2004 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of cross-compliance, modulation and the integrated administration and control system provided for in Regulation No 1782/2003 and Article 70(8)(a) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1122/2009 of 30 November 2009 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Regulation No 73/2009 as regards cross-compliance, modulation and the integrated administration and control system, under the direct support schemes for farmers provided for in that Regulation, as well as for the implementation of Council Regulation (EC) No 1234/2007 as regards cross-compliance under the support scheme provided for the wine sector, must be interpreted as meaning that reductions in direct payments thus calculated are to be applied to payments received or to be received in the calendar year during which the non-compliance with the cross-compliance rules is found. 2. The relevant EU rules applicable to the calculation of the reduction in direct payments when a farmer has not complied with the cross-compliance rules in 2007-2008, but that non-compliance was found only during 2011, are Article 6(1) of Regulation No 1782/2003 for 2007 and the first three months of 2008, and Article 6(1) of that regulation, as amended by Regulation No 146/2008, for the period from April to December 2008.</p>
