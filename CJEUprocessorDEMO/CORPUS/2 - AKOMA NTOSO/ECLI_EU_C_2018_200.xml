Such factors have played their part in making the Community coordination rules complex and lengthy. Replacing, while modernising and simplifying, these rules is therefore essential to achieve the aim of the free movement of persons.</p>

Considering that the chances of finding work were generally greater in the Netherlands than in other countries, the Uwv submitted that it made it a principle not to extend the export of unemployment benefits beyond the period of three months, in accordance with the instructions of the Minister van Sociale zaken en Werkgelegenheid (Minister for Social Affairs and Employment, Netherlands). In this context, the Uwv considered that Mr Klein Schiphorst's efforts to find work in Switzerland and the circumstances referred to by him gave no reason to consider that it was unreasonable, in the present case, to abide by such a principle.</p>

The rechtbank Amsterdam considered, taking into account the discretionary nature of the power under Article 64(1)(c) of Regulation No 883/2004, that the Uwv was free to make use of that power in accordance with the rules of national law.</p>

            <p>Against this background, the referring court has doubts as to the compatibility with EU law of the decision of the Uwv, by which it refused to make use, to the benefit of Mr Klein Schiphorst, of the power conferred on the competent services and institutions by the second limb of Article 64(1)(c) of Regulation No 883/2004 to extend the duration of export of unemployment benefits beyond three months.</p>

            <p>In particular, the referring court is uncertain, first, whether the Member States are permitted not to make use of that power in any circumstances. In the event of a negative answer, the referring court considers that it would then be necessary to establish whether, having regard to the objective and scope of Regulation No 883/2004, to the prohibition of imposing a residence requirement or to the free movement of EU citizens and workers, Member States may, in principle, refuse to exercise that power and confine themselves to actually making use of it only in particular circumstances. Lastly, in the case of another negative answer, the referring court wonders how the Member States should make use of that power.</p>

Section A(1) of Annex II to the EC-Switzerland Agreement provides for the application, between the parties, of Regulation No 883/2004. Thus, and since, according to Article 1(2) of that annex, `the term ``Member State(s) '' contained in the legal acts referred to in section A of this Annex shall be understood to include Switzerland in addition to the States covered by the relevant legal acts of the European Union', the provisions of that regulation also cover the Swiss Confederation.</p>

            <p>30 By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 64(1)(c) of Regulation No 883/2004 must be interpreted as precluding a national measure, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which requires the competent institution to refuse, as a matter of principle, any request to extend the unemployment benefit export period beyond three months, provided the institution does not consider that refusing that request would lead to an unreasonable result.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be noted that, according to recitals 4 and 45 of Regulation No 883/2004, the purpose of that regulation is to coordinate Member States' social security systems in order to guarantee that the right to free movement of persons can be exercised effectively. That regulation modernised and simplified the rules contained in Regulation No 1408/71, while retaining the same objective as the latter.</p>

In that regard, the Court has previously ruled, in relation to Article 69 of Regulation No 1408/71, the predecessor provision to Article 64 of Regulation No 883/2004, that the first of those provisions enabled an unemployed worker to be exempt for a specific period, for the purpose of seeking employment in another Member State, from the obligation imposed by the various national laws to make himself available to the employment services of the competent State, without thereby losing his entitlement to unemployment benefits as against that State (judgments of 19 June 1980, Testa and Others, 41/79, 121/79 and 796/79, EU:C:1980:163, paragraph 4 and of 21 February 2002, Rydergård, C‑215/00, EU:C:2002:111, paragraph 17).</p>

            <p>In this respect, as the Netherlands, Danish, Swedish and Norwegian Governments state in their written observations, it is clear from the use of the word `may' that that provision does not require the competent institutions to extend up to a maximum of six months the period during which unemployment benefits, received by a wholly unemployed person who goes to another Member State in order to seek work there, are retained.</p>

            <p>In addition, as all of the intervening parties stated during the hearing, the travaux préparatoires that led to the adoption of that provision highlight, as the Advocate General noted in point 34 of his Opinion, the fact that the Commission's initial proposal to make the six-month export period compulsory failed to win the endorsement of the Council of the European Union, the Member States having, subsequently, eventually agreed on the form of words which makes up the second limb of Article 64(1)(c) of Regulation No 883/2004.</p>

            <p>Regarding the context of which Article 64(1)(c) of Regulation No 883/2004 forms part, it is important to note, first, that unemployment benefits are provided by the competent institution according to the legislation it applies and at its own expense, in accordance with Article 64(1)(d) of that regulation.</p>

            <p>Second, it follows from Article 64(2) of that regulation that, if the person concerned does not return to the competent Member State on or before the expiry of the period during which he is entitled to benefits under Article 64(1)(c) of that regulation, namely three months or, where relevant, if that period is extended by the competent institutions, up to a maximum of six months, he loses all entitlement to benefits under the legislation of the competent Member State, although those institutions may, in exceptional cases, allow the person concerned to return at a later date without losing entitlement.</p>

            <p>As the Advocate General noted in point 55 of his Opinion, that provision allows, inter alia, the competent institutions to extend, in `exceptional circumstances', the period of three months during which the person concerned is entitled to benefits, in order to prevent the loss of all entitlements to benefits, in the event of his late return following the expiry of that period, from giving rise to disproportionate results. Such a possibility confirms that the unemployment benefit export period may be limited to three months, the competent institutions not being required by the second limb of Article 64(1)(c) to extend it up to a maximum of six months.</p>

            <p>That finding is corroborated by the fact that Regulation No 883/2004 does not fix the conditions on which a wholly unemployed person who goes to another Member State in order to seek work there may benefit from an extension of that period beyond three months.</p>

            <p>As regards the aim pursued by Regulation No 883/2004, as was noted in paragraph 31 above, that regulation seeks to coordinate the social security systems in place in the Member States in order to guarantee that free movement can be exercised effectively.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be noted that that regulation does not set up a common scheme of social security, but allows different national social security schemes to exist, and its sole objective is to ensure the coordination of those schemes in order to guarantee that free movement of persons can be exercised effectively. That regulation thus allows different schemes to continue to exist, creating different claims on different institutions against which the claimant possesses direct rights by virtue either of national law alone or of national law supplemented, where necessary, by EU law (see, to that effect, judgments of 19 September 2013, Brey, C‑140/12, EU:C:2013:565, paragraph 43, and of 14 June 2016, Commission v United Kingdom, C‑308/14, EU:C:2016:436, paragraph 67).</p>

            <p>Moreover, it must be noted that, under Regulation No 1408/71 the Court had already ruled that the right to retain unemployment benefits for a period of three months helps to ensure the free movement of workers (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 June 1980, Testa and Others, 41/79, 121/79 and 796/79, EU:C:1980:163, paragraph 14). Such a conclusion applies equally to Regulation No 883/2004 since, in addition to guaranteeing the export of unemployment benefits for a period of three months, it also allows that period to be extended up to a maximum of six months.</p>

            <p>It follows that Article 64(1)(c) of Regulation No 883/2004 guarantees export of unemployment benefits for three months only; however it allows that period to be extended up to a maximum of six months under national law.</p>

            <p>Such an interpretation is not called into question by the principle of waiving of residence clauses as set out in Article 7 of Regulation No 883/2004, to which the national court makes reference by the wording of its question.</p>

            <p>Indeed, it is clear from that article, in particular the words `unless otherwise provided for by [Regulation No 883/2004]', that that regulation contains special provisions derogating from the principle of waiving of residence rules. Such is the case with Article 63 of that regulation, entitled `special provisions for the waiving of residence rules', which provides, with regard to the situation of a wholly unemployed person who satisfies the conditions of the legislation of the competent Member State for entitlement to benefits and who goes to another Member State, that the waiving of residence rules applies only in the cases provided for by Article 64 of that regulation and within the limits prescribed therein.</p>

            <p>As regards the criteria on the basis of which the competent institution may extend the unemployment benefit export period up to a maximum of six months, it must be noted that, when, as in the present case, the Member State concerned has exercised the power provided for in the second limb of Article 64(1)(c) of Regulation No 883/2004, it is for that Member State, failing any criteria laid down in that regulation, to adopt, in accordance with EU law, national measures regulating the competent institution's discretion, in particular by specifying the conditions on which extension of the unemployment benefit export period beyond three months and up to a maximum of six months is or is not to be granted to an unemployed person who goes to another Member State in order to seek work there.</p>

            <p>In the present case it is clear from the documents submitted to the Court, and from the clarifications provided by the Netherlands Government during the hearing, that the Kingdom of the Netherlands initially declined to exercise the power offered by the second limb of Article 64(1)(c) of Regulation No 883/2004, in accordance with a direction issued by the Minister for Social Affairs and Employment in January 2011. However, subsequently, after the Rechtbank Amsterdam (District Court of Amsterdam), by judgment of 2 October 2013 delivered in the main proceedings, considered that reasons had to be given for refusal of a request to extend the export of unemployment benefits beyond three months, the Uwv decided, albeit without departing from the principle that a request of that nature is not to be granted, that in the light of the particular circumstances of the case, in particular the existence of a concrete and demonstrable prospect of employment, the granting of such a request can be justified. In particular, as is clear from the information contained in the order for reference, the Uwv considers that such circumstances are established when the person concerned is involved in a process likely to lead to actual employment and that requires his stay in the host Member State to be extended, or when the person concerned has submitted a declaration of intent from an employer offering him a genuine prospect of employment in that Member State.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules: Article 64(1)(c) of Regulation (EC) No 883/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the coordination of social security systems must be interpreted as not precluding a national measure, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, that requires the competent institution to refuse, as a matter of principle, any request to extend the unemployment benefit export period beyond three months, provided the institution does not consider that refusing that request would lead to an unreasonable result.</p>
