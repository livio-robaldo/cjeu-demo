            <p>On 15 July 2004, the appellants informed the European Commission of the existence of a cartel in the bathroom fixtures and fittings sector and submitted an application for immunity from fines under the Commission notice on immunity from fines and reductions of fines in cartel cases ( OJ 2002 C 45, p. 3) or, in the alternative, for a reduction of any fines that might be imposed on them. On 2 March 2005, the Commission adopted a decision granting the appellants conditional immunity from fines pursuant to points 8(a) and 15 of that notice.</p>

            <p>On 23 June 2010 the Commission adopted the decision at issue, by which it found that there had been an infringement of Article 101(1) TFEU and Article 53 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area of 2 May 1992 ( OJ 1994 L 1, p. 3) in the bathroom fittings and fixtures sector. According to the decision, that infringement, in which 17 undertakings, including the appellants, had participated, took place over various periods between 16 October 1992 and 9 November 2004 and took the form of anticompetitive agreements and concerted practices covering the territory of Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria.</p>

          <content eId="para_15776__content">
            <p>The Commission considered that the anticompetitive practices in question formed part of an overall plan to restrict competition between the undertakings concerned and had the characteristics of a single and continuous infringement which covered bathroom fittings and fixtures belonging to the following three product sub-groups: taps and fittings, shower enclosures and accessories, and ceramic sanitary ware (ceramics) ( `the three product sub-groups').</p>

            <p>On those grounds, the Commission, in Article 2 of the decision at issue, considered the 17 undertakings concerned to have participated in a single infringement and accordingly to have infringed Article 101(1) TFEU and Article 53 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area of 2 May 1992.</p>

            <p>By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 7 September 2010, the appellants brought an action before that Court for annulment of the decision at issue, relying on a single plea in law, which alleged that the Commission had erred in finding that they had participated in a single infringement in the bathroom fittings and fixtures sector.</p>

            <p>By the first part of the first ground of appeal, the appellants complain that the General Court, in finding -- -- in paragraph 59 of the judgment under appeal -- -- that the unlawful practices in question were intended to permit the appellants to present a united front to the wholesalers for the three product sub-groups, including ceramics, manifestly distorted the evidence with respect to their intention to contribute by their own conduct to the common objective pursued by all the participants in the single infringement. They submit that recital 931 of the decision at issue to which the General Court referred to support its reasoning does not permit such a conclusion. Furthermore, contrary to what is stated in paragraph 59 of the judgment under appeal, the appellants did not acknowledge at the hearing before the General Court, in response to questions put by the latter, that the unlawful practices were intended to present a united front to the wholesalers.</p>

            <p>By the second part of the first ground of appeal, the appellants maintain, in the alternative, that, if paragraph 59 of the judgment under appeal is considered not to be intended to show that the appellants sought to contribute by their own conduct to the common objective pursued by all the participants in the single infringement, then the General Court did not examine that issue and, consequently, since it did not apply the relevant legal test, erred in law.</p>

            <p>By the third part of the first ground of appeal, the appellants complain that the General Court distorted the evidence relating to their awareness of the unlawful conduct planned or put into effect by the other undertakings in pursuit of that common objective. They argue in that regard that, in paragraph 61 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court incorrectly inferred from the appellants' membership of umbrella organisations and cross-product associations awareness of all unlawful practices. They submit that they could not have become aware through their membership of such organisations and associations in Belgium, France or Italy of price increase coordination concerning ceramics in those Member States.</p>

According to the case-law of the Court of Justice, that condition also applies in cases where an undertaking is aware of unlawful conduct planned or put into effect by other undertakings in pursuit of that objective and constitutes the element of intent required in order to establish the participation of that undertaking in the anticompetitive conduct in question.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, it should be recalled that, according to settled case-law, an infringement of Article 101(1) TFEU can result not only from an isolated act, but also from a series of acts or from continuous conduct, even if one or more aspects of that series of acts or continuous conduct could also, in themselves and taken in isolation, constitute an infringement of that provision. Accordingly, if the different actions form part of an `overall plan' because their identical object distorts competition in the internal market, the Commission is entitled to impute responsibility for those actions on the basis of participation in the infringement considered as a whole (judgments of 6 December 2012, Commission v Verhuizingen Coppens, C‑441/11 P, EU:C:2012:778, paragraph 41, and of 24 June 2015, Fresh Del Monte Produce v Commission and Commission v Fresh Del Monte Produce, C‑293/13 P and C‑294/13 P, EU:C:2015:416, paragraph 156).</p>

            <p>An undertaking which has participated in a single and complex infringement of that kind by its own conduct, which fell within the definition of an agreement or concerted practice having an anticompetitive object within the meaning of Article 101(1) TFEU and was intended to help bring about the infringement as a whole, may thus be responsible also in respect of the conduct of other undertakings in the context of the same infringement throughout the period of its participation in the infringement. That is the position where it is shown that the undertaking intended, through its own conduct, to contribute to the common objectives pursued by all the participants and that it was aware of the offending conduct planned or put into effect by other undertakings in pursuit of the same objectives or that it could reasonably have foreseen it and was prepared to take the risk (judgments of 6 December 2012, Commission v Verhuizingen Coppens, C‑441/11 P, EU:C:2012:778, paragraph 42, and of 24 June 2015, Fresh Del Monte Produce v Commission and Commission v Fresh Del Monte Produce, C‑293/13 P and C‑294/13 P, EU:C:2015:416, paragraph 157).</p>

            <p>It should be noted in this regard that, as is clear from that paragraph, the General Court took that finding into account in any event only for the sake of completeness in establishing the existence and nature of an overall plan showing there to be a single infringement. Indeed, that finding as to an overall plan followed, according to the General Court, from many other factors identified by the Commission in the decision at issue.</p>

            <p>In the present case, it can be seen from an examination of the application initiating proceedings and the reply lodged at the Registry of the General Court -- -- in particular of the passages of those documents on which the appellants rely in support of the present appeal -- -- that, although the appellants denied being aware of the overall collusion concerning the three product sub-groups, they did not raise before the General Court any argument to the effect that they did not contribute by their conduct to the common objectives pursued by all the participants, owing to the fact that they could not reasonably have foreseen the offending conduct complained of and that they were not prepared to take the risk associated with that conduct.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances the General Court cannot be criticised for not expressly examining those issues in the judgment under appeal. Concerning the argument that the General Court did not consider whether the appellants could reasonably have foreseen all the unlawful conduct complained of and whether they were prepared to take the risk, it should also be stated that, since the General Court, in paragraphs 61 and 82 of the judgment under appeal, held that the appellants had been aware of that conduct, it was not required to determine whether they could reasonably have foreseen that conduct and had taken the risk, as the two conditions are, as is clear from paragraph 23 of the present judgment, alternative.</p>

            <p>As is clear from settled case-law, the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice in appeal proceedings is, as a general rule, confined to a review of the findings of law on the pleas argued at first instance (see, to that effect, judgments of 30 April 2014, FLSmidth v Commission, C‑238/12 P, EU:C:2014:284, paragraph 42, and of 22 May 2014, ASPLA v Commission, C‑35/12 P, EU:C:2014:348, paragraph 39).</p>

            <p>In the third part of their first ground of appeal, the appellants claim that the General Court distorted the evidence inasmuch as it erred in holding, in paragraphs 61 and 82 of the judgment under appeal, that they had been aware of all the unlawful practices, including those relating to ceramics, in Belgium, France and Italy.</p>

            <p>In that connection, it should be borne in mind that, in accordance with Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal lies on points of law only. The General Court thus has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence. The appraisal of the facts and the assessment of the evidence thus do not, save where the facts and evidence have been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (see, to that effect, order of 24 September 2009,Alcon v OHIM , C‑481/08 P, not published, EU:C:2009:579, paragraph 18; judgment of 13 January 2011, Media-Saturn-Holding v OHIM , C‑92/10 P, not published, EU:C:2011:15, paragraph 27; and order of 3 March 2016, AgriCapital v OHIM , C‑440/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:144, paragraph 32).</p>

            <p>According to settled case-law law of the Court of Justice, there is such distortion where, without recourse to new evidence, the assessment of the existing evidence is manifestly incorrect. However, such distortion must be obvious from the documents in the case, without it being necessary to undertake a fresh assessment of the facts and the evidence. Moreover, where an appellant alleges distortion of the evidence by the General Court, he must indicate precisely the evidence alleged to have been distorted by that Court and show the errors of appraisal which, in his view, led to that distortion (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 December 2015, Italy v Commission , C‑280/14 P, EU:C:2015:792, paragraph 52 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It must be stated that, as regards the findings in paragraphs 61 and 82 of the judgment under appeal relating to the appellants' awareness of the unlawful practices in question, the appellants have not, in their appeal, identified any evidence the assessment of which by the General Court is manifestly incorrect, for the purposes of that case-law.</p>

            <p>Thus, the appellants, whilst purporting to advance arguments concerning an alleged distortion of the evidence, are in reality seeking to challenge the General Court's appraisal of the facts, according to which the Commission could -- -- in particular in view of the practices for coordinating price increases within the umbrella associations of which the appellants were members -- -- properly consider that the appellants had been aware of all the unlawful practices concerned, including those concerning ceramics. Such an appraisal is not subject to review by the Court in an appeal.</p>
