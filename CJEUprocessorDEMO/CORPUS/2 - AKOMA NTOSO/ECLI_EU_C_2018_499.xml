            <p>On 25 March 2016, Mr Diallo brought an administrative appeal on a point of law against that judgment before the Conseil d'État (Council of State, Belgium). In support of his appeal, Mr Diallo submits, in particular, that under Article 10(1) of Directive 2004/38 the decision on the application for a residence card must be notified to the applicant within a period of six months following the submission of the application, and that national law must be interpreted in such a way as to meet that requirement. He also takes the view that granting the competent national authority a further period of six months, following the annulment of an initial decision, renders Article 10(1) of Directive 2004/38 redundant.</p>

            <p>The Belgian State contends, in particular, that no statutory or regulatory provision lays down a period of notification of a decision on an application for a residence card. It argues that the competent national authority is required only to adopt such a decision within a period of six months. Furthermore, it submits that, inasmuch as Directive 2004/38 does not regulate the effects arising from the annulment judgment of 29 September 2015, namely the period within which a new decision must be taken by the competent national authority following the judicial annulment of an initial decision, that question is a matter of national law. In any case, the Belgian State takes the view that it has not been demonstrated that opening a new six-month period in which to decide on an application for a residence card following a judicial annulment is unreasonable.</p>

            <p>It is in that context that the referring court notes, first of all, that national law provides only that the right of residence is to be granted no later than six months from the date of the application, without specifying whether the decision on the grant of the right of residence must be notified to the person concerned within that period. That court considers that, in order to apply national law in accordance with the requirements of Article 10(1) of Directive 2004/38, it must be determined whether that provision must be interpreted as meaning that the decision as to whether to recognise a right of residence must be taken and notified within the period of six months.</p>

            <p>Next, the referring court states that Directive 2004/38 does not regulate the consequences of the annulment of a decision concerning an application for a residence card. More specifically, it entertains doubts as to the time period available to the competent national authority to decide on an application for a residence card following the judicial annulment of its initial decision refusing to grant the right at issue. In that regard, the court considers that, in order to determine that new time period, it must be ascertained whether the principle of effectiveness precludes the competent national authority being allowed the full six-month period provided for in Article 10(1) of Directive 2004/38, following the annulment of its decision.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the referring court notes that, according to national case-law, taking into account the mandatory nature of the time period referred to in Article 10(1) of Directive 2004/38 and the effects of an annulment judgment, the competent national authority is allowed, as from the notification of that judgment, the full period which it had to decide on an application for a residence card and not only the remainder of the period yet to run as at the date on which the annulled measure was adopted.</p>

            <p>Lastly, the referring court seeks clarification as to whether Directive 2004/38 precludes a residence card being issued automatically to the applicant on account of the period of six months, laid down in Article 10(1) of that Directive, being exceeded, even where the applicant does not quality for it. In that regard, the referring court explains that, if it were apparent that the time period referred to in Article 10(1) of Directive 2004/38 had actually been exceeded in the case in the main proceedings, and that the directive did not preclude the residence card sought being issued as a consequence of exceeding that period, the decision of 9 November 2015, refusing to grant the residence card to Mr Diallo, should then be considered unlawful.</p>

            <p>According to settled case-law of the Court, not all third-country nationals derive rights of entry into and residence in a Member State from Directive 2004/38, but only those who are a `family member', within the meaning of Article 2(2) of that directive, of a Union citizen who has exercised his right of freedom of movement by becoming established in a Member State other than the Member State of which he is a national (judgment of 8 November 2012, Iida, C‑40/11, EU:C:2012:691, paragraph 51).</p>

            <p>Secondly, it is apparent from the file submitted to the Court, together with the statements made by the Belgian Government at the hearing, that the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings provides for a system of automatically issuing residence cards of family members of a Union citizen under which the competent national authority must automatically issue such cards to applicants when the period of six months, referred to in Article 10(1) of Directive 2004/38, is exceeded.</p>

            <p>Taking into account all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the fifth question is that Directive 2004/38 must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which requires competent national authorities to issue automatically a residence card of a family member of a European Union citizen to the person concerned, where the period of six months, referred to in Article 10(1) of Directive 2004/38, is exceeded, without finding, beforehand, that the person concerned actually meets the conditions for residing in the host Member State in accordance with EU law.</p>

            </tblock>
            <p>57 By its third and fourth questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court is asking, in essence, whether EU law must be interpreted as precluding national case-law, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, under which, following the judicial annulment of a decision refusing to issue a residence card of a family member of a Union citizen, the competent national authority is automatically allowed the full period of six months provided for in Article 10(1) of Directive 2004/38.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be noted that Directive 2004/38 does not contain any provisions concerning the effects of the judicial annulment of decisions adopted by competent national authorities refusing to issue a residence card of a family member of a Union citizen, and in particular the issue of what time period those authorities have for the purposes of adopting a new decision following such an annulment.</p>

            <p>Thus, according to the Court's settled case-law, in the absence of EU rules on the matter, it is for the national legal order of each Member State to establish them in accordance with the principle of procedural autonomy, on condition, however, that those rules are not less favourable than those governing similar domestic situations (principle of equivalence) and that they do not make it excessively difficult or impossible in practice to exercise the rights conferred by EU law (principle of effectiveness) (see, to that effect, judgments of 17 March 2016, Bensada Benallal, C‑161/15, EU:C:2016:175, paragraph 24, and of 13 December 2017, El Hassani, C‑403/16, EU:C:2017:960, paragraph 26).</p>

            <p>The referring court cites national case-law pursuant to which the judicial annulment of a decision taken by an administrative authority within a mandatory time period automatically opens the way, from the notification of the annulment judgment, to the full period of six months in which that authority has to decide. Thus, pursuant to that case-law, the competent national authority had, following the judicial annulment of its initial decision, a new period of six months on the basis of Article 10(1) of Directive 2004/38 in which to respond to Mr Diallo's application for a residence card of a family member of a Union citizen.</p>

            <p>Against that background, the automatic opening of a new period of six months following the judicial annulment of the competent national authority's initial decision appears to be of such a nature as to render excessively difficult the exercise of the right of the family member of a Union citizen to obtain a decision on his application for a residence card on the basis of Article 10(1) of Directive 2004/38.</p>

            <p>In the first place, as recalled in paragraph 40 of the present judgment, the administrative procedure instituted in Article 10(1) of Directive 2004/38 is intended to verify the individual situation of third-country nationals in the light of the provisions of EU law within a mandatory time period of six months. In particular, national competent authorities must only verify, within that period, whether the third-country national is in a position to prove, through the submission of the documents stated in Article 10(2) of that directive, that he comes within the scope of the concept of `family member' of a Union citizen, within the meaning of Directive 2004/38, in order to benefit from the residence card.</p>

          <content eId="para_14883__content">
            <p>In the second place, it is apparent from the settled case-law of the Court that the purpose of Directive 2004/38 is to facilitate the exercise of the primary and individual right to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States which is conferred directly on citizens of the Union by Article 21(1) TFEU. Recital 5 of the directive states that that right should, if it is to be exercised under objective conditions of dignity, be also granted to the family members of those citizens, irrespective of nationality (judgment of 14 November 2017Lounes, C‑165/16, EU:C:2017:862, paragraph 31 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>That purpose requires that a third-country national who submits proof that he comes within the scope of the concept of `family member' of a Union citizen, within the meaning of Directive 2004/38, be issued with a residence card certifying that status at the earliest opportunity.</p>

          <content eId="para_14885__content">
            <p>First, as noted in essence by the European Commission, the declaratory nature of the residence card allows the third-country national, who remains in a situation of legal uncertainty concerning the legitimacy of his residence, to certify, in so far as the material conditions required for the purposes of obtaining his right of residence are met, the existence of his derivative right of residence, facilitating both the exercise of that right and his integration in the host Member State.</p>

            <p>Secondly, it should be noted that, in accordance with Article 5(2) of Directive 2004/38, only the possession of a valid residence card is to exempt the family members of a Union citizen, who are not nationals of a Member State, from the obligation to obtain a visa to enter the territory of the Member States. As is apparent from recital 8 of that directive, that exemption aims to facilitate the free movement of third-country nationals who are family members of a Union citizen (judgment of 18 December 2014, McCarthy and Others, C‑202/13, EU:C:2014:2450, paragraphs 40 and 41).</p>

            <p>Consequently, the automatic opening of a new period of six months, following the judicial annulment of a decision refusing to issue a residence card, appears disproportionate in the light of the ultimate purpose of the administrative procedure referred to in Article 10(1) of Directive 2004/38 and the objectives of that directive.</p>

            <p>It follows that the principle of effectiveness and the objective of rapid processing of applications inherent to Directive 2004/38 preclude national authorities automatically being allowed a new period of six months following the judicial annulment of an initial decision refusing to issue a residence card. They are required to adopt a new decision within a reasonable period of time, which cannot, in any case, exceed the period referred to in Article 10(1) of Directive 2004/38.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties in the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court.

Article 10(1) of Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States amending Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 and repealing Directives 64/221/EEC, 68/360/EEC, 72/194/EEC, 73/148/EEC, 75/34/EEC, 75/35/EEC, 90/364/EEC, 90/365/EEC and 93/96/EEC, must be interpreted as meaning that the decision on the application for a residence card of a family member of a Union citizen must be adopted and notified within the period of six months laid down in that provision. 2. Directive 2004/38 must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which requires competent national authorities to issue automatically a residence card of a family member of a European Union citizen to the person concerned, where the period of six months, referred to in Article 10(1) of Directive 2004/38, is exceeded, without finding, beforehand, that the person concerned actually meets the conditions for residing in the host Member State in accordance with EU law. 3. EU law must be interpreted as precluding national case-law, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, under which, following the judicial annulment of a decision refusing to issue a residence card of a family member of a Union citizen, the competent national authority automatically regains the full period of six months referred to in Article 10(1) of Directive 2004/38.</p>
