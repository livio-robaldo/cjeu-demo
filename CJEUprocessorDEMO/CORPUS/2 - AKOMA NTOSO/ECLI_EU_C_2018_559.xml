            <p>The referring court points out that the Tribunal Supremo (Supreme Court, Spain) held, in a judgment delivered on 7 April 2016, that Article 14 of the collective agreement for security firms concerns the succession in time of two undertakings providing a private security service. That succession includes an obligation for the transferee to take on the employees of the former undertaking.</p>

            <p>Thus, according to that judgment, when one contractor succeeds another, subrogation does not operate pursuant to Article 44 of the Workers' Statute if there has been no transfer of financial assets or transfer of employees in sectors where the activity is essentially labour-based. Therefore, in such cases, subrogation is effected in accordance with the applicable collective agreement. Consequently, the taking-on of the former undertaking's employees does not reflect the situation in which members of staff are transferred because the new contracting company voluntarily takes on the majority of the employees who provided the services in question. On the contrary, in those cases, the transfer of staff is the result of compliance with the provisions laid down in the applicable collective agreement. The new contracting company could have assigned its own staff to the services concerned but is, however, required by that collective agreement to take on the employees assigned to those services by the former contracting company.</p>

            <p>The Tribunal Supremo (Supreme Court) took the view that the case-law of the Court of Justice laid down in the judgment of 24 January 2002, Temco ( C‑51/00, EU:C:2002:48) does not preclude that conclusion given that the subrogation imposed by the collective agreement for security firms does not arise from a situation which comes within the scope of Directive 2001/23 or of Article 44 of the Workers' Statute. The relationship between Article 44 of the Workers' Statute and Article 14 of the collective agreement for security firms is one of supplementation or of peaceful coexistence, in that the rules of the collective agreement, governing a different situation, improves the situation by applying one of the effects laid down in the statutory provision for its own scope of application.</p>

            <p>The referring court is thus uncertain, in essence, whether, in the context of an activity that is essentially labour-based, the subrogation between undertakings, arising as the result of a transfer of a contract for the provision of services in accordance with a collective agreement which provides that the transferee undertaking is obliged to take on the staff of the undertaking which formerly held the contract, comes within the scope of Directive 2001/23. If that is the case, it is unsure whether a provision of the applicable collective agreement excluding the joint and several liability of the transferor and transferee as regards the compliance with the contractual obligations arising from employment contracts prior to the date of transfer of the service in question complies with Article 3(1) of that directive.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the Tribunal Superior de Justicia de Galicia (High Court of Justice of Galicia) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling: `</p>
            <blockList>
              <item>
                <num>(1)</num>
                <p>Does Article 1(1) of Council Directive 2001/23 ... apply when an undertaking ceases to hold the contract for the service it is engaged to provide for a client as a result of termination of the contract for the provision of the service, in a labour-intensive business (security of buildings), and the new holder of the contract for the service takes on the majority of the employees assigned to the performance of that service, when those employment contracts are taken over in accordance with the terms of the collective agreement [for security firms]?</p>
              </item>
              <item>
                <num>(2)</num>
                <p>If the answer to the first question should be in the affirmative, if the legislation adopted by the Member State in order to transpose Directive 2001/23 provides, in accordance with Article 3(1) of that directive, that, after the date of the transfer, the transferor and the transferee are to be jointly and severally liable for obligations, including those relating to wages, which arose before the date of the transfer as a result of employment contracts existing on the date of the transfer, is an interpretation to the effect that joint and several liability for prior obligations does not apply when the majority of the workforce were taken on by the new contractor as a result of the requirements of the collective agreement [for security firms] and the wording of that agreement excludes joint and several liability for obligations preceding the transfer, compatible with Article 3(1) of that directive?'</p>

                  <p>The first question</p>
                </tblock>
                <p>24 By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 1(1) of Directive 2001/23 must be interpreted as meaning that that directive applies to a situation in which a contracting entity has terminated the contract for the provision of services relating to the security of buildings concluded with one undertaking and has, for the purposes of the provision of those services, concluded a new contract with another undertaking, which takes on, pursuant to a collective agreement, the majority, in terms of their number and skills, of the staff whom the first undertaking had assigned to the performance of those services, when the activity concerned is essentially labour-based.</p>

            <p>Article 1(1)(a) of Directive 2001/23 applies to any transfer of an undertaking, business or part of an undertaking or business to another employer as a result of a legal transfer or merger.</p>

            <p>In that respect, according to well-established case-law, the scope of that provision cannot be determined solely on the basis of a textual interpretation. On account of the differences between the language versions of that directive and the divergences between the laws of the Member States with regard to the concept of legal transfer, the Court has given that concept a sufficiently flexible interpretation in keeping with the objective of that directive, which is, as stated in recital 3 thereof, to provide for the protection of employees in the event of a change of employer (judgment of 20 January 2011, CLECE, C‑463/09, EU:C:2011:24, paragraph 29 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In accordance with settled case-law of the Court, Directive 2001/23 is applicable whenever, in the context of contractual relations, there is a change in the natural or legal person responsible for carrying on the undertaking and entering into the obligations of an employer towards employees of the undertaking. There is thus no need, in order for Directive 2001/23 to be applicable, for there to be any direct contractual relationship between the transferor and the transferee, since the transfer may take place through the intermediary of a third party (judgment of 19 October 2017, Securitas, C‑200/16, EU:C:2017:780, paragraph 23 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It follows that the lack of a contractual link between the two undertakings successively entrusted with managing the surveillance of the buildings in question has no bearing on the question as to whether or not Directive 2001/23 is applicable to a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 October 2017, Securitas, C‑200/16, EU:C:2017:780, paragraph 24).</p>

            <p>It must also be noted that, in accordance with Article 1(1)(b) of Directive 2001/23, in order for that directive to be applicable, the transfer must concern `an economic entity which retains its identity, meaning an organised grouping of resources which has the objective of pursuing an economic activity, whether that activity is central or ancillary'.</p>

            <p>In order to determine whether that condition is in fact met, it is necessary to consider all the facts characterising the transaction in question, including in particular the type of undertaking or business, whether or not its tangible assets, such as buildings and movable property, are transferred, the value of its intangible assets at the time of the transfer, whether or not the majority of its employees are taken over by the new employer, whether or not its customers are transferred, the degree of similarity between the activities carried on before and after the transfer, and the period, if any, for which those activities were suspended. Those circumstances must be considered as part of the overall assessment of the circumstances of the particular case and cannot therefore be examined in isolation (judgment of 19 October 2017, Securitas, C‑200/16, EU:C:2017:780, paragraph 26 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In particular, the Court has held that a national court, in assessing the facts characterising the transaction in question, must take into account, among other things, the type of undertaking or business concerned (judgments of 26 November 2015, Aira Pascual and Algeposa Terminales Ferroviarios, C‑509/14, EU:C:2015:781, paragraph 33, and of 19 October 2017, Securitas, C‑200/16, EU:C:2017:780, paragraph 27).</p>

          <content eId="para_16422__content">
            <p>It follows that the degree of importance to be attached to each criterion for determining whether or not there has been a transfer within the meaning of Directive 2001/23 will necessarily vary according to the activity carried on, or indeed according to the production or operating methods employed in the relevant undertaking, business or part of a business (judgment of 19 October 2017, Securitas, C‑200/16, EU:C:2017:780, paragraph 28 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_16423__content">
            <p>The Court has previously stated that an economic entity is able, in certain sectors, to function without any significant tangible or intangible assets, and therefore the maintenance of the identity of such an entity following the transaction affecting it cannot, logically, depend on the transfer of such assets (judgment of 20 January 2011, CLECE, C‑463/09, EU:C:2011:24, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <num>34</num>
          <content eId="para_16424__content">
            <p>The Court has thus held that, inasmuch as, in certain labour-intensive sectors, a group of workers engaged in a joint activity on a permanent basis may constitute an economic entity, such an entity is capable of maintaining its identity after it has been transferred where the new employer does not merely pursue the activity in question but also takes over a major part, in terms of their numbers and skills, of the employees specially assigned by his predecessor to that task. In those circumstances, the new employer takes over an organised body of assets enabling him to carry on the activities or certain activities of the transferor undertaking on a regular basis (judgment of 20 January 2011, CLECE, C‑463/09, EU:C:2011:24, paragraph 36 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_16425__content">
            <p>Thus, a business providing security in a museum, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which does not require specific tangible assets, can be regarded as essentially a labour-intensive activity and, consequently, a group of workers engaged in a joint security activity on a permanent basis may, in the absence of other factors of production, constitute an economic entity. The identity of that entity must nonetheless be retained after the transfer in question (see, by analogy, judgment of 20 January 2011, CLECE, C‑463/09, EU:C:2011:24, paragraph 39).</p>

            <p>In that respect, it is apparent from the order for reference that VINSA, for the purposes of carrying out the activities of providing security for the Museo de las Peregrinaciones in Santiago de Compostela, formerly entrusted to Esabe Vigilancia, took on the workers whom the latter had previously assigned to those activities.</p>

          <content eId="para_16427__content">
            <p>It follows that the identity of an economic entity, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which is essentially labour-intensive, can be retained if the majority of its employees are taken on by the presumed transferee.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, although the Spanish Government submits in its written observations that the engagement of the staff of Esabe Vigilancia was imposed on VINSA by a collective agreement, that circumstance, in any event, has no bearing on the fact that the transfer concerns an economic entity. It must, moreover, be emphasised that the objective pursued by the collective agreement for security firms is the same as that pursued by Directive 2001/23 and that that collective agreement is expressly intended, as regards the engagement of part of the staff, to cover the case of a new tendering procedure such as that at issue in the main proceedings (see, to that effect, judgment of 24 January 2002, Temco, C‑51/00, EU:C:2002:48, paragraph 27).</p>

          <content eId="para_16429__content">
            <p>Consequently, the answer to the first question is that Article 1(1) of Directive 2001/23 must be interpreted as meaning that that directive applies to a situation in which a contracting entity has terminated the contract for the provision of services relating to the security of buildings concluded with one undertaking and has, for the purposes of the provision of those services, concluded a new contract with another undertaking, which takes on, pursuant to a collective agreement, the majority, in terms of their number and skills, of the staff whom the first undertaking had assigned to the performance of those services, in so far as the operation is accompanied by the transfer of an economic entity between the two undertakings concerned.</p>
            <tblock>
              <p>The second question</p>
            </tblock>
            <p>40 By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the second subparagraph of Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/23 must be interpreted as precluding, under a collective agreement, the transferor and the transferee of the economic entity concerned from being exempt from the obligation to assume joint and several liability for obligations, including those relating to wages, which arose from employment contracts before that entity was transferred.</p>

          <content eId="para_16430__content">
            <p>The first subparagraph of Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/23 lays down the principle that the transferor's rights and obligations arising from a contract of employment or from an employment relationship existing on the date of a transfer are to be transferred to the transferee. The second subparagraph of Article 3(1) states that Member States may provide that, after the date of transfer, the transferor and the transferee are to be jointly and severally liable in respect of obligations which arose before the date of transfer from a contract of employment or an employment relationship existing on the date of the transfer.</p>

          <content eId="para_16431__content">
            <p>In that respect, it is apparent from the order for reference that Article 44(3) of the Workers' Statute provides that, in the case of inter vivos transfers, the transferor and the transferee are to be jointly and severally liable for three years for obligations arising from an employment contract before the transfer and which have not been fulfilled. The collective agreement for security firms does not provide for any such joint and several liability.</p>

            <p>In its written observations, the Spanish Government submits that the second question falls outside of the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice. The question as formulated by the national court, it argues, requires the Court of Justice not to carry out an interpretation of the second subparagraph of Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/23, but to give a ruling on whether certain national provisions are compatible with each other. The Court of Justice does not, however, have jurisdiction to rule on the compatibility of such provisions.</p>

            <p>In that respect, it should be recalled that, according to settled case-law, the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice is confined to considering provisions of EU law alone. It is for the national court to assess the scope of national provisions and the manner in which they must be applied (order of 23 May 2011, Rossius and Collard, C‑267/10 and C‑268/10, not published, EU:C:2011:332, paragraph 15).</p>

            <p>In this case, in the light of the wording of that question, it must be held that, in reality, the question concerns the examination of the consistency of a provision of a collective agreement with a provision of national law.

Article 1(1) of Council Directive 2001/23/EC of 12 March 2001 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the safeguarding of employees' rights in the event of transfers of undertakings, businesses or parts of undertakings or businesses, must be interpreted as meaning that that directive applies to a situation in which a contracting entity has terminated the contract for the provision of services relating to the security of buildings concluded with one undertaking and has, for the purposes of the provision of those services, concluded a new contract with another undertaking, which takes on, pursuant to a collective agreement, the majority, in terms of their number and skills, of the staff whom the first undertaking had assigned to the performance of those services, in so far as the operation is accompanied by the transfer of an economic entity between the two undertakings concerned. 2.
