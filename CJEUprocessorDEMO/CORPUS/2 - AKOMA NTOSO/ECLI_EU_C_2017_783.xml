            <p>Towards the end of 2010, Vion exported 36 live bovine animals to Lebanon. Those animals were first transported by truck from Woerden (Netherlands) to Koper (Slovenia), from where they were loaded onto a vessel adapted for transporting livestock. The animals then left EU territory, by sea, arriving in Beirut (Lebanon).</p>

            <p>In accordance with Regulation No 1/2005, Vion had submitted to the competent Netherlands authority, prior to the journey, a journey log specifying -- pursuant to Section 1 thereof, entitled `Planning' -- that the total journey time was to be seven days, that the place of departure was Woerden and that the place of destination was Beirut. That transport was to commence on9 September 2010, with no departure time being stipulated, and to be completed on 16 September 2010. Last, it was indicated that the animals would rest in Munich (Germany) and be loaded onto the vessel at Koper.</p>

The `declaration by the transporter', contained in Section 4 of that journey log, showed that the animals arrived in Koper at 10:50 a.m. on 10 September 2010 and that that time and date corresponded to the time and date of arrival at the place of destination. That journey log, however, contains no information relating to the conduct of the transport between the departure of the vessel from Koper and arrival at Beirut.</p>

The State Secretary criticised Vion's transporter for having filled in Section 4 of the journey log until only the point of exit from EU territory and not until the animals' final destination. Thus, according to that transporter's declaration, the journey was supposed to end in Koper and not to continue on until Beirut.</p>

            <p>In the light of the wording of points 3 and 7 of Annex II to Regulation No 1/2005, the referring court, like Vion, doubts whether the organiser or transporter could keep the journey log until the final point of destination of the journey, namely until the third country concerned. The referring court is convinced, however, that it is only on the basis of the journey log that the veterinarian of the place of the first unloading in the third country of final destination could actually ensure that Regulation No 1/2005 has been complied with.</p>

            <p>The referring court notes, however, that the position advanced by the State Secretary is based also on solid arguments.

In order to be effective, such checks would presuppose that the journey log was held until arrival in that third country. According to the referring court, any other solution would have the effect of preventing the part of the transport that took place within the territory of the third country from being checked by means of the journey log.</p>

It must therefore be recovered, as must any penalty imposed on the exporter or the transporter.

            <p>Second, Regulation No 817/2010 requires, in accordance with Recital 3 thereof, in order to guarantee that the animal welfare standards are maintained, a monitoring system comprising compulsory checks not only at the exit point from the customs territory of the Union, but also up to the place of the first unloading in the third country of final destination. In accordance with, inter alia, Article 3(1)(b) of that regulation, checks must be carried out at the place of the first unloading in the third country of final destination, which checks must, pursuant to the second subparagraph of Article 3(2) of that regulation, lead to the preparation of a report, based on the model referred to in paragraph 17 of the present judgment. As that model confirms, the objective of those checks is essentially to establish whether the provisions of Regulation No 1/2005 have been complied with, including during the part of the journey between the exit point of the Union and the place of the first unloading in the third country of final destination.</p>
