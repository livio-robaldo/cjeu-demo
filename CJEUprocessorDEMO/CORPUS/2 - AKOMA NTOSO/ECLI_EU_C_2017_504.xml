The use of these markings or marks should not place any obstacle in the way of intra-Community trade.

In the period referred to in the preceding paragraph, the release for consumption of cigarettes each month by each economic operator must not exceed the quantitative limits, deriving from the application of a multiplying factor of 10% to the average monthly quantity of cigarettes released for consumption in the 12 months immediately preceding. 3.   For the purposes of the preceding paragraph, the calculation of the monthly average shall be based on the total quantity of releases for consumption of cigarettes, non-exempt, between 1 September of the previous year and 31 August of the following year. 4.   Each economic operator shall provide to the competent customs office, by 15 September of each year at the latest, an initial declaration indicating its monthly average and setting out the quantitative limit applicable in its case in the limitation period. 5.   In exceptional circumstances, duly justified by the sudden change for a limited time of the volume of sales, the failure to comply with those quantitative limits may be authorised, although they shall not be taken into account for the purpose of calculating the average month for the following year. 6.   After the expiry of the limitation period and at the latest at the end of the month of January of each year, economic operators shall provide the competent customs office with a declaration of discharge indicating the total quantity of cigarettes actually released for consumption in the limitation period. 7.   The amount of cigarettes exceeding the quantitative limit referred to in paragraph 4 are subject to the payment of tax at the rate applicable on the date on which the declaration of discharge is lodged, where it is established that the quantitative limit has been exceeded by the comparison of the information in that document and that processed by the administration without prejudice, where applicable, to the infringement procedure which is required. 8.   The rules laid down in this Article are individually applicable on Mainland Portugal, the Autonomous Region of the Azores and the Autonomous Region of Madeira, since the obligations laid down in the preceding paragraph must be fulfilled at the customs office where the release for consumption is dealt with.'</p>

            <p>By its first plea in law, the Commission claims that once tobacco products are placed on the market the tax legislation of the European Union does not authorise Member States to subject those products, taking account of the date of release for consumption, to an excise duty in addition to the tax levied or to limit their distribution for tax reasons. In Portugal, under Article 27(a) of Decree No 1295/2007, the packets of cigarettes bearing a particular excise marking may only be sold and marketed until the end of the third month of the year following that during which they were released for consumption ( `the contested measure').</p>

            <p>According to the Commission, in order for the contested provision to be justified by the objective of combating tax evasion and tax avoidance, the increase in excise duty on cigarettes should be quite substantial. The excise duty on cigarettes has not been significantly increased in recent years in Portugal. According to the data concerning cigarettes in the most popular price category (MPPC), the price for 1000 cigarettes increased from EUR 170 in 2009 to EUR 195 in 2014, which represents an increase of 14.7% in a five-year period, that is an increase of EUR 3.4 to 3.9 per packet of 20 cigarettes.</p>

In that regard, the Commission refers to Article 14 of Directive 2001/37/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 June 2001 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning the manufacture, presentation and sale of tobacco products ( OJ 2001 L 194, p. 26), which provides that tobacco products other than cigarettes which do not comply with the provisions of that directive may continue to be marketed for two years after the date of entry into force of that directive, against one year for cigarettes. It states that those periods have been fixed in order to take account of seasonal variations in the turnover of those products.</p>

            </p>
            <p>explains that the Portuguese tax marking system is based principally on the fact that the background colour of the marking is changed each year. It is essentially that characteristic which stabilises that system and enables it to achieve the objectives mentioned. Thus, according to the Portuguese legislation, a tobacco product released for consumption in 2015 had to bear the marking corresponding to that year and, in principle, could be marketed until 31 December 2015, since from 1 January 2016 a new tax marking with a different background colour was applicable. Articles 27 and 28 of Decree No 1295/2007 provide for an exception to that principle by authorising the marketing and retail sale of tobacco products after the end of the year corresponding to the marking affixed. Thus, in practice the annual tax marking is valid for 15 months.</p>

            <p>states that the quantitative limits provided for in Article 106 CIEC are not sufficient on their own to achieve that objective. If only those limits existed, it would be easy for operators with substantial economic power to release massive amounts of packets of cigarettes for consumption before the beginning of the limitation period, for example in July and August and to use products in stock in order to supply the market in the following year.</p>

            </p>
            <p>contends that if at the end of March of each year there are tobacco products in stock, that is not due to the fact that the time limit laid down by Article 27(a) of Decree No 1295/2007 is excessively short, as the Commission wrongly submits, but to the fact that before the beginning of the limitation period operators have made excessive releases of products for consumption, with the aim of building up sufficient stocks in order to continue the following year and during the maximum period authorised to market the products bearing the previous year's marking.</p>

            <p>disputes the allegations made in that regard by the Commission. As excise duties, which represent 78.08% of the price of cigarettes, are reimbursed if cigarettes not sold within the time limit laid down by Article 27(a) of Decree No 1295/2007 are destroyed, the costs of the destruction are not very high with regard to the cost of the products leaving the factory.</p>

            <p>First, it must be recalled that, under Article 7 of Directive 2008/118, excise duty becomes chargeable at the time, and in the Member State, of release for consumption The first paragraph of Article 9 further provides that the chargeability conditions and rate of excise duty to be applied are to be those in force on the date on which duty becomes chargeable in the Member State of release for consumption.</p>

            <p>Nor can the Commission legitimately argue that the effect of Article 27 of Decree No 1295/2007 is to force economic operators to pay a supplementary excise duty on packets of cigarettes which have already been lawfully released for consumption. It is clear from the documents before the Court that, if on expiry of the period prescribed in Article 27, those operators have packets of cigarettes which they have not been able to sell, they may either request the reimbursement of previously paid excise duties or re-release the products concerned for consumption by affixing a new tax marking under customs supervision, that operation being the chargeable event giving rise to the tax.</p>

            <p>It is common ground that the contested measure is a measure intended to prevent the release for consumption in excessive quantities of packets of cigarettes at the end of the year in anticipation of an increase in excise duty.

            <p>It must be recalled that the Member States must employ means which, whilst enabling them effectively to attain the objective pursued by their domestic laws, are the least detrimental to the objectives and the principles laid down by the relevant EU legislation (see, to that effect, judgments of 18 December 1997, Molenheide and Others, C‑286/94, C‑340/95, C‑401/95 and C‑47/96, EU:C:1997:623, paragraph 46, and of 22 October 2015, Impresa Edilux and SICEF, C‑425/14, EU:C:2015:721, paragraph 29 and the case-law cited). The case-law of the Court states in that regard that, when there is a choice between several appropriate measures, recourse must be had to the least onerous, and the disadvantages caused must not be disproportionate to the aims pursued (judgments of 12 July 2001, Jippes and Others, C‑189/01, EU:C:2001:420, paragraph 81, and of 9 March 2010, ERG and Others, C‑379/08 and C‑380/08, EU:C:2010:127, paragraph 86).</p>

            <p>Second, as far as concerns the appropriate nature of the contested measure, it must be stated that the prohibition on marketing and sales of packets of cigarettes after March of the year following that in which they were released for consumption has the effect of removing any incentive for economic operators to release excessive quantities of tobacco products in anticipation of a future increase of excise duty, because they will be obliged to remove unsold packets from the market after that period. To the contrary, the absence of contested measure would prevent or delay the future increase in the rate of excise duty from taking effect, which gives rise generally to an increase in the retail sale price of packets of cigarettes.</p>

            <p>Therefore, that measure is appropriate to achieve legitimate objectives that are combating tax evasion and tax avoidance and the protection of public health. As regards the latter objective, it must be added that the Court has already held that fiscal legislation is an important and effective instrument for discouraging consumption of tobacco products and, therefore, for the protection of public health (judgments of 5 October 2006, Valeško, C‑140/05, EU:C:2006:647, paragraph 58 and of 4 March 2010, Commission v France, C‑197/08, EU:C:2010:111, paragraph 52).</p>

            <p>That measure also prevents operators with substantial economic power from enjoying a competitive advantage by oversupplying the market as compared with competitors with a lesser financial capacity and, therefore, helps to ensure healthy competition.</p>

            <p>Third, as far as concerns the need for the contested measure, it must be pointed out that, according to established case-law, it is for the Commission to prove the alleged failure to fulfil obligations. It is the Commission which must provide the Court with the information necessary for it to determine whether the infringement is made out, and the Commission may not rely on any presumption for that purpose (judgment of 24 November 2016, Commission v Spain, C‑461/14, EU:C:2016:895, paragraph 50 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_11848__content">
            <p>In that connection, first, as far as concerns the Commission's argument that the quantitative limits on the release for consumption of cigarettes, provided for in Article 106 of the CIEC, already constitute in themselves a measure sufficient to achieve the objectives pursued, it must be observed that, by virtue of that provision, release for consumption of cigarettes cannot, in the period between 1 September and 31 December inclusive of each calendar year, exceed the quantitative limits deriving from the application of a multiplying factor of 10% to the monthly amount of cigarettes released for consumption in the course of the preceding year.</p>

            <p>However, it must be stated that that provision may be circumvented by an economic operator which chooses to release excessive quantities of cigarettes for consumption in the period before 1 September. In that connection, as is clear from the data provided by the</p>
            <p>
              <organization refersTo="#institution_48">Portuguese Republic</organization>
            </p>
            <p>, releases for consumption of cigarettes increased, in August 2014 by 241% as compared with the monthly average. Therefore, it does not appear that the quantitative limits laid down in Article 106 CIEC are sufficient in themselves to effectively combat the release for consumption of excessive quantities of cigarettes in anticipation of an increase in the rate of excise duty.</p>

            <p>Second, as regards the Commission's argument based on the three-month time limit laid down by the contested measure, it must be stated that the Commission does not dispute the need to set a time limit in order to achieve the objectives pursued, but criticises the</p>
            <p>
              <organization refersTo="#institution_48">Portuguese Republic</organization>
            </p>
            <p>for setting a time limit which is too short. In that regard, it refers to Directive 2001/37 which lays down new requirements applicable to the labelling of tobacco products and, with respect to cigarettes, imposes a one-year transitional period for compliance with those requirements.</p>

          <content eId="para_11851__content">
            <p>In that connection, it must be observed that a period of sale which is extended until the end of the year following that in which cigarettes are released for consumption would have the result that the new rate of excise duty would apply to the cigarettes released for consumption, at the latest, only one year after the entry into force of the tax increase. As the Advocate General observed in substance in paragraph 41 of her Opinion, such a long period of sale would substantially reduce the effectiveness of Article 27 of Decree No 1295/2007.</p>

              <organization refersTo="#institution_48">Portuguese Republic</organization>
            </p>
            <p>'s argument that the three-month time limit is sufficient, given that the average length of the turnover of stock of cigarettes is two months, the Commission simply asserts that that is an average period and that time limit does not take account of seasonal variations or the fact that the turnover is longer for cigarettes of lesser known brands, without presenting any detailed argument in support of its arguments explaining what, in its view, would be a reasonable time limit.</p>

          <content eId="para_11853__content">
            <p>Furthermore, it must be held that, in any event, the three-month time limit during which cigarettes may be marketed and sold concerns only those which were released for consumption at the end of December of the previous calendar year. In the case where cigarettes are released for consumption in January or February of the same year as that corresponding to the tax marking affixed, they may be sold until March of the following year, which leaves a period of 14 to 15 months to dispose of them. Thus, the earlier in the year the cigarettes are released for consumption the longer the time limit for disposing of them.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the fact that Article 27 of Decree No 1295/2007 lays down longer time limits for fine-cut tobacco for rolling cigarettes and other smoking tobacco and for cigars and cigarillos does not challenge that finding since those products are different from ordinary cigarettes in that they each have their own turnover period.</p>

            <p>Third, as regards the Commission's argument based on the lack of any significant increase in excise duty on tobacco products in Portugal in recent years, it must be observed that the contested measure applies in all cases, including in the case in which the rate of excise duty decreases or stays the same. In such circumstances, the incentive for economic operators to supply excessive quantities of cigarettes during a specific year is minimal or non-existent, since the excise duty that they have to pay in the following year will not have increased. Consequently, in such circumstances, the contested measure does not appear necessary to achieve the objectives pursued.</p>

            <p>'s submissions, the objectives pursued could be achieved in a manner which is less restrictive and just as appropriate if the contested measure applied only in the case of an increase in the rate of excise duty on cigarettes.

            <p>It follows that, in so far as the contested measure also applies in the absence of any increase in excise duty, the first plea in law is well-founded, as the Advocate General observed, in paragraph 46 of her Opinion. For the remainder of the plea in law, it follows from the foregoing considerations that the arguments relied on by the Commission regarding the need for that measure cannot be accepted.</p>

            <p>First, as regards the Commission's argument relating to the existence of an irrebuttable presumption, according to which all packets of cigarettes which are not sold after the expiry of the time limit laid down in Article 27 of Decree No 1295/2007 must be regarded has having been released for consumption in excessive quantities, the Commission refers in that regard to the judgment of 18 December 1997, Molenheide and Others ( C‑286/94, C‑340/95, C‑401/95 and C‑47/96, EU:C:1997:623), in which the Court held, as regards the protective attachment of a refundable value added tax credit, that an irrebuttable presumption would go beyond what is necessary to ensure effective recovery and would undermine the principle of proportionality, in that it would not allow the taxable person to adduce evidence in rebuttal for consideration by the judge hearing attachment proceedings.</p>

            <p>Moreover, as the Advocate General observed in paragraph 49 of her Opinion, giving economic operators the opportunity to prove that the cigarettes were released for consumption not in excessive quantities, but in `normal' quantities, as the Commission has called for, would require a case-by-case examination and would represent a considerable administrative burden. Such an approach would make the Portuguese scheme significantly more difficult to manage and would, moreover, be fraught with uncertainties, such as how to determine appropriate reference quantities. According to the case-law of the Court, Member States cannot be denied the possibility of attaining an objective such as combating tax evasion and tax avoidance, and the protection of public health and healthy and fair competition by the introduction of general and simple rules which will be easily understood and applied by drivers and easily managed and supervised by the competent authorities (see, to that effect, judgments of 10 February 2009, Commission v Italy, C‑110/05, EU:C:2009:66, paragraph 67, and of 24 March 2011, Commission v Spain, C‑400/08, EU:C:2011:172, paragraph 124).</p>

            <p>Second, as regards the Commission's argument relating to the costs that economic operators must bear as a result of the contested measure, it is clear from the file that, since December 2012, economic operators which have not managed to sell all the packets of cigarettes released for consumption on the expiry of the time limit laid down by Article 27(a) of Decree No 1295/2007 can choose between the destruction of those goods accompanied by the reimbursement of the tax paid, which represents 78.08% of the price of the cigarettes, and their re-release for consumption by affixing new tax markings.</p>

            <p>Economic operators must only bear those costs if they release excessive quantities of packets of cigarettes for consumption. It is not disputed that the market for cigarettes is characterised by a relatively stable demand and by the fact that economic operators are familiar with the behaviour of that market. Furthermore, the rate of excise duty applicable in a particular year is known in advance, that is on 15 October of the previous year. It follows that economic operators are able to make well-informed predictions regarding the demand for cigarettes so as to avoid the excessive accumulation of stocks which might require them to withdraw unsold packets of cigarettes from the market and, therefore, to bear the costs related to their destruction or re-packaging. Therefore, the Commission's argument relating to the costs generated by the contested measure must be dismissed.</p>

            <p>Third, the Commission's argument that the sanctions laid down in Article 109 of the GRTO are disproportionate on the ground that they may be up to EUR 165000, it must be stated that, pursuant to the provisions laid down in Article 109 of the GRTO, cited by the Commission, the offences mentioned therein are punishable by a fine of EUR 250 to EUR 165000 or EUR 500 to EUR 165000. The Commission has not established or even alleged that the system of fines has been applied disproportionately.</p>

            <p>The Commission submits that the contested measure also infringes Article 39(3) of Directive 2008/118, as it creates impediments to the free movement of goods subject to excise duty. The fear on the part of importers of being unable, in the case of an increase in excise duty, to sell cigarettes within the period laid down in Article 27(a) of Decree No 1295/2007 may dissuade them from making normal purchases, in particular from other Member States, and therefore affect trade at a level which goes beyond what is necessary to combat, in particular, the release for consumption of excessive quantities of cigarettes before the increase of excise duty.</p>

            <p>It must be stated that Article 27(a) of Decree No 1295/2007 merely provides that cigarette packets may be marketed and sold until the end of the third month of the year following that which appears on the tax marking affixed. Such a temporal limitation on the marketing and sale of cigarettes, complained of by the Commission, is not therefore a consequence of the use of a tax marking and linked to their use only in so far as reference is made to the year indicated on them, as the Advocate General points out in paragraph 56 of her Opinion. Moreover, the year of release for consumption could also be made apparent by means other than the tax marking on cigarette packets.</p>
