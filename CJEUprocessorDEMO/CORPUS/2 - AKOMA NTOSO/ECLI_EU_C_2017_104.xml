In the first case, the court with jurisdiction took the view that an applicant could issue an application for enforcement of a decision directly in the Family Court and that there must be an error in the domestic legislation, which requires the application to be issued through the Central Authority. In the second case, which concerned an application for modification, as opposed to enforcement, of a decision, the court with jurisdiction expressed reservations in relation to the decision in the first case, taking the view that the applicant must necessarily issue the application through the Central Authority. The referring court adds that, when questioned on the subject in connection with the main proceedings, REMO stated that there was no error in the national legislation, which requires recourse to be had to the Central Authority, and that the wording of the national provisions at issue was intended.</p>

            <p>As it refers to the application of the law of the Member State of enforcement, the first sentence of that provision might, prima facie, be interpreted as meaning that a Member State of enforcement may provide, in its rules governing enforcement procedures, that recourse must be had to the central authority of the requested State.</p>

            <p>However, in the light of the wording of the second sentence of that provision, which states that the decision must be enforced `under the same conditions' as a decision given in the Member State of enforcement, it might be considered that Article 41(1) precludes mandatory recourse to the Central Authority if that is not a requirement in purely domestic cases, as is the case in the Member State to which the referring court belongs.</p>

            <p>With regard to the purpose of Regulation No 4/2009, it is apparent from the preparatory works, in particular the Commission's Green Paper of 15 April 2004 on maintenance obligations (COM(2004) 254 final), that the EU legislature intended to replace the provisions on maintenance obligations in Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters ( OJ 2001 L 12, p. 1) with provisions which, in view of the particularly urgent nature of maintenance claims, simplify the procedure before the enforcing court, thus making it quicker.</p>

            <p>The Court has stated, in that regard, that the objective of Regulation No 4/2009 is to facilitate as far as possible the recovery of international maintenance claims (judgment of 18 December 2014, Sanders and Huber, C‑400/13 and C‑408/13, EU:C:2014:2461, paragraph 41).</p>

            <p>Those objectives of simplicity and speed are also apparent from recitals 9 and 27 of Regulation No 4/2009. Recital 9 states that a maintenance creditor should be able to obtain easily, in a Member State, a decision which will be automatically enforceable in another Member State without further formalities. According to recital 27, one of the objectives of Regulation No 4/2009 is to limit as far as possible the formal enforcement requirements likely to increase the costs to be borne by the maintenance creditor.</p>

            <p>Mention should also be made of recitals 31 and 32 of Regulation No 4/2009. Recital 31 makes clear the legislature's intention to establish a system of cooperation between central authorities to facilitate cross-border recovery of maintenance claims and to assist maintenance creditors in asserting their rights in another Member State. Recital 32 defines recourse to such assistance as `a right'.</p>

Under the heading `Abolition of equatur', Article 17 of Regulation No 4/2009, which forms part of Chapter IV, provides in paragraph 1 thereof that such decisions are to be recognised in another Member State without any special procedure being required. Article 20 of the regulation, also in Chapter IV, specifies, in paragraph 1 thereof, the documents which the claimant must provide to the `the competent enforcement authorities'; that wording suggest that documents may be submitted directly to the competent authorities.</p>

            <p>Provision is made for the issuing of proceedings via the Central Authorities in Chapter VII of Regulation No 4/2009, concerning cooperation between Central Authorities. Pursuant to Article 51(1) of the regulation, those authorities are to provide assistance in relation to applications under Article 56, inter alia by transmitting applications. Article 56 provides that a creditor seeking to recover maintenance `may' make an application for, inter alia, enforcement of a decision given or recognised in the requested Member State. In that case, the creditor is required, pursuant to Article 55 of the regulation, to submit her application to the Central Authority of the Member State in which she resides, which will transmit it to the Central Authority of the requested Member States.</p>

            <p>It follows from Articles 51 and 56 of Regulation No 4/2009, read in the light of recitals 31 and 32 thereof, that a person has a right but is not under any obligation to make an application to the Central Authorities for assistance pursuant to the provisions in Chapter VII of the regulation. It is, therefore, optional and that right will be exercised only if the maintenance creditor wishes to avail herself of it, in order, for example, to overcome certain specific difficulties, such as the location of the maintenance debtor.</p>
