                </tblock>
                <p>17 By its third question, which it is appropriate to examine first, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 9 of Directive 2001/29, and specifically the concept of `access to cable of broadcasting services', must be interpreted as covering and permitting national legislation which provides that copyright is not infringed in the case of the immediate retransmission by cable, including, where relevant, via the internet, in the area of initial broadcast, of works broadcast on television channels subject to public service obligations.</p>

            <p>In this connection, it should be noted that, in the absence of any express reference to the laws of the Member States, the concept of `access to cable of broadcasting services', in Article 9 of Directive 2001/29, must be given an autonomous and uniform interpretation throughout the European Union which takes into account the wording of that provision, its context and the objectives of the legislation of which it forms part (see, to that effect, judgments of 21 October 2010, Padawan, C‑467/08, EU:C:2010:620, paragraph 32, and of 10 November 2016, Private Equity Insurance Group, C‑156/15, EU:C:2016:851, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_1676__content">
            <p>In the first place, it is apparent from the very term `access to cable' that that concept is different from that of `retransmission by cable', since only the latter concept designates, within the framework of Directive 2001/29, the transmission of audiovisual content.</p>

          <content eId="para_1677__content">
            <p>In the second place, as regards the context of Article 9 of Directive 2001/29, as the Advocate General noted at point 55 of his Opinion, that directive already contains, in Article 1(2)(c), a provision which deals expressly with `cable retransmission', and excludes from the scope of that directive the provisions of EU law governing that question, in this instance, those of Directive 93/83.</p>

            <p>In so far as the point needs to be made, it should be noted that the provisions of Directive 93/83 are irrelevant to the main proceedings. The main proceedings concern a retransmission within one Member State whereas Directive 93/83 provides for minimal harmonisation of certain aspects of protection of copyright and related rights solely in the case of communication to the public by satellite or cable retransmission of programmes from other Member States (judgment of 7 December 2006, SGAE, C‑306/05, EU:2006:764, paragraph 30).</p>

            <p>In the third place, as regards the objective of Directive 2001/29, the principal objective of that directive is to establish a high level of protection of authors, allowing them to obtain an appropriate reward for the use of their works, including on the occasion of communication to the public (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 October 2011, Football Association Premier League and Others, C‑403/08 and C‑429/08, EU:C:2011:631, paragraph 186).</p>

          <content eId="para_1680__content">
            <p>Having regard to that high level of protection of authors, the Court -- ruling on a question referred in the action at first instance from which the main proceedings have arisen -- held that the concept of `communication to the public' in Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/29 must be interpreted broadly, as recital 23 of that directive expressly states, and that a retransmission by means of an internet stream, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, constitutes such a communication (see, to that effect, judgment of 7 March 2013, ITV Broadcasting and Others, C‑607/11, EU:C:2013:147, paragraphs 20 and 40).</p>

          <num>24</num>
          <content eId="para_1681__content">
            <p>It follows that, in the absence of the consent of the author concerned, such a retransmission is not, as a rule, permitted, unless it falls within the scope of Article 5 of Directive 2001/29, which sets out an exhaustive list of exceptions and limitations to the right of communication to the public established in Article 3 of that directive, as recital 32 thereof confirms.</p>

          <content eId="para_1682__content">
            <p>In the present case, it is common ground that the retransmission at issue in the main proceedings does not fall within the scope of any of the exceptions and limitations set out exhaustively in Article 5 of Directive 2001/29.</p>

          <content eId="para_1683__content">
            <p>As regards Article 9 of Directive 2001/29, as the Advocate General noted at points 37 and 38 of his Opinion, it is apparent from that provision, read in the light of recital 60 of that directive, that Article 9 is intended to maintain the provisions applicable in areas other than that harmonised by the directive.</p>

          <content eId="para_1684__content">
            <p>Indeed, an interpretation of Article 9 of Directive 2001/29 to the effect that it permits a retransmission, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, without the consent of the authors, in cases other than those provided for in Article 5 of that directive, would run counter not only to the objective of Article 9, but also to the exhaustive nature of Article 5, and, consequently, would be detrimental to the achievement of the principal objective of that directive which is to establish a high level of protection of authors.</p>

            <p>It is irrelevant whether the protected works were initially broadcast on television channels subject to public service obligations. Indeed, there is no basis in Directive 2001/29 that would justify affording less protection to those channels' content.</p>

            <p>In the light of all those considerations, the answer to the third question is that Article 9 of Directive 2001/29, and specifically the concept of `access to cable of broadcasting services', must be interpreted as not covering, and not permitting, national legislation which provides that copyright is not infringed in the case of the immediate retransmission by cable, including, where relevant, via the internet, in the area of initial broadcast, of works broadcast on television channels subject to public service obligations.</p>

Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby rules: Article 9 of Directive 2001/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 22 May 2001 on the harmonisation of certain aspects of copyright and related rights in the information society, and specifically the concept of `access to cable of broadcasting services', must be interpreted as not covering, and not permitting, national legislation which provides that copyright is not infringed in the case of the immediate retransmission by cable, including, where relevant, via the internet, in the area of initial broadcast, of works broadcast on television channels subject to public service obligations.</p>
