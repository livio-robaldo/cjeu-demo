That infringement, in which 17 undertakings had allegedly participated, was said to have taken place over various periods between 16 October 1992 and 9 November 2004 and to have taken the form of anticompetitive agreements or concerted practices covering the territory of Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria.</p>

            <p>Following a hearing, which took place from 12 to 14 November 2007, in which the applicants at first instance took part, the sending, on 9 July 2009, of a letter of facts, drawing their attention to certain evidence on which the Commission was minded to rely when adopting a final decision, and further requests for information that were subsequently addressed to the applicants, the Commission, on 23 June 2010, adopted the decision at issue. By that decision the Commission held that the practices described in paragraph 8 of the present judgment formed part of an overall plan to restrict competition among the addressees of that decision and had the characteristics of a single and continuous infringement, which covered the three product sub-groups and extended to Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria. In that regard, the Commission highlighted, in particular, the fact that those practices had followed a recurring pattern which was consistent in each of the six Member States covered by the Commission's investigation. The Commission also pointed to the existence of national industry associations concerning all three product sub-groups, which it termed `umbrella associations', national industry associations with members active in at least two of those three product sub-groups, which it termed `cross-product associations', as well as product-specific associations with members active in only one of those three product sub-groups. Lastly, it found that a central group of undertakings participated in the cartel in several Member States and in cross-product associations and umbrella associations.</p>

As regards the infringement in the Netherlands, the Commission found, in essence, in recital 1179 of the decision at issue, that the undertakings that had taken part in it could no longer be fined for the infringement because the limitation period had expired.</p>

            <p>The General Court held in paragraph 395 of the judgment under appeal that the Commission had not established that Villeroy &amp; Boch had taken part in the single infringement at issue before 12 October 1994. The General Court's partial annulment of Article 1(7) of the decision at issue nevertheless did not affect the amount of the fines imposed on Villeroy &amp; Boch in Article 2(8) of that decision. In fact, in setting the fine, the Commission had taken into account the fact that Villeroy &amp; Boch participated in an infringement only from 12 October 1994, as is apparent from Table D in the decision at issue.</p>

            <p>It submits that the General Court (the same Chamber and the same Judge Rapporteur) made, on the same day and in respect of the same issues and the same decision, diametrically opposed assessments of two items of evidence -- -- namely the statements made in the context of the leniency programme by Ideal Standard and the statements made by Roca -- -- in the judgment under appeal and the judgment of 16 September 2013, Keramag Keramische Werke and Others v Commission ( T‑379/10 and T‑381/10, not published, EU:T:2013:457, paragraphs 118 to 120), in breach of the principle of equal treatment and the presumption of innocence, to Villeroy &amp; Boch's detriment.</p>

            <p>In paragraphs 287 to 290 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court took the view that Ideal Standard's statements and Roca's statements had enabled it to be established that Villeroy &amp; Boch France had taken part in three AFICS meetings organised in 2004, at which unlawful discussions had taken place. In that regard, the General Court, in essence, recalled that a statement provided by an undertaking that has applied for leniency may not, in accordance with the principle testis unus, testis nullus(one witness is no witness), serve as proof unless such a statement is supported by statements from other cartel participants. However, there was, according to the General Court, such support in the present case, since the statement provided by Ideal Standard in its leniency application was confirmed by Roca's statement.</p>

            <p>According to Villeroy &amp; Boch, the assessment of the evidence thus made by the General Court is clearly inconsistent with the assessment of the same evidence made in the judgment of 16 September 2013, Keramag Keramische Werke and Others v Commission ( T‑379/10 and T‑381/10, not published, EU:T:2013:457, paragraphs 118 to 120), which also concerns the decision at issue.</p>

            <p>Likewise, Villeroy &amp; Boch submits that the General Court's assessments in that judgment and in the judgment under appeal of the evidential value of the statement made by Duravit AG are contradictory and that the General Court thus infringed the principle that evidence should be treated in the same way, as well as the principle of in dubio pro reo. In the judgment of 16 September 2013, Keramag Keramische Werke and Others v Commission ( T‑379/10 and T‑381/10, not published, EU:T:2013:457, paragraphs 115 and 116), the General Court held that that statement could not be relied on as against the applicants in that case since it had not been communicated to them in the administrative procedure. By contrast, in the judgment under appeal, the General Court accepted that Duravit's statement should be taken into account. Thus, in paragraph 293 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court stated that, although the decision at issue `does not rely' on that statement, the fact remains that it confirmed Ideal Standard's statement regarding the content of unlawful discussions that were held `probably' on 24 February 2004.</p>

            <p>In order to address the first ground of appeal, it must be recalled that the assessment by the General Court of the evidential value of a document may not, as a rule, be subject to review by the Court of Justice in appeal proceedings. As is clear from Article 256 TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal lies on points of law only. The General Court therefore has sole jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence, except where those facts and that evidence have been distorted (see, inter alia, judgment of 2 October 2003, Salzgitter v Commission, C‑182/99 P, EU:C:2003:526, paragraph 43 and the case-law cited), an allegation that has not been made in the present case.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, it is settled case-law that the question whether the grounds of a judgment of the General Court are contradictory or sufficient is a question of law which is amenable, as such, to review on appeal (see, inter alia, judgment of 21 September 2006, Nederlandse Federatieve Vereniging voor de Groothandel op Elektrotechnisch Gebied v Commission, C‑105/04 P, EU:C:2006:592, paragraph 71 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the present case, the General Court, in paragraph 287 of the judgment under appeal, found that the Commission relied on the statements of Ideal Standard and Roca in order to establish that Villeroy &amp; Boch France had participated in the AFICS meetings in 2004. In paragraph 289 of that judgment the General Court pointed out that, whilst it is clear from the case-law that a statement made by a party that has benefited from the cancellation or reduction of its fine, which is disputed by another party, must be corroborated, there is nothing to prevent such corroboration being provided by evidence proffered by another undertaking that has participated in the cartel, even if that other party has also benefited from a reduction in its fine. After examining the evidential value of the statement made by Roca, the General Court, in paragraph 290 of that judgment, concluded that it had to be held that Ideal Standard's statement, corroborated by that of Roca, proved to the requisite legal standard that the unlawful discussions at issue had taken place.</p>

            <p>As regards Villeroy &amp; Boch's argument that the General Court could not rely on Duravit's statement as against it, that argument is based on a misreading of the judgment under appeal. In fact, Duravit's statement is mentioned, in paragraph 293 of the judgment under appeal, solely for the purpose of responding to an argument advanced by the applicants at first instance which invoked that statement and sought to cast doubt on the veracity of the statements made by Ideal Standard and Roca. Accordingly, the General Court did not use Duravit's statement as inculpatory evidence with regard to Villeroy &amp; Boch, as is confirmed by paragraph 295 of the judgment under appeal, in which the General Court found that the statements made by Ideal Standard and Roca were sufficient to establish the existence of an infringement of Article 101(1) TFEU.</p>

            <p>By its second ground of appeal, which is divided into two parts, Villeroy &amp; Boch submits, first, that the General Court infringed the obligation to state reasons inasmuch as, in paragraph 233 of the judgment under appeal, it rejected Villeroy &amp; Boch's plea concerning the absence of any infringement in Italy, relying on the incorrect premiss that Villeroy &amp; Boch had not denied that it had been aware that anticompetitive practices were being implemented in Italy.</p>

          <content eId="para_12184__content">
            <p>Second, Villeroy &amp; Boch argues that the judgment under appeal offends against the rules of logic and the prohibition of discrimination so far as concerns the assessment of the facts and the imputation of the infringement allegedly committed in Italy. It submits that, in paragraph 234 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court imputed that infringement to it, which was committed by a third party, on the basis of Villeroy &amp; Boch's alleged knowledge of the infringement, even though it did not carry on business in Italy and had not attended the meetings of the trade association in Italy. It argues that, at the same time, the main complaints raised against the alleged key perpetrators of the same infringement were wholly or largely discounted in three other judgments concerning the decision at issue that were handed down on the same day by the same Chamber of the General Court composed of the same judges.</p>

In that judgment the General Court stated that, even though it was established that the undertakings of the Ideal Standard group had taken part in meetings of the trade association in Italy at which discussions contrary to the competition rules had taken place, they were not to be held liable so far as the period from March 1993 to March 2000 was concerned.</p>

Furthermore, point 59 of the application for annulment relates to the first plea for annulment rather than to the third part of the third plea for annulment; consequently the General Court cannot be criticised for not addressing point 59 in the analysis of that third part in paragraphs 231 to 234 of the judgment under appeal.</p>

Accordingly, if the different actions form part of an `overall plan' because their identical object distorts competition in the internal market, the Commission is entitled to impute responsibility for those actions on the basis of participation in the infringement considered as a whole (see judgment of 24 June 2015, Fresh Del Monte Produce v Commission and Commission v Fresh Del Monte Produce, C‑293/13 P and C‑294/13 P, EU:C:2015:416, paragraph 156 and the case-law cited).</p>

That is the position where it is shown that the undertaking intended, through its own conduct, to contribute to the common objectives pursued by all the participants and that it was aware of the offending conduct planned or put into effect by other undertakings in pursuit of the same objectives or that it could reasonably have foreseen it and was prepared to take the risk (see judgment of 24 June 2015, Fresh Del Monte Produce v Commission and Commission v Fresh Del Monte Produce, C‑293/13 P and C‑294/13 P, EU:C:2015:416, paragraph 157 and the case-law cited).</p>

In such cases, the Commission is also entitled to attribute liability to that undertaking in relation to all the forms of anticompetitive conduct comprising such an infringement and, accordingly, in relation to the infringement as a whole (see judgment of 24 June 2015, Fresh Del Monte Produce v Commission and Commission v Fresh Del Monte Produce, C‑293/13 P and C‑294/13 P, EU:C:2015:416, paragraph 158 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Moreover, for the purpose of characterising various instances of conduct as a single and continuous infringement, it is not necessary to ascertain whether they present a link of complementarity, in the sense that each of them is intended to deal with one or more consequences of the normal pattern of competition, and, through interaction, contribute to the attainment of the set of anticompetitive effects desired by those responsible, within the framework of a global plan having a single objective. By contrast, the condition relating to a single objective requires that it be ascertained whether there are any elements characterising the various instances of conduct forming part of the infringement which are capable of indicating that the instances of conduct in fact implemented by other participating undertakings do not have an identical object or identical anticompetitive effect and, consequently, do not form part of an `overall plan' as a result of their identical object distorting the normal pattern of competition within the internal market (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 December 2013, Siemens and Others v Commission, C‑239/11 P, C‑489/11 P and C‑498/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:866, paragraphs 247 and 248).</p>

            <p>By the second part of its third ground of appeal, Villeroy &amp; Boch maintains that point 2 of the operative part of the judgment under appeal and the grounds of the judgment are clearly contradictory. It submits that the Commission had initially considered there to be a continuous infringement of over five years' duration in the Netherlands. The General Court, in paragraph 321 of the judgment under appeal, ultimately held, however, that Villeroy &amp; Boch could be penalised for the Netherlands infringement only for periods running, first, from 26 November 1996 to 1 December 1997 and, second, from 20 January to 1 December 1999. In accordance with its own statements, the General Court should -- as was done in point 2 of the operative part of the judgment under appeal with regard to the German infringement -- have annulled the decision at issue in that respect, in so far as it was stated therein that Villeroy &amp; Boch participated in a cartel in the bathroom fittings and fixtures sector for periods in excess of the periods mentioned above. Villeroy &amp; Boch argues that the General Court failed to take this into account: that amounts to an error of law, the consequence of which is that the judgment under appeal must be set aside, at least in part.</p>

            <p>In order to address the first part of the third ground of appeal, it should be recalled, as regards, in the first place, Villeroy &amp; Boch's argument concerning an infringement of Article 263 TFEU, that, according to settled case-law, it follows from Article 256 TFEU, Article 58, first paragraph, of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and Article 169(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice that an appeal must indicate precisely the contested elements of the judgment which the appellant seeks to have set aside and also the legal arguments specifically advanced in support of the appeal. Where an appeal merely reproduces the pleas in law and arguments previously submitted to the General Court, without even including an argument specifically identifying the error of law allegedly vitiating the judgment under appeal, it fails to satisfy that requirement. Such an appeal amounts in reality to no more than a request for a re-examination of the application submitted to the General Court, which the Court of Justice does not have jurisdiction to undertake (see, to that effect, judgments of 30 June 2005, Eurocermex v OHIM, C‑286/04 P, EU:C:2005:422, paragraphs 49 and 50, and of 12 September 2006, Reynolds Tobacco and Others v Commission, C‑131/03 P, EU:C:2006:541, paragraphs 49 and 50).</p>

It then held, in paragraph 304 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had such an interest in the present case. To reinforce its finding that a single infringement had been committed, the Commission had, in the General Court's view, a legitimate interest in making a finding in respect of all the unlawful practices in which undertakings such as Villeroy &amp; Boch -- -- which the Commission considered formed part of a `central group of undertakings' that had implemented the infringement complained of -- -- had allegedly participated, including in respect of periods which might be regarded as being time-barred.</p>

Moreover, in Case T‑374/10, the General Court -- -- contrary to what has been argued by Villeroy &amp; Boch and as is clear when paragraph 321 of the judgment under appeal is read in conjunction with paragraph 395 thereof -- -- annulled the decision at issue in part not because it considered that the Commission had made an error of assessment with regard to the infringement in Germany, but rather because the Commission had failed to establish to the requisite legal standard that Villeroy &amp; Boch had participated in an infringement in the Netherlands from 28 September 1994.</p>

            <p>By its fourth ground of appeal, which is divided into four parts, Villeroy &amp; Boch argues, in the first place, that an incorrect account was given of the submissions made by it in the proceedings concerning the acts committed in Belgium, which resulted in an error in the reasoning of the judgment under appeal, contrary to the second paragraph of Article 296 TFEU. It submits that the grounds set out by the General Court, in paragraph 243 et seq. of the judgment, are based on the incorrect premiss that Mr Z. continued to be a member of the staff of Villeroy &amp; Boch Belgium after 1 January 2003. The appellant argues that, in fact, as it explained at the hearing before the General Court and as the General Court itself noted, Mr Z. ceased to have, with effect from that date, any organisational tie, or relationship under an employment contract, with Villeroy &amp; Boch Belgium, which thus precludes any imputation of those acts to the appellant.</p>

          <content eId="para_12217__content">
            <p>In the second place, the appellant submits, in the alternative, that the General Court infringed Article 101 TFEU in holding that Villeroy &amp; Boch Belgium had participated in a ceramics infringement in Belgium when it had not been active on that market since the end of 2002. In particular, the General Court failed to indicate which `offending acts' the company could, after its withdrawal from the market, have coordinated with the other cartel participants in order to restrict competition on that market. The appellant submits that, in the light of the reasoning of the General Court in the judgments of 16 September 2013, Wabco Europe and Others v Commission ( T‑380/10, EU:T:2013:449, paragraph 79 et seq.), and of 16 September 2013, Keramag Keramische Werke and Others v Commission ( T‑379/10 and T‑381/10, not published, EU:T:2013:457, paragraph 222 et seq.), liability for the acts of third parties, which it maintains were committed after the date of that withdrawal from the market, cannot be imputed to Villeroy &amp; Boch Belgium, or indirectly to the appellant. As the General Court indicated in those judgments, such a complaint would have required the other constituent elements of a single infringement to be established, more specifically the corresponding `object' or `effect' of the restrictions of competition on the Belgian market, a condition which is clearly not met in the present case. In any event, the conflicting assessments of the facts in the judgment under appeal and the judgment of 16 September 2013, Wabco Europe and Others v Commission ( T‑380/10, EU:T:2013:449), constitutes an infringement of the principle of equal treatment to the appellant's detriment.</p>

            <p>In the third place, as regards proof of the existence of concerted practices at the meetings on 28 and 29 April 2003 in Belgium, Villeroy &amp; Boch submits that the General Court's appraisal of the evidence, in paragraph 271 of the judgment under appeal, amounted merely to the observation that the fact that no single rate was agreed upon for wholesaler bonuses `does not preclude the possibility that competition was distorted by the exchange of information in question'. However, even if that proposition of the General Court were considered to be correct, that would not suffice, as a matter of logic, to prove the infringement. There is, in the appellant's submission, either an infringement of the obligation to state reasons, laid down in the second paragraph of Article 296 TFEU, or an infringement of the principle of in dubio pro reo inherent in Article 48(1) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union ( `the Charter').</p>

Thus, it was only during the oral procedure before the General Court that Villeroy &amp; Boch, for the first time, expressly put forward its contention that it could not be held liable for anticompetitive conduct on the Belgian ceramics market from 1 January 2003 onwards, because the person who attended the cartel meetings, namely Mr Z., had, since that date, been employed by Villeroy &amp; Boch Luxembourg rather than by Villeroy &amp; Boch Belgium.</p>

However, in accordance with the case-law of the Court of Justice, the General Court cannot be required, every time that a party raises, in the course of the procedure, a new plea in law which clearly does not satisfy the requirements of Article 48(2) of its Rules of Procedure, either to explain in its judgment the reasons for which that plea is inadmissible, or to examine it in detail (see, inter alia, judgment of 20 March 2014, Rousse Industry v Commission, C‑271/13 P, not published, EU:C:2014:175, paragraph 22 and the case-law cited).</p>

The General Court indicated that Villeroy &amp; Boch did not dispute that, according to the minutes of the last-mentioned meeting, `the ceramics manufacturers had agreed that an increase in the costs of road tolls should not be borne by the ceramics manufacturers alone but should be passed on to their customers' and also that it did not dispute `the credibility' of those minutes.

            <p>First, Villeroy &amp; Boch submits that the judgment under appeal is insufficiently reasoned in that the General Court did not give the reasons why it considered that the discussions that took place at the meeting on 20 July 2004 could reduce the secrecy of competition protected under Article 101 TFEU.</p>

            <p>Secondly, Villeroy &amp; Boch argues that the communication of an undertaking's, or a group's, total turnover for the preceding business year to competitors or to non-competing third parties, the exchange of information concerning an increase in exports and the communication of forecasts relating to increases in turnover or of statistics on the development of turnover cannot be classified as breaches of Article 101 TFEU. No conclusion may be drawn on the basis of those commercial data alone as to the practices of the undertaking concerned on the market, to the profitability of its operations or as to the strategy it has in mind for attaining the goals set for the development of turnover. Thus no market operator could, on the basis of the information exchanged, anticipate with greater certainty the future commercial conduct of its competitors on the market. Furthermore, some of those data are published regularly and promptly by virtually all undertakings, such publication being, in most cases, compulsory under commercial law, the law governing capital markets and the rules applying to concentrations.</p>

In fact, in paragraphs 116 and 117 of that judgment the General Court found only that that exchange of information established that, between 2001 and 2003, Villeroy &amp; Boch and its competitors had not stopped passing sensitive business information to one another. Thus, the General Court did not hold that that exchange, on its own, infringed Article 101 TFEU.</p>

In that regard, the General Court did not err in law in holding that discussions during which the ceramics manufacturers agreed that the increase in road toll costs should be passed on to the customers remove uncertainty between competitors and amount to price coordination, so that such discussions constitute an anticompetitive practice even if third parties or the public would have foreseen that there would be such a passing on of costs.</p>

Contrary to the appellant's assertion, the General Court set out, in paragraphs 123 and 149 of the judgment under appeal, the reasons why it considered that the exchanges of information referred to in paragraphs 121 and 148 of that judgment were anticompetitive. Thus, the General Court noted that those exchanges supported the coordination of price increases that was decided upon in 2003 for the year 2004 and that they made it possible for Villeroy &amp; Boch and its competitors to anticipate with greater certainty their respective future commercial conduct on the market.

            <p>Concerning the years 1995 to 1997, the General Court, in paragraphs 185, 190 and 196 of the judgment under appeal, observed that Villeroy &amp; Boch Austria took part in unlawful discussions at the meetings on 16 November 1995, 23 April 1996 and 15 October 1997.</p>

            <p>However, as regards the meeting on 16 November 1995, the appellant essentially submits that that conclusion is vitiated by errors of law, if for no other reason than because the General Court did not address all its arguments. The General Court's observations in paragraph 189 et seq. of the judgment under appeal concerning the meeting on 23 April 1996, according to which it is immaterial that the discussion at issue was organised at the wholesalers' request, also err in law, since there is another, wholly legitimate, explanation of the practices complained of. That explanation is that the wholesalers in the bathroom fittings and fixtures sector expressly required annual price lists to be introduced on certain dates in order to be able to publish their catalogues. As regards the meeting on 15 October 1997, the General Court, in paragraph 194 of the judgment under appeal, also went beyond the limits of the review of legality for which Article 263 TFEU provides by relying on reasons which were not included in the Commission's statement of objections.</p>

            <p>So far as 1998 is concerned, the appellant submits that the General Court's observations, in paragraph 197 et seq. of the judgment under appeal, concerning Villeroy &amp; Boch Austria's alleged involvement in a cartel infringement also err in law as they are contradictory. The General Court observed, in paragraphs 197 to 202 of that judgment, that the Commission had failed to prove that Villeroy &amp; Boch Austria had participated, in 1998, in discussions that were contrary to competition law. In particular, Masco's statement was said not to prove such participation. It is illogical that the General Court should then rely, in paragraph 203 of the judgment under appeal, on the same statement of Masco to prove that Villeroy &amp; Boch did not distance itself from the unlawful practices in 1998. The General Court thus also failed to apply the legal principles developed in the case-law, whereby a set of indicia is sufficient to establish that a meeting is contrary to competition law only when it shows the systematic character of the meetings and their anticompetitive content and when that is supported by a statement of an undertaking that has significant probative value. In the appellant's submission, neither of those conditions is fulfilled in the present case.</p>

            <p>Concerning the year 1999, the appellant submits that there are errors of law in the General Court's conclusions in paragraph 208 of the judgment under appeal, according to which the evidence produced by the Commission, namely the handwritten notes of the ASI meeting on 6 September 1999 drawn up by Ideal Standard, establishes to the requisite legal standard the participation of Villeroy &amp; Boch in unlawful discussions. The statement of an undertaking which has applied for a reduction in its fine under the 2002 Leniency Notice cannot constitute sufficient evidence of an infringement where the accuracy of the statement is challenged by a number of other undertakings under investigation.</p>

            <p>Concerning the year 2000, the General Court, in paragraph 214 of the judgment under appeal, considered, relying on the minutes of the ASI meeting on 12 and 13 October 2000, that, despite the lack of direct evidence that Villeroy &amp; Boch Austria took part in the anticompetitive actions in that year, `it must be found that the unlawful discussions which took place in 1999 produced effects in the course of the year 2000'. The appellant maintains, however, that those minutes, which, moreover, were misinterpreted by the General Court, do not constitute sufficient evidence in that regard.</p>

In stating its reasons, the General Court merely referred to recitals 652 to 658 of the decision at issue, without explaining in what respect the explanations therein were persuasive.</p>

The General Court held, in that paragraph, that Villeroy &amp; Boch Austria, which did not attend the ASI meeting on 22 January 2004, was informed, by the minutes of the meeting, of the decisions taken by its competitors at the meeting, whilst, in paragraph 212 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court held that the fact that minutes of ASI meetings were as a rule to be sent to all the members of that association did not serve to establish, on its own, that Villeroy &amp; Boch Austria had actually acquainted itself with them.</p>

In fact, the General Court, in paragraphs 180 to 185 and 192 to 196 of the judgment under appeal, examined and rejected the appellant's arguments relating to the infringements in Austria so far as those various meetings are concerned. For each of them, the General Court referred to the relevant evidence and to the decision at issue before rejecting the appellant's arguments as unfounded. In doing so, the General Court stated reasons for the judgment under appeal.</p>

            <p>So far as the meeting on 15 October 1997 is concerned, the Court also rejects the appellant's argument that the General Court relied on reasons which were not included in the Commission's statement of objections. The General Court in fact relied, in paragraph 194 of the judgment under appeal, on the reasons set out in recitals 295 and 307 of the decision at issue. Villeroy &amp; Boch, however, did not allege, before the General Court, that there was any inconsistency between that decision and the statement of objections on this point. Consequently, in accordance with settled case-law (see, inter alia, judgment of 22 October 2015, AC-Treuhand v Commission, C‑194/14 P, EU:C:2015:717, paragraph 54), it cannot put forward such an argument at the stage of the appeal before the Court of Justice.</p>

            <p>Concerning, thirdly, the meetings of 30 April and 18 June 1998, it should be noted that the General Court found, in paragraph 199 of the judgment under appeal, that none of the evidence produced by the Commission established that Villeroy &amp; Boch had taken part in the infringement. However, in paragraph 203 of the judgment, the General Court clearly held that, in the absence of any `public distancing' on the part of Villeroy &amp; Boch and owing to the fact that the agreement of 15 October 1997 continued to produce anticompetitive effects throughout the following year, the Commission could consider that the appellant had not ceased to participate in the infringement in 1998. In proceeding in that way, the General Court fulfilled its obligation to state reasons, thereby enabling the parties to challenge its reasoning and the Court of Justice to exercise its power of review in the appeal. Having regard to the case-law set out in paragraph 111 of the present judgment, it did not make any error of law in its taking and appraisal of the evidence. Nor did the General Court contradict itself or fail in its obligation to state reasons in holding that, although Masco's statement did not, on its own, establish the participation of Villeroy &amp; Boch in exchanges of information in 1998, it could properly be taken into account, together with other material, as part of the set of consistent indicia described in paragraph 203 of the judgment under appeal in order to show that Villeroy &amp; Boch Austria did not interrupt its participation in the unlawful practices in 1998.</p>

            <p>As regards, fourthly, the meetings that took place in 1999, it should be noted that, as is made quite clear by paragraph 206 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission relied on a handwritten account of the meeting on 6 September 1999, drawn up by a representative of Ideal Standard on the actual day of the unlawful meeting. Contrary to the appellant's contention, such evidence, which does not date from the time when that company made an application under the 2002 Leniency Notice but which, as the General Court stated in paragraph 207 of the judgment under appeal, is contemporaneous with the facts, does not require there to be other corroborating evidence. That argument must therefore be rejected as unfounded.</p>

            <p>Concerning, fifthly, the ASI meeting on 12 and 13 October 2000, the appellant's arguments are based on a misreading of paragraph 214 of the judgment under appeal. Contrary to the appellant's claim, the General Court did not rely on the minutes of that meeting in finding that the unlawful discussions that took place in 1999 produced effects in the course of the year 2000. Furthermore, those arguments essentially seek to call in question the General Court's assessment of the evidence, without, however, proving that the clear sense of the evidence has been distorted. Accordingly, in view of the case-law set out in paragraph 38 of the present judgment, those arguments are inadmissible.</p>

Indeed, paragraphs 215 to 218 of that judgment make quite clear that the General Court did not base its finding that Villeroy &amp; Boch Austria had participated in the unlawful discussions that took place in 2001 on the ground that the discussions which took place in 2000 continued to produce effects the following year. In fact, in paragraphs 215 to 217 of that judgment, the General Court took as its basis the fact that that company had attended several meetings in 2001 at which the participants agreed on the date on which price lists would be sent to the wholesalers and on the date of the price increase, as well as on the fact that those meetings were coordinated with others that took place in 2000 and 2001, which Villeroy &amp; Boch Austria did not attend but at which ASI members mentioned figures for price increases from 1 January 2002.</p>

In view of the case-law set out in paragraph 72 of the present judgment, the General Court was not required to respond to each and every one of the appellant's submissions.

            <p>In that regard, the Court has made clear that, in the particular case in which a parent company holds, directly or indirectly, all or almost all of the capital in a subsidiary which has committed an infringement of the EU competition rules, there is a rebuttable presumption that that parent company actually exercises a decisive influence over its subsidiary (judgment of 16 June 2016, Evonik Degussa and AlzChem v Commission, C‑155/14 P, EU:C:2016:446, paragraph 28 and the case-law cited).</p>

The parent company then has the burden of rebutting the presumption, by adducing sufficient evidence relating to the organisational, economic and legal links between itself and its subsidiary to show that its subsidiary acts independently on the market. If the parent company fails to rebut the presumption, the Commission will be able to consider the parent and its subsidiary to form part of the same economic unit and to consider the parent to be responsible for the subsidiary's conduct and it will be able to hold the two companies jointly and severally liable for payment of a fine, without having to establish the personal involvement of the parent company in the infringement (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 June 2016, Evonik Degussa and AlzChem v Commission, C‑155/14 P, EU:C:2016:446, paragraphs 27 and 29 to 32 and the case-law cited).</p>

The presumption that a parent company exercises decisive influence over its subsidiary when it holds all or almost all of the capital in the subsidiary does not lead to a presumption of guilt on the part of either one of those companies and therefore does not infringe either the right to be presumed innocent or the principle of in dubio pro reo. As regards the principle of nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege, it requires that the law give a clear definition of offences and the penalties which they attract. That requirement is satisfied where the person concerned is in a position to ascertain from the wording of the relevant provision and, if need be, with the assistance of the courts' interpretation of it, what acts and omissions will make him criminally liable (judgment of 22 May 2008, Evonik Degussa v Commission, C‑266/06 P, not published, EU:C:2008:295, paragraph 39). The case-law of the Court of Justice set out in paragraphs 145 to 148 of the present judgment does not infringe that principle.</p>

            <p>As regards the fact that the fines were not divided up between the companies concerned, it should be recalled that, inasmuch as it is merely the manifestation of an ipso jure effect of the concept of an `undertaking', the EU law concept of joint and several liability for payment of a fine concerns only the undertaking itself and not the companies of which it is made up (judgment of 10 April 2014, Commission v Siemens Österreich and Others and Siemens Transmission &amp; Distribution and Others v Commission, C‑231/11 P to C‑233/11 P, EU:C:2014:256, paragraph 57).</p>

            <p>While it follows from Article 23(2) of Regulation No 1/2003 that the Commission is entitled to hold a number of companies jointly and severally liable for payment of a fine, in so far as they formed part of the same undertaking, it is not possible to conclude on the basis of either the wording of that provision or the objective of the joint and several liability mechanism that that power to impose penalties extends, beyond the determination of joint and several liability from an external perspective, to the power to determine the shares to be paid by those held jointly and severally liable from the perspective of their internal relationship (judgment of 10 April 2014, Commission v Siemens Österreich and Others and Siemens Transmission &amp; Distribution and Others v Commission, C‑231/11 P to C‑233/11 P, EU:C:2014:256, paragraph 58).</p>

            <p>On the contrary, the mechanism of joint and several liability is intended to constitute an additional legal device available to the Commission to strengthen the effectiveness of the action taken by it for the recovery of fines imposed for infringements of the competition rules, since that mechanism reduces for the Commission, as creditor of the debt represented by such fines, the risk of insolvency: that is part of the objective of deterrence pursued generally by competition law, as the General Court essentially observed, correctly, at paragraph 325 of the judgment under appeal (judgment of 10 April 2014, Commission v Siemens Österreich and Others and Siemens Transmission &amp; Distribution and Others v Commission, C‑231/11 P to C‑233/11 P, EU:C:2014:256, paragraph 59 and the case-law cited).</p>

That is a contentious issue, to be resolved at a later stage, and, in principle, the Commission no longer has any interest in the matter, where the fine has been paid in full by one or more of those held liable. Accordingly, the Commission cannot be required to determine such shares (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 April 2014, Commission v Siemens Österreich and Others and Siemens Transmission &amp; Distribution and Others v Commission, C‑231/11 P to C‑233/11 P, EU:C:2014:256, paragraphs 60 to 64).</p>

            <p>In the present case, Villeroy &amp; Boch does not deny that it owned, at the time of the infringement imputed to it, the entire share capital of the companies whose employees took part in the anticompetitive discussions in question in Belgium, France and Austria and does not claim that it submitted to the General Court any matters capable of rebutting the presumption that it exercised decisive influence over those companies. Accordingly, in view of the case-law set out in paragraphs 145 to 153 of the present judgment, the General Court was fully entitled to hold that the Commission could impute to Villeroy &amp; Boch the anticompetitive conduct of its subsidiaries in Belgium, France and Austria and hold it and those subsidiaries jointly and severally liable for the payment of fines, without determining the shares of those fines payable by each of them.</p>

            <p>Finally, Villeroy &amp; Boch's arguments alleging that the judgment under appeal is insufficiently reasoned must be rejected. Thus, as regards in particular whether it was possible for the Commission to hold Villeroy &amp; Boch answerable for the acts of its subsidiaries in France and Austria, paragraphs 155 to 165 of the judgment under appeal and paragraph 284 of the judgment, which refers to paragraphs 97 and 98 thereof, must be held to be sufficiently reasoned. After outlining the case-law concerning the concept of an `economic unit', the General Court stated that Villeroy &amp; Boch held all the share capital in its subsidiaries and that it had not sought to rebut the presumption that it exercised decisive influence over them. It then addressed Villeroy &amp; Boch's arguments alleging an infringement of the principle of nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege and of the right to be presumed innocent. As regards whether it was possible for the Commission to impute to Villeroy &amp; Boch the conduct of Villeroy &amp; Boch Belgium on the ground that it exercised a decisive influence over the latter, the General Court was not required to define its position on that point in the judgment under appeal since, contrary to what it maintains, Villeroy &amp; Boch did not dispute that that possibility existed.</p>

            <p>By its eighth ground of appeal Villeroy &amp; Boch maintains that the judgment under appeal under appeal infringes Article 101 TFEU and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement because the General Court erred in holding there to be a single, complex and continuous infringement in the present case.</p>

            <p>In that regard, Villeroy &amp; Boch submits, in the first place, that the legal concept of a single, complex and continuous infringement is, in itself, incompatible with Article 101 TFEU and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement and therefore cannot be applied.

            <p>In the second place, Villeroy &amp; Boch maintains that, in finding there to be a single infringement in the present case, the judgment under appeal breached the principles of due process. Since the General Court held that unlawful conduct in which Villeroy &amp; Boch did not participate, but which forms part of a single infringement in which it did take part, may be imputed to it, Villeroy &amp; Boch is unable, for the purpose of disputing its participation in that single infringement, to construct a successful argument on the basis of the fact that it did not take part in the first-mentioned unlawful conduct and is therefore denied an effective ground of defence. Thus, the only point it may dispute is that it was aware of the infringement in question.</p>

            <p>In the third place, Villeroy &amp; Boch argues, in the alternative, that the conditions for the recognition of a single infringement were not met in the present case since the Commission did not define the relevant market and since it has not been established that there was a relationship of complementarity between the various acts complained of.</p>

            <p>In the fourth place, Villeroy &amp; Boch considers that, in any event, because the decision at issue was annulled in part with regard to certain Member States by the judgments of 16 September 2013, Wabco Europe and Others v Commission ( T‑380/10, EU:T:2013:449); of 16 September 2013, Keramag Keramische Werke and Others v Commission ( T‑379/10 and T‑381/10, not published, EU:T:2013:457); and of 16 September 2013, Duravit and Others v Commission ( T‑364/10, not published, EU:T:2013:477), and because certain undertakings may not have been aware of the entirety of the infringement, there cannot have been an overall infringement as defined in that decision.</p>

            <p>In view of the case-law set out in paragraphs 55 to 59 of the present judgment, the Court must, first, reject the appellant's arguments that the legal concept of a single, complex and continuous infringement is incompatible with Article 101 TFEU and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement and breaches the principles of due process, leaving aside the question of the admissibility of the latter argument.</p>

            <p>Secondly, the Court finds that, contrary to the appellant's contention, the General Court, in setting out that case-law in paragraphs 32 to 34, 41, 42 and 46 to 48 of the judgment under appeal, gave a sufficient statement of its reasons.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, as regards the appellant's argument that the conditions for the recognition of a single infringement were not met in the present case since the Commission did not define the relevant market, it must be noted, as the General Court correctly stated in paragraph 54 of the judgment under appeal and as the appellant accepts, that the fact that the infringement extended over distinct product and geographic markets does not in any event preclude the finding of a single infringement. Thus, this argument is in any event ineffective.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, the General Court, in paragraphs 63 to 71 of the judgment under appeal, did not err in law in holding that the Commission could in the present case find there to be a single objective tending to establish a single infringement. Indeed, the General Court, on the basis of the findings of fact made in paragraphs 66, 69 and 71 of the judgment under appeal, established to the requisite legal standard that the various instances of conduct complained of pursued the same goal, namely, as regards all the bathroom fittings and fixtures manufacturers, coordinating their conduct in relation to the wholesalers. In that regard, attention should be drawn to the fact that, contrary to what is maintained by the appellant, the concept of a common objective was defined -- as is clear from paragraphs 66, 69 and 71 of the judgment under appeal -- not by a general reference to a distortion of competition on the markets concerned by the infringement, but rather by reference to various objective factors, such as the central role played by the wholesalers in the distribution chain, the features of that chain, the existence of umbrella associations and cross-product associations, the similarities in the way the collusive arrangements were implemented and the material, geographic and temporal overlap between the practices concerned.</p>

            <p>There is in those circumstances no need to establish a link of complementarity between the practices complained of, given that a single and continuous infringement may be imputed to undertakings that are not in competition and does not require the relevant markets to be systematically defined. Moreover, in view of the fact that the appellant is</p>
            <blockList>
              <item>

                <p>liable for its indirect participation in that infringement since it was aware of all the offending conduct planned or implemented by the other cartel members in pursuit of the same objectives or could reasonably have foreseen that conduct and was prepared to take the risk, the General Court cannot be criticised for holding that the Commission did not make an error in concluding that there was a single and continuous infringement in the present case.</p>

            <p>Finally, as regards the arguments relating to the fact that, in other cases concerning the present cartel, the decision at issue was annulled in part, it should be recalled that the assessment of the evidence concerning the various national markets falls within the exclusive jurisdiction of the General Court. In so far as these arguments seek to call into question the existence of a single, complex and continuous infringement, it should be made clear, as has been stated in paragraph 62 of the present judgment, that the fact that the General Court partially annulled the decision at issue in so far as it concerns the participation in the alleged infringement of certain of the undertakings concerned on certain geographic markets for given periods of time is not sufficient to cast doubt on the General Court's finding as to the existence of</p>

In that regard, it is impossible to understand the reasons why the Commission penalised the misconduct complained of in the present case more severely than similar cartels covering the whole of the European Economic Area. In addition, the General Court should have granted Villeroy &amp; Boch a reduction in its fine for breach of the principle that the procedure must be concluded within a reasonable time ( `the reasonable time principle'), owing to the excessive duration of the administrative procedure, which went on for almost six years in total.</p>

            <p>In order to satisfy the requirements of Article 47 of the Charter when conducting a review in the exercise of its unlimited jurisdiction with regard to the fine, the EU judicature is bound, in the exercise of the powers conferred by Articles 261 and 263 TFEU, to examine all complaints based on issues of fact and law which seek to show that the amount of the fine is not commensurate with the gravity or the duration of the infringement (see judgment of 18 December 2014, Commission v Parker Hannifin Manufacturing and Parker-Hannifin, C‑434/13 P, EU:C:2014:2456, paragraph 75 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>However, the exercise of unlimited jurisdiction is not equivalent to an own-motion review, and proceedings are inter partes. It is, in principle, for the applicant to raise pleas in law against the contested decision and to adduce evidence in support of those pleas (see judgment of 18 December 2014, Commission v Parker Hannifin Manufacturing and Parker-Hannifin, C‑434/13 P, EU:C:2014:2456, paragraph 76 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It should be noted in that regard that the absence of an own-motion review of the whole of the contested decision does not contravene the principle of effective judicial protection. Compliance with that principle does not require that the General Court -- which is indeed obliged to respond to the pleas in law raised and to carry out a review of both the law and the facts -- should be obliged to undertake of its own motion a new and comprehensive investigation of the file (see judgment of 8 December 2011, Chalkor v Commission, C‑386/10 P, EU:C:2011:815, paragraph 66).</p>

            <p>Moreover, according to settled case-law of the Court of Justice, the General Court alone has jurisdiction to examine how in each particular case the Commission assessed the gravity of unlawful conduct. In an appeal, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, first, to examine to what extent the General Court took into consideration, in a legally correct manner, all the essential factors to assess the gravity of particular conduct in the light of Article 101 TFEU and Article 23 of Regulation No 1/2003 and, second, to consider whether the General Court responded to a sufficient legal standard to all the arguments raised in support of the claim for reduction of the fine. The gravity of infringements of EU competition law must be determined by reference to numerous factors such as, in particular, the deterrent effect of fines, the specific circumstances and context of the case, including the conduct of each of the undertakings, the role played by each of them in the establishment of the cartel, the profit which they were able to derive from it, their size, the value of the goods concerned and the threat that infringements of that type pose to the objectives of the European Union (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 July 2013, Team Relocations and Others v Commission, C‑444/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:464, paragraphs 95, 99 and 100).</p>

            <p>Moreover, it is not for the Court of Justice, when ruling on questions of law in the context of an appeal, to substitute, on grounds of fairness, its own assessment for that of the General Court exercising its unlimited jurisdiction to rule on the amount of fines imposed on undertakings for their infringement of EU law. Accordingly, only where the Court of Justice considers that the level of the penalty is not merely inappropriate, but also excessive to the point of being disproportionate, does it have to find that the General Court erred in law, on account of the inappropriateness of the amount of a fine (see, inter alia, judgment of 30 May 2013, Quinn Barlo and Others v Commission, C‑70/12 P, not published, EU:C:2013:351, paragraph 57 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It is clear from that case-law that, first, a review in the exercise of unlimited jurisdiction concerns solely the penalty imposed and not the entirety of the contested decision and, second, neither the exercise of unlimited jurisdiction nor the review of legality are equivalent to an own-motion review and they therefore do not require the General Court to undertake of its own motion a new and comprehensive investigation of the file, independently of the claims put forward by the applicant.</p>

            <p>In the present case, it must be found that the General Court did in fact carry out, in paragraph 335 et seq. of the judgment under appeal, a review of the amount of the fine, that it responded to Villeroy &amp; Boch's various arguments and that, in paragraphs 397 to 402 of the judgment, it ruled on the claims for reduction of the fine; it therefore did not confine itself to merely reviewing the legality of that amount, contrary to what is maintained by the appellant. In that connection, the General Court stated in particular, in paragraph 384 of the judgment under appeal, that the multiplier of 15% in respect of the multipliers for `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount' was the lowest possible in view of the particularly serious nature of the infringement at issue, then held, in paragraphs 397 to 401 of the judgment, that none of the matters put forward by the applicants at first instance justified a reduction of the fine.</p>

            <p>Concerning more particularly the examination of the gravity of the alleged infringement, it should be noted that the General Court referred, in paragraph 381 of the judgment under appeal, in particular to point 23 of the 2006 Guidelines, which states that `horizontal price-fixing, market-sharing and output-limitation agreements, which are usually secret, are, by their very nature, among the most harmful restrictions of competition. As a matter of policy, they will be heavily fined. Therefore, the proportion of the value of sales taken into account for such infringements will generally be set at the higher end of the scale'. The General Court set out, in paragraph 383 of the judgment under appeal, the reasoning adopted by the Commission in recital 1211 of the decision at issue, which stated that horizontal price coordination was, owing to its very nature, one of the most harmful restrictions of competition and that the infringement was a single, continuous and complex infringement covering six Member States and concerning the three product sub-groups. The General Court went on to make findings</p>

            <p>In thus taking account of all the relevant criteria for assessing the gravity of the infringement in question (horizontal price coordination and Villeroy &amp; Boch's involvement in it also being proven) and in responding to the latter's arguments on that point, the General Court did not make an error of law and fulfilled its obligation to carry out an effective judicial review of the decision at issue.</p>

            <p>Concerning the assessment of the excessive duration of the administrative procedure, it should be recalled that, although an infringement by the Commission of the reasonable time principle can justify the annulment of a decision taken by it following an administrative procedure based on Article 101 or 102 TFEU inasmuch as it also entails an infringement of the rights of defence of the undertaking concerned, such an infringement of the reasonable time principle, if established, cannot lead to a reduction of the fine imposed (see, inter alia, judgments of 9 June 2016, CEPSA v Commission, C‑608/13 P, EU:C:2016:414, paragraph 61, and of 9 June 2016, PROAS v Commission, C‑616/13 P, EU:C:2016:415, paragraph 74 and the case-law cited). In the present case, as follows from paragraph 173 of the present judgment, it is clear that, with its argument that the General Court's assessment of the excessive duration of the administrative procedure was incorrect, the appellant is seeking solely a reduction of the fine imposed on it.</p>

            <p>Finally, as regards the proportionality of the fine imposed, the appellant has put forward no argument capable of demonstrating that the level of the fine imposed is inappropriate or excessive. In that regard, the Court rejects the argument that a fine of EUR 71.5 million is disproportionate in relation to the turnover concerned by the cartel (EUR 115 million). It is not disputed that, in the present case, the final amount of the fine imposed was reduced so as not to exceed 10% of the appellant's total turnover in the preceding business year, in accordance with Article 23(2) of Regulation No 1/2003. That limit is already a guarantee that the fine is not disproportionate to the size of the undertaking, determined by reference to its worldwide turnover (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 June 2005, Dansk Rørindustri and Others v Commission, C‑189/02 P, C‑202/02 P, C‑205/02 P to C‑208/02 P and C‑213/02, EU:C:2005:408, paragraphs 280 to 282).</p>
