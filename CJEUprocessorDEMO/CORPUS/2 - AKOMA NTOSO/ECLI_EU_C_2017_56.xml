            <p>Roca Sanitario is the parent company of a group of companies active in the bathroom fittings and fixtures sector ( `the Roca group'). At the time of the events constituting the infringement found, Roca Sanitario held all the share capital of Roca, whose core business was the distribution of ceramic ware and taps and fittings on the French market. On 29 October 1999 Roca Sanitario acquired the group whose ultimate parent was Keramik Holding AG ( `the Laufen group'), a company governed by Swiss law which held, inter alia, all the share capital of Laufen Austria AG. At the time of the events constituting the infringement found, Laufen Austria manufactured ceramic sanitary ware under its own brands and marketed those products as well as products manufactured by its competitors. Its sales were concentrated in Austria and, to a lesser extent, Germany.</p>

That infringement, in which 17 undertakings had allegedly participated, was said to have taken place over various periods between 16 October 1992 and 9 November 2004 and to have taken the form of anticompetitive agreements or concerted practices covering the territory of Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria. According to the decision at issue, the products covered by the cartel were bathroom fittings and fixtures belonging to the following three product sub-groups: taps and fittings, shower enclosures and accessories, and ceramic sanitary ware (ceramics) ( `the three product sub-groups').</p>

            <p>Roca Sanitario puts forward two grounds in support of its appeal. The first ground of appeal alleges that the General Court erred in law in holding that one of its pleas raised at first instance was put forward `out of time'. The second alleges that the General Court, in refusing to reduce the basic amount of the fine imposed on Roca Sanitario, infringed the principle that penalties must be specific to the offender, the principles of personal responsibility, proportionality, equal treatment and protection of legitimate expectations and the obligation to state reasons.</p>

            <p>By its first ground of appeal, Roca Sanitario complains that the General Court, in paragraphs 44 and 45 of the judgment under appeal, rejected as inadmissible its argument that the Commission, in applying the presumption that Roca Sanitario exercised decisive influence over Laufen Austria, took into account an incorrect date so far as Roca Sanitario's acquisition of virtually all the shares in Keramik Holding was concerned. It maintains that, contrary to what is stated in the decision at issue, that acquisition did not take place until 31 December 1999.</p>

            <p>The appellant submits that the General Court, incorrectly, held that argument to be out of time on the ground that it had been put forward for the first time at the stage of the reply. In its submission, that argument should have been regarded as expanding upon a plea that had already been set out in the application. In any event, the General Court is obliged to raise of its own motion at any stage of the proceedings an error in the assessment of the facts and to reduce the fine accordingly, if the right to effective judicial protection enshrined in Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and the principle of proportionality underpinning Article 31 of Regulation No 1/2003 are not to be infringed.</p>

            <p>It should be recalled that the Courts of the European Union must carry out the review of legality incumbent upon them on the basis of the evidence adduced by the applicant in support of the pleas in law put forward. In carrying out such a review, the Courts cannot use the Commission's margin of discretion -- either as regards the choice of factors taken into account in the application of the criteria mentioned in the guidelines or as regards the assessment of those factors -- as a basis for dispensing with the conduct of an in-depth review of the law and of the facts (judgment of 8 December 2011, Chalkor v Commission, C‑386/10 P, EU:C:2011:815, paragraph 62).</p>

            <p>The review of legality is supplemented by the unlimited jurisdiction which is recognised by Article 31 of Regulation No 1/2003, in accordance with Article 261 TFEU. That jurisdiction empowers the Courts, in addition to carrying out a mere review of legality with regard to the penalty, to substitute their own appraisal for the Commission's and, consequently, to cancel, reduce or increase the fine or penalty payment imposed (judgment of 8 December 2011, Chalkor v Commission, C‑386/10 P, EU:C:2011:815, paragraph 63 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It must, however, be pointed out that the exercise of unlimited jurisdiction is not equivalent to an own-motion review and that proceedings before the Courts of the European Union are inter partes. With the exception of grounds involving matters of public policy which the Courts are required to raise of their own motion, such as the failure to state reasons for a contested decision, it is for the applicant to raise pleas in law against that decision and to adduce evidence in support of those pleas (judgment of 8 December 2011, Chalkor v Commission, C‑386/10 P, EU:C:2011:815, paragraph 64).</p>

An argument which does not expand upon an argument raised previously, whether directly or by implication, in the original application and which is not closely connected with that previous argument must be regarded as a new plea (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 November 2009, SGL Carbon v Commission, C‑564/08 P, not published, EU:C:2009:703, paragraphs 20 to 34, and of 16 December 2010, AceaElectrabel Produzione v Commission, C‑480/09 P, EU:C:2010:787, paragraph 111).</p>

It then observed, in paragraph 45 of the judgment, that `the applicant expressly stated, in the application, that it had acquired 100% of the share capital of Keramik Holding on 29 October 1999' and concluded that `it is therefore incorrect of the applicant to maintain that [this] claim is to be regarded as expanding upon submissions made in the application'.</p>

            <p>Roca Sanitario submits, in the first place, that paragraphs 157 to 188 of the judgment under appeal are vitiated by an error of law in that they take no account, in the determination of the amount of the fine, of the fact that the participation in the infringement, liability for which was imputed to it, was of lesser gravity than that of the other undertakings penalised. Roca Sanitario argues in this respect that the judgment under appeal drew no distinction -- other than with regard to the geographic extent of the involvement of the participants in the infringement -- between the gravity of the conduct of its subsidiaries and the gravity of the conduct of the undertakings making up the `hard core' of participating undertakings, in order to reflect the nature of their respective actions and the number of product sub-groups covered by the infringement. In accordance with the principle of non-discrimination, the General Court should have reduced the basic amount of the fine imposed on Roca Sanitario, applying lower multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount' than those applied to those core undertakings and should have acted upon the findings it made in paragraphs 169, 186 and 187 of the judgment under appeal.</p>

            <p>In the second place, Roca Sanitario maintains that the grounds stated in paragraphs 168 and 187 of the judgment under appeal conflict with the case-law precedents in the matter of the gradation of fines and unduly favour the principle of proportionality of the fine to the detriment of the principle of equal treatment.</p>

            <p>In the third place, Roca Sanitario submits that the lesser gravity of the participation in the infringement, liability for which was imputed to it, should have been taken into account as a mitigating circumstance for the purposes of the third indent of point 29 of the 2006 Guidelines. However, in paragraphs 171 to 177 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court, on the basis of an over-restrictive and incorrect interpretation of that provision, did not allow any reduction of the fine in this regard.</p>

            <p>In the fourth place, the General Court infringed the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations and failed in its obligation to state reasons inasmuch as, whilst relying on points 21 to 23 of the 2006 Guidelines in paragraph 185 of the judgment under appeal, it failed to take into account that the participation in the infringement, liability for which was imputed to Roca Sanitario, was of lesser gravity than that of other participants and held that the Commission had acted in accordance with the principle of proportionality.</p>

            <p>The Commission disputes those arguments. Furthermore, whilst it considers that the General Court was correct in rejecting Roca Sanitario's arguments concerning infringement of the principles of equal treatment and proportionality, it submits, in essence, that the General Court accepted an incorrect premiss, namely that the multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount' applied to Roca Sanitario, which participated in the infringement only with regard to France and Austria, should have been different from those used for other cartel members which had participated in the infringement in six Member States and in relation to three product sub-groups.

                <p>that the undertakings that participated in the first-mentioned infringement should, for that reason alone, be subject to a fine calculated on the basis of higher multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount' than those applied to the appellant.</p>

            <p>As regards the determination of the multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount', it is apparent from points 22 and 25 of the 2006 Guidelines that account must be taken of a number of factors, in particular those set out in point 22 of the guidelines. Although, in order to assess the gravity of an infringement and subsequently set the fine to be imposed, account may be taken, inter alia, of the geographic extent of an infringement, the fact that the geographic scope of one infringement is more extensive than that of another does not, on its own, necessarily mean that the first infringement, considered as a whole, and in particular in the light of its nature, must be classified as more serious than the second and as therefore justifying the setting of higher multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount' than those used in the calculation of the fine for the second infringement (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 July 2014, Telefónica and Telefónica de España v Commission, C‑295/12 P, EU:C:2014:2062, paragraph 178).</p>

            <p>It must nonetheless be recalled that the principle of equal treatment is a general principle of EU law enshrined in Articles 20 and 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. According to settled case-law, that principle requires that comparable situations must not be treated differently and different situations must not be treated in the same way unless such treatment is objectively justified (see, inter alia, judgment of 12 November 2014, Guardian Industries and Guardian Europe v Commission, C‑580/12 P, EU:C:2014:2363, paragraph 51).</p>

            <p>Observance of that principle is binding on the General Court not only in the exercise of its review of the legality of the Commission's decision imposing fines but also in the exercise of its unlimited jurisdiction. When the amount of the fines imposed is determined, the exercise of such jurisdiction cannot result in discrimination between undertakings which have participated in an agreement or concerted practice contrary to Article 101(1) TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 18 December 2014, Commission v Parker Hannifin Manufacturing and Parker-Hannifin, C‑434/13 P, EU:C:2014:2456, paragraph 77).</p>

            <p>It follows from the case-law of the Court of Justice, however, that the taking into account, by virtue of the principle of equal treatment, of differences between the undertakings that have participated in a single cartel (in particular with regard to the geographic scope of their respective involvement) for the purpose of assessing the gravity of an infringement need not necessarily occur when the multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount' are set but may occur at another stage in the setting of the fine, such as when the basic amount of the fine is adjusted in the light of mitigating and aggravating circumstances under points 28 and 29 of the 2006 Guidelines (see, to that effect, judgments of 11 July 2013, Gosselin Group v Commission, C‑429/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:463, paragraphs 96 to 100, and of 11 July 2013, Team Relocations and Others v Commission, C‑444/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:464, paragraphs 104 and 105).</p>

          <content eId="para_13573__content">
            <p>As the Commission has observed, such differences may also be reflected by means of the value of sales that is used in calculating the basic amount of the fine inasmuch as that value reflects, for each participating undertaking, the scale of its involvement in the infringement in question, in accordance with point 13 of the 2006 Guidelines, under which it is possible to take as a starting point for the calculation of the fines an amount which reflects the economic significance of the infringement and the size of the undertaking's contribution to it (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 July 2013, Team Relocations and Others v Commission, C‑444/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:464, paragraph 76).</p>

            <p>Consequently, since it is not disputed that the basic amount of the fines imposed on Roca Sanitario was determined by reference to the value of the sales made by Laufen Austria in Austria and by Roca in France, the General Court could, in paragraphs 168 and 169 and paragraphs 186 and 187 of the judgment under appeal, set the multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount' at 15% of that value without infringing the principle of equal treatment.</p>

            <p>Although it follows from the foregoing that the reasoning of the General Court in paragraphs 168 and 169 and paragraphs 186 and 187 of the judgment under appeal is vitiated by errors of law, it must be recalled that, if the grounds of a decision of the General Court disclose an infringement of EU law but its operative part is shown to be well founded on other legal grounds, such an infringement is not one that should cause that decision to be set aside, and a substitution of grounds must be made (see, to that effect, judgments of 9 June 1992, Lestelle v Commission, C‑30/91 P, EU:C:1992:252, paragraph 28, and of 9 September 2008, FIAMM and Others v Council and Commission, C‑120/06 P and C‑121/06 P, EU:C:2008:476, paragraph 187 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>The second ground of appeal must therefore be rejected in so far as it complains that the General Court made errors of law and, in particular, infringed the principles of proportionality and equal treatment in that, since the General Court failed to apply to Roca Sanitario multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount' that were lower than those applied to undertakings whose conduct in the infringement was the most serious, account was not taken, in the judgment under appeal, of the lesser gravity of the participation in the infringement for which liability was imputed to Roca Sanitario.</p>

            <p>As regards the claim that the General Court failed in its obligation to state reasons and infringed the principle of the protection of legitimate expectations in holding, in paragraph 185 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had acted in accordance with the principle of proportionality, it must be noted that the General Court described the method for calculating the amount of the fine in general terms, in paragraphs 148 and 149 of the judgment under appeal, and, in paragraphs 150 to 152 of the judgment, described how the Commission had applied that method in the present case.</p>
