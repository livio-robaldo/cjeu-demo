            <p>However, Paragraph 10(2), point 1, of the EStG 2002 makes the deduction of expenses under the heading of special expenses subject to the condition that they have no direct economic link with tax-exempt income. Since Mrs Bechtel's remuneration is tax-exempt in Germany, that direct economic link has been established and the deduction of provident expenses as special expenses is not possible, irrespective of whether, for the years 2005 and 2006, the ceiling for the deduction of the special expenses laid down in Paragraph 10(3) of the EStG 2002 was reached without her provident expenses, something which the contested decisions do not mention.</p>

According to that court, the refusal to grant to the resident taxpayer the right either to deduct from the basis of assessment in Germany the amount of social security contributions paid in another Member State or to reduce the tax payable in Germany by the amount of social security contributions paid in another Member State may deter that taxpayer from exercising the right to free movement of workers, and so may constitute an unjustified restriction on that fundamental freedom.</p>

However, taking account of the fundamental nature, in the scheme of the Treaty, of the principles of freedom of movement and equality of treatment of workers within the European Union, the exceptions made by that provision cannot have a scope going beyond the aim in view of which that derogation was included (judgments of 12 February 1974, Sotgiu, 152/73, EU:C:1974:13, paragraph 4, and of 26 April 2007, Alevizos, C‑392/05, EU:C:2007:251, paragraph 69).</p>

            <p>Secondly, if the provisions of Paragraph 10(2), point 1, of the EStG 2002 made it possible take into account the social security contributions paid in France for the calculation of the taxable income in Germany, they would be contrary to the principle of the cohesion of tax systems, in that, although the exempt income paid in France is not taken into account in the calculation of the basis of assessment, Mrs Bechtel could still deduct the provident expenses when being taxed jointly with her spouse. The increased tax rate in the context of the spouses' maintenance of progressivity would be corrected through the deduction of expenses when the taxable income is calculated. In addition, the advantage arising from the deduction of insurance contributions would have a direct link with the taxation of the corresponding income and, in the present case, if Mrs Bechtel were to be denied the theoretical advantage of deducting those insurance contributions, she would obtain the advantage of her French income not being taxed in Germany.</p>

As far as concerns the exercise of the power of taxation so allocated by bilateral conventions to prevent double taxation, the Member States must comply with EU rules (see, to that effect, judgments of 12 December 2002, de Groot, C‑385/00, EU:C:2002:750, paragraphs 93 and 94; of 19 January 2006, Bouanich, C‑265/04, EU:C:2006:51, paragraphs 49 and 50, and of 12 December 2013, Imfeld and Garcet, C‑303/12, EU:C:2013:822, paragraphs 41 and 42).</p>

            <p>In the present case, the issue of the allocation of powers to impose taxes between the French Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany was dealt with in the Franco-German Convention, according to which, first of all, salaries, wages and similar remuneration, paid by one of the Contracting States, by a Land or by a legal person of that State or Land governed by public law to natural persons resident in the other State in consideration for present or past administrative services is to be taxable only in the first State. Next, that convention provides that income originating in France which, by virtue of that convention, is taxable in that Member State, received by residents of the Federal Republic of Germany, is to be excluded from the German basis of assessment, without that rule limiting the right of the Federal Republic of Germany to take into account, when determining the rate of its taxes, the income thus excluded. Finally, the convention does not impose an obligation for the State which is the source of the income to take full account of the personal and family circumstances of taxpayers carrying on their economic activity in that Member State and residing in the other Member State.</p>

            <p>In the present case, the German Government's argument seeks to demonstrate, first, that the aim of the refusal to deduct special expenses is to ensure that the increased tax rate in the spouses' maintenance of progressivity is not corrected by reducing taxable income, and secondly, that the advantage resulting from the deduction of the contributions would be offset by the taxation of income which has a direct link with those contributions.</p>

The effectiveness of the progressivity of the income tax in the Member State of residence, sought by the method of exemption with maintenance of progressivity, is not conditional upon the consideration given to the personal and family circumstances of the taxpayer being limited to expenses connected with income taxed in that Member State (see, by analogy, judgment of 12 December 2002, de Groot, C‑385/00, EU:C:2002:750, paragraph 109).</p>
