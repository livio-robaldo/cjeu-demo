            <p>Consequently, on 13 March 2012, the CNRSI notified Lubrizol of a revised assessment, followed by a letter of formal notice. Lubrizol contested the claim that it owed the amounts sought, submitting that the value of the goods that it had transferred to other EU Member States did not come within the basis of assessment for the contributions at issue which it had to pay for the year 2008. According to it, at the date of those transfers, it was still the owner of those goods and had not yet transferred them to its customers, with the result that those transfers did not constitute a sale and thus part of its turnover.</p>

            <p>Having been unsuccessful at first instance and on appeal, Lubrizol brought an appeal before the Cour de cassation (Court of Cassation) (France), claiming that, contrary to the finding of the appeal court, the contributions at issue had to be regarded as charges having equivalent effect, since transfers of goods to another Member State are included in the basis of assessment for those contributions, unlike transfers of goods within the national territory or to a third country.</p>

            <p>The Cour de cassation observes, furthermore, that the additional contribution to the C3S was introduced by Law No 2004-810 of 13 August 2004 and that its proceeds were essentially allocated, during 2008, to the National Sickness Insurance Fund for employees, and then to the Old-Age Solidarity Fund.</p>

            <p>According to the referring court, the basis of assessment for those two contributions, which are, as defined by national law, charges of any kind, consists of the overall turnover before tax declared to the tax authorities.

Such a transfer must be included in the taxable person's declaration to the tax authorities, whilst being exempt from VAT under Article 262b of the GTC.</p>

            <p>In that context, the referring court has previously held that the representative value of stock transferred by an undertaking from France to another EU Member State is included in the basis of assessment for the contributions at issue, even if that transfer does not in itself generate any turnover. By contrast, transfers within the national territory and those made to a third country are not to be treated as a supply of goods, with the result that their representative value is not included in the basis of assessment for the contributions at issue.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the Cour de cassation decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling: `Is it contrary to Articles 28 [TFEU] and 30 [TFEU] for the value of goods transferred from France to another Member State of the European Union by or on behalf of an entity subject to [the contributions at issue], for the purposes of its business, to be taken into account in determining the overall turnover that constitutes the basis of assessment for those contributions?'</p>

          <content eId="para_13859__content">
            <p>By its question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Articles 28 and 30 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding legislation of a Member State which provides that the basis of assessment for contributions levied on the annual turnover of companies, to the extent to which that turnover reaches or exceeds a certain amount, is calculated by taking into account the representative value of the goods transferred by or on behalf of a taxable person, for the purposes of his business, from that Member State to another EU Member State, that value being taken into account from the time of that transfer, whereas, in the case where the same goods are transferred by or on behalf of the taxable person, for the purposes of his business, within the territory of the Member State concerned, their value is not taken into account in the basis of assessment until their subsequent sale.</p>

          <content eId="para_13860__content">
            <p>According to the applicable national law, in the case in the main proceedings, the contributions at issue are levied on the annual turnover of companies, on condition that, for the tax year concerned, that turnover amounts to at least EUR 760000. It also follows from that national law that a transfer of goods made by a taxable person subject to those contributions, or on his behalf, for the purposes of his business, from France to another EU Member State, is to be considered, for the purposes of the levying of those contributions, to be a supply of goods and incorporated in the turnover of the company concerned.</p>

          <content eId="para_13861__content">
            <p>The referring court observes, in particular, that the representative value of goods which are merely transferred, without loss of ownership, to another EU Member State is incorporated in the basis of assessment for the contributions at issue, whereas that is not the case when such a transfer takes place within French territory. In the case of transfers made within French territory, it is only at the date of the sale of the goods concerned that their value is included in the turnover of the company in question and incorporated in the basis of assessment for the contributions at issue. The referring court is therefore uncertain, having regard to the manner in which the basis of assessment for those contributions is calculated, whether those contributions constitute charges having equivalent effect to customs duties on exports, contrary to Articles 28 and 30 TFEU.</p>

            <p>According to settled case-law of the Court, any pecuniary charge, however small and whatever its designation and mode of application, which is imposed unilaterally on goods by reason of the fact that they cross a frontier, and which is not a customs duty in the strict sense, constitutes a charge having equivalent effect to a customs duty. By contrast, pecuniary charges resulting from a general system of internal taxation applied systematically, in accordance with the same objective criteria, to categories of products irrespective of their origin or destination fall within Article 110 TFEU, which prohibits discriminatory internal taxation (judgment of 1 March 2018, Petrotel-Lukoil and Georgescu, C‑76/17, EU:C:2018:139, paragraph 21 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be borne in mind that the FEU Treaty provisions relating to charges having equivalent effect and those relating to discriminatory internal taxation cannot be applied together, with the result that under the system of the Treaty the same measure cannot belong to both categories at the same time (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 October 2014, Orgacom, C‑254/13, EU:C:2014:2251, paragraph 20 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be recalled that, in the context of the interpretation of Article 110 TFEU, the Court has held that a charge which is not imposed on goods as such must nevertheless be regarded as being imposed on a product when it has an immediate effect on the cost of the product in question (judgments of 16 February 1977, Schöttle, 20/76, EU:C:1977:26, paragraph 15, and of 8 November 2007, Stadtgemeinde Frohnleiten and Gemeindebetriebe Frohnleiten, C‑221/06, EU:C:2007:657, paragraph 43).

            <p>However, where the annual turnover of those companies reaches an amount of at least EUR 760000, the whole of that turnover constitutes the basis of assessment for the levies at issue, the rate of which is set at 0.13% and 0.03%, respectively, of that turnover. In so far as that turnover is generated by the sale of goods in France and the transfer of goods to another Member State, the contributions at issue are imposed on those goods themselves, although they are levied not on the date of their sale or transfer to another Member State, but overall and yearly.</p>

That ruling specifically concerned the common system of VAT and, in particular, the abovementioned Article 33, the purpose of which is to prevent the functioning of that system from being jeopardised by a Member State's fiscal measures affecting the movement of goods and services and being imposed on transactions in a manner comparable to VAT.</p>

In such a situation, those contributions, in so far as they are calculated taking into account the sale price of those goods, should also be regarded as charges having equivalent effect (see, to that effect, judgment of 17 September 1997, Fricarnes, C‑28/96, EU:C:1997:412, point 28).</p>
