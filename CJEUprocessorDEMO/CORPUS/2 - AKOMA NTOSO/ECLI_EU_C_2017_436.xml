Such an application may be made either by the Ministry of Justice -- who is, in Greece, the central authority responsible for applications for return -- or directly by the person, institution or body claiming rights of custody with respect to the child.

By a judgment of 7 November 2016, that court held that it had no jurisdiction to hear the claims relating to parental responsibility with respect to the child, on the ground that the child has been resident, since her birth, in a Member State other than Italy. An appeal having been brought by OL, that judgment was upheld on 20 January 2017 by the Corte d'appello di Ancona (Ancona court of appeal, Italy). Further, by a judgment of 23 January 2017, the Tribunale ordinario di Ancona (court of Ancona) declined to hear the maintenance allowance application, again on the ground that the child was not habitually resident in Italy. Finally, on 23 February 2017, that court ordered the divorce of OL and PQ, but made no ruling on parental responsibility with respect to the child.</p>

            <p>The referring court considers that a child's physical presence in a given place should not therefore be a prerequisite for the child being assessed as `habitually resident' there, for the purposes of Article 11 of Regulation No 2201/2003. As regards quite specifically newborn children and infants, the factors which ordinarily facilitate determination of habitual residence are, in the view of the referring court, of no relevance because young children are absolutely dependant on those who look after them. The Court has itself held that the condition as to the physical presence of a child is of less importance with respect to infants, since the Court held, in the judgment of 22 December 2010, Mercredi ( C‑497/10 PPU, EU:C:2010:829), that if such an infant was resident for a few days in a given place, that, allied to other factors, was sufficient ground to establish that the child was habitually resident there.</p>

It is also plain that the child was not, thereafter, `removed to a third State'. Further, although the referring court refers, in its question, both to `newborn children' and `infants', it has to be said that, given that immediately before the alleged retention, namely in June 2016, the child was already five months old, this case concerns an infant.</p>

Against that background, the referring court asks whether, in such a situation, the initial intention of the parents that the mother would return with the child to the latter Member State is a factor of crucial importance for the decision whether that child was `habitually resident' there, within the meaning of that regulation, irrespective of the fact that the child has never been physically present in that Member State.</p>

Consequently, where, as in the main proceedings, an infant is in fact taken care of by her mother, in a Member State other than that where the father habitually resides, the factors to be taken into consideration include, first, the duration, regularity, conditions and reasons for the mother's stay in the territory of the former Member State and, second, the mother's geographic and family origins and the family and social connections which the mother and child have with that Member State (see judgment of 22 December 2010, Mercredi, C‑497/10 PPU, EU:C:2010:829, paragraphs 54 to 56).</p>

            <p>Consequently, the consent of the father or the absence of that consent, in the exercise of his rights of custody, to the child settling permanently in a place cannot be a consideration that is decisive for the determination of the `habitual residence' of that child, within the meaning of Regulation No 2201/2003, which is consistent, it may be added, with the idea that that concept reflects essentially a question of fact.</p>

            <p>Third, in a case such as that in the main proceedings, to consider that the initial intention of the parents is a factor of crucial importance in determining the habitual residence of a child would be detrimental to the effectiveness of the return procedure and to legal certainty.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be recalled that a return procedure is, inherently, an expedited procedure, since its aim is to ensure, as stated in the preamble of the 1980 Hague Convention and in recital 17 of Regulation No 2201/2003, the prompt return of the child. The EU legislature has moreover given concrete expression to that imperative, in Article 11(3) of Regulation No 2201/2003, by requiring courts seised of applications for return to issue their judgments, save in exceptional circumstances, no later than six weeks after the application is lodged.</p>

            <p>An application for return must therefore be based on information that is quickly and readily verifiable and, so far as possible, unequivocal. Yet, in a case such as that in the main proceedings, it may be difficult, if not impossible, to establish beyond all reasonable doubt, for example, the date initially envisaged by the parents for the mother's return to the Member State where they were habitually resident, and whether the mother's decision to remain in the Member State where the child has been born is the cause or, on the contrary, the consequence of the divorce proceedings brought by the father before the courts of the former Member State.</p>

            <p>In brief, to interpret, in such a context, the concept of the `habitual residence' of a child, within the meaning of Regulation No 2201/2003, in such a way that the initial intention of the parents as to the place which `ought to have been' the place of that residence would constitute the fundamental factor, would be likely to compel the national courts either to gather a substantial quantity of evidence and testimony in order to determine with certainty that intention, which would be difficult to reconcile with the requirement that a return procedure should be expeditious, or to issue their judgments while not in possession of all the relevant information, which would result in legal uncertainty.</p>

            <p>Fourth, in a case such as that in the main proceedings, such an interpretation of the concept of `habitual residence' as is suggested by the referring court would be contrary to the objectives of the return procedure.</p>

            <p>It is clear from the explanatory report on the 1980 Hague Convention that one of the objectives of that convention and, by extension, of Article 11 of Regulation No 2201/2003, is the restoration of the status quo ante, that is, the situation that existed prior to the wrongful removal or retention of the child. The aim of the return procedure is accordingly to put the child back in the environment with which the child is most familiar and, thereby, to restore the continuity of the child's living conditions and the conditions in which the child can develop.</p>

            <p>However, in a situation such as that in the main proceedings, in accordance with that objective, the alleged wrongful conduct of one of the parents cannot in itself justify the granting of an application for return and the removal of the child from the Member State where the child has been born and has lawfully and continuously lived to a Member State with which the child is not familiar.</p>

            <p>Admittedly, it is also an objective of the return procedure envisaged by the 1980 Hague Convention and Regulation No 2201/2003 that one of the parents cannot strengthen his or her position on the issue of custody with respect to the child by evading, by a wrongful act, the jurisdiction of the courts that are as a matter of principle designated, according to the rules laid down in particular by that regulation, to give a ruling on parental responsibility with respect to that child (see, to that effect, judgments of 23 December 2009, Detiček, C‑403/09 PPU, EU:C:2009:810, paragraph 49, and of 9 October 2014, C, C‑376/14 PPU, EU:C:2014:2268, paragraph 67).</p>

          <content eId="para_9270__content">
            <p>In that regard, it must, however, be stressed that, in the present case, no evidence has been provided to suggest an intention by the mother to circumvent the grounds of jurisdiction laid down by that regulation in matters of parental responsibility.</p>

          <content eId="para_9271__content">
            <p>Moreover, it must be made clear that a decision on the return or the non-return of the child does not settle the issue of rights of custody with respect to that child. Accordingly, a failure to succeed in a return procedure in the main proceedings is without prejudice to the father's option of asserting his rights with respect to the child by means of proceedings on the substance of parental responsibility, brought before the courts with the relevant jurisdiction under the provisions of Regulation No 2201/2003, in the course of which a thorough examination of all the circumstances, including the conduct of the parents, may be carried out (see, by analogy, judgment of 5 October 2010, McB., C‑400/10 PPU, EU:C:2010:582, paragraph 58).</p>

            <p>Last, and given that, as stated in paragraph 40 of the present judgment, the concept of `habitual residence', within the meaning of Regulation No 2201/2003, must be interpreted according to the best interests of the child, it must be stated that that fundamental consideration does not, in this case, call for an interpretation such as that proposed by the referring court. In particular, the right of the child to maintain a personal relationship and direct contact with both parents, enshrined in Article 24(3) of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, does not require that the child should travel to the Member State where the parents were resident before the child's birth. It will be possible to safeguard that fundamental right within the framework of proceedings on the substance of rights of custody, as envisaged in the preceding paragraph, in the course of which the question of custody may be reassessed and, if necessary, possible rights of access established.</p>

            <p>Moreover, it is more consistent with the criterion of proximity, prioritised by the EU legislature within Regulation No 2201/2003 precisely in order to ensure that the best interests of the child are taken into account, that any decisions concerning the child are taken by courts of the Member State in which the child has lived continuously since her birth (see, to that effect, judgments of 23 December 2009, Detiček, C‑403/09 PPU, EU:C:2009:810, paragraph 36, and of 15 July 2010, Purrucker, C‑256/09, EU:C:2010:437, paragraph 91).</p>

            <p>For those reasons, in a case such as that in the main proceedings, Article 11(1) of Regulation No 2201/2003 cannot be interpreted as meaning that, immediately before the retention claimed by the father, the child was `habitually resident', within the meaning of that provision, in the Member State where her parents were habitually resident before her birth. Consequently, the refusal of the mother to return together with the child to that Member State cannot constitute a `wrongful removal or retention' of the child, within the meaning of that provision.</p>
