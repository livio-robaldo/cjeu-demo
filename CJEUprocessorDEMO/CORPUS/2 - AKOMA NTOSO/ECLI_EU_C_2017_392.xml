            <p>The order for reference states that on 25 February 2011, the LDz, acting as principal, placed a group of tank wagons under the external Community transit procedure, within the meaning of Article 91 of the Customs Code, by producing a rail freight waybill. The cargo in transit, namely solvent, was to be transported by its carrier, Baltijas Tranzīta Serviss, to the customs office at its destination, which was the border control post at the port of Ventspils (Latvia).</p>

On 28 February and 1 March 2011, standard reports, namely an inspection report and a technical assessment report, on the defects of the tank concerned and the measures taken to prevent damage were drawn up. On 1 March 2011, it was also recorded in a report of loss that 2448 kilograms (kg) of cargo was missing from the tank concerned.</p>

            <p>On 10 March 2011, the Customs office of destination found a loss of cargo of 2488 kg due to the fact that the lower unloading device of one of the wagon tanks in question had not been correctly closed or had been damaged. As the documents relating to the presentation of missing cargo and to completion of the transit procedure without irregularity had not been presented to the customs office and in the absence of evidence that the cargo deficit resulted from an act by the sender, the VID adopted a decision by which it calculated the LDz's customs debt in the sum of Latvian Lats (LVL) 63.26 (about EUR 90.01) and its VAT debt in the sum of LVL 228.02 (about EUR 324.44). The LDz challenged that decision. The Director-General upheld that decision by a decision of 16 September 2011.</p>

Furthermore, the LDz submitted that the VID had not taken into account the fact that the cargo deficit found had resulted from the total destruction or irretrievable loss of the goods concerned as a result of the actual nature of the goods or unforeseeable circumstances or force majeure.</p>

            <p>During its examination of the appeal in cassation brought by the LDz, the Augstākās tiesas Administratīvo lietu departaments (Supreme Court, Administrative Cases Department, Latvia) entertained doubts, first of all, as to whether the VID and the lower courts were correct in law to have applied, in the present case, Article 203(1) of the customs code concerning the unlawful removal of goods from customs supervision. That court states in that regard that, on the one hand, the VID considers that paragraph 2.2 of the `Transit manual' of the Commission's Directorate-General `Taxation and Customs Union' (Working Document Taxud/2033/2008-LV Rev. 4) of 15 September 2009 applies in all cases where a deficit in goods is found by the customs office of destination, whilst, on the other hand, the LDz emphasises the findings establishing, in the present case, that there was a leak of solvent from the tank concerned for a technical reason and refers to the measures taken to repair that damage.</p>

          <content eId="para_8308__content">
            <p>In that context, the referring court questions whether, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, it would not be more appropriate to apply Article 204(1)(a) of the Customs Code, read in combination with the derogation laid down in Article 206(1) of that code, which permits the customs debt on importation not to be calculated if it is proved that the goods have been totally destroyed, which precludes the entry of those goods into EU economy.</p>

          <content eId="para_8309__content">
            <p>Next, the referring court recalls that the question of exoneration from the payment of duties on importation is linked to that of exoneration from VAT. In that regard, it takes as its starting point the principle that, because the application of the Customs Code does not require the calculation of customs duties on importation for goods which were destroyed while they were under the external Community transit procedure, and which, for that reason, did not enter the EU economy, VAT should also not be paid.</p>

            <p>Finally, that court notes that, even if it is sufficiently clear from Article 94(1) and Article 96(1) of the Customs Code that the principal is liable for the payment of the customs debt and even though the Court has emphasised in its case-law the importance of the liability of the principal in the context of safeguarding the financial interests of the European Union and the Member States, questions remain as to the meaning of the provisions of the Customs Code which provide for the liability of other persons as regards both the performance of the obligations under the external Community transit procedure and payment of the customs debt. Pursuant to both Article 203 of the Customs Code and Article 204 thereof, the circle of persons whose liability could be engaged as a result of the leak concerned may be wider than the principal alone.</p>

            <p>In accordance with the Court's case-law, the concept of `unlawful removal from customs supervision', appearing in Article 203(1) of the Customs Code, must be understood as encompassing any act or omission the result of which is to prevent, if only for a short time, the competent customs authority from gaining access to goods under customs supervision and from monitoring them as provided for in Article 37(1) of the Customs Code (see judgments of 1 February 2001, D. Wandel, C‑66/99, EU:C:2001:69, paragraph 47, and of 12 June 2014, SEK Zollagentur, C‑75/13, EU:C:2014:1759, paragraph 28 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Hence, any withdrawal from authorised storage of goods subject to customs supervision -- whether intentional or not intentional, such as a theft -- without the authorisation of the customs authority constitutes unlawful removal from customs supervision for the purposes of Article 203(1) of the Customs Code and thus gives rise under that provision to a customs debt on importation (see, to that effect, the judgments of 1 February 2001, D. Wandel, C‑66/99, EU:C:2001:69, paragraphs 48 and 50; of 12 February 2004, Hamann International, C‑337/01, EU:C:2004:90, paragraph 36; and of 11 July 2013, Harry Winston, C‑273/12, EU:C:2013:466, paragraphs 30 and 33). Similarly, the Court has held that an article left for temporary storage must be deemed to have been removed from customs supervision if it is declared for an external Community transit procedure, but it does not in fact leave the storage facility and is not presented to the customs office at the place of destination, although the transit documents have been presented there (judgment of 12 June 2014, SEK Zollagentur, C‑75/13, EU:C:2014:1759, paragraph 33).</p>

            <p>However, the application of Article 203(1) of the Customs Code is justified where the disappearance of the goods presents a risk that they have entered the economic networks of the European Union without clearing customs (see, to that effect, the judgments of 20 January 2005, Honeywell Aerospace, C‑300/03, EU:C:2005:43, paragraph 20, and of 15 May 2014, X, C‑480/12, EU:C:2014:329, paragraphs 35 and 36).</p>

            <p>However, that is not the case when the goods disappear due to their total destruction or irretrievable loss -- such loss being defined under Article 206(1), second paragraph, of the Customs Code as when the goods are unusable by any person -- in the case of the leak of a liquid, such as the solvent at issue in the main proceedings, from a tank during its transportation. Goods which no longer exist or are unusable by any person cannot, for that sole reason, enter the economic networks of the European Union.</p>

Article 70 of the VAT Directive lays down the principle that the chargeable event occurs and the tax becomes chargeable at the moment when the goods are imported. Thus, Article 71(1) of the VAT Directive provides, in its first subparagraph, that, where, on entry into the European Union, goods are placed under the external Community transit procedure, the chargeable event occurs and the tax becomes chargeable only when the goods cease to be covered by that procedure (see, to that effect, the judgment of 11 July 2013, Harry Winston, C‑273/12, EU:C:2013:466, paragraph 40).</p>

            <p>As is clear from paragraphs 76 to 79 and 82 above, under Article 96(1)(a), Article 204(1)(a) and (3) of Customs Code the principal is responsible for the payment of the customs debt arising in relation to goods placed under the external Community transit procedure, even if the carrier has not fulfilled the obligations to which he was subject under Article 96(2) of the Customs Code.</p>

          <content eId="para_8355__content">
            <p>It follows that the Customs Code, by imposing that objective liability upon the principal establishes a basic legal mechanism that facilitates, in particular, the proper functioning of transit operations in order to protect the financial interests of the European Union and its Member States (judgment of 15 July 2010, DSV Road, C‑234/09, EU:C:2010:435, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In that regard, the Court has stated that the mechanism of joint and several liability provided for in Article 213 of the code constitutes an additional legal device made available to the national authorities to strengthen the effectiveness of the action they take for the recovery of customs debts and the protection of the EU's own resources (judgment of 17 February 2011, Berel and Others, C‑78/10, EU:C:2011:93, paragraph 48).</p>

            <p>Consequently, it must be held that, in circumstances such as those in the case in the main proceedings, the customs authority of a Member State is indeed required to declare the liability of the principal. However, it follows from the nature of the mechanism of the joint and several liability referred to in paragraph 85 above that that authority may, but is not obliged to, declare the joint and several liability of the carrier.</p>

            <p>It is appropriate to clarify, in that regard, that the fact that the customs authority of a Member State does not ask, pursuant to that joint liability, the carrier to pay the customs debt in no way prejudices the right of the principal to bring an action for damages against the carrier.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Eighth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 203(1) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code, as amended by Regulation (EC) No 648/2005 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 April 2005 must be interpreted as meaning that it does not apply where the total volume of the goods placed under the external Community transit procedure has not been presented to the customs office of destination provided for in that procedure, owing to the total destruction or irretrievable loss of some of the goods, which is proven to a satisfactory standard. 2. Article 204(1)(a) of Regulation No 2913/92, as amended by Regulation No 648/2005 must be interpreted as meaning that where the total volume of goods placed under the external Community transit procedure has not been produced at the customs office of destination laid down in that procedure owing to the total destruction or irretrievable loss of some of the goods, proven to a satisfactory standard, that situation, which constitutes the non-fulfilment of one of the obligations under that procedure, namely to produce goods intact at the customs office of destination, gives rise, in principle, to a customs debt on importation for the part of the goods which was not produced at that customs office. It is for the national court to determine whether a circumstance such as damage to an unloading device meets, in the present case, the criteria of `force majeure' or an `unforeseeable circumstance', within the meaning of Article 206(1) of Regulation No 2913/92, as amended by Regulation No 648/2005, namely, whether it is an abnormal circumstance for a trader in the business of the transportation of liquid substances and extraneous to that trader, and whether the consequences could not have been avoided even if all due care had been exercised. In the context of that determination, that court must, in particular, take into account compliance, by operators such as the principal and the carrier, with the rules and obligations in force regarding the technical condition of tanks and the safety of transportation of liquid substances such as a solvent. 3. Article 2(1)(d) and Articles 70 and 71 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax must be interpreted as meaning that VAT is not due on the totally destroyed or irretrievably lost part of goods placed under the external Community transit procedure. 4. Article 96(1)(a) in conjunction with Article 204(1)(a) and (3) of Regulation No 2913/92, as amended by Regulation No 648/2005, must be interpreted as meaning that the principal is liable for the payment of the customs debt arising in relation to goods placed under the external Community transit procedure, even if the carrier did not fulfil the obligations to which he was subject under Article 96(2) of that regulation, in particular the requirement to produce those goods intact at the customs office of destination within the prescribed period. 5. Article 96(1)(a) and (2), Article 204(1)(a) and (3) and Article 213 of Regulation No 2913/92, as amended by Regulation No 648/2005, must be interpreted as meaning that the customs authority of a Member State is not obliged to declare the joint and several liability of the carrier who, together with the principal, must be regarded as liable for payment of the customs debt.</p>
