                <p>One of the objectives of Community action in the field of education is to promote Europe as a whole as a world centre of excellence for studies and vocational training. Promoting the mobility of third-country nationals to the Community for the purpose of studies is a key factor in that strategy. The approximation of the Member States' national legislation on conditions of entry and residence is part of this.</p>

                <p>Migration for the purposes set out in this Directive, which is by definition temporary and does not depend on the labour-market situation in the host country, constitutes a form of mutual enrichment for the migrants concerned, their country of origin and the host Member State and helps to promote better familiarity among cultures. ...</p>

                <p>Admission for the purposes set out in this Directive may be refused on duly justified grounds. In particular, admission could be refused if a Member State considers, based on an assessment of the facts, that the third-country national concerned is a potential threat to public policy or public security. The notion of public policy may cover a conviction for committing a serious crime. In this context it has to be noted that the notions of public policy and public security also cover cases in which a third-country national belongs or has belonged to an association which supports terrorism, supports or has supported such an association, or has or has had extremist aspirations.</p>

The subjects of Ms Fahimian's research project were described in that letter as ranging from `security of mobile systems, esp. intrusion detection on smartphones to security protocols'. The managing director also explained that Ms Fahimian's task within that project would be to `find new efficient and effective protections mechanisms for smartphones under the well-known restrictions of restricted power, restricted computing resources, and restricted bandwidth'.</p>

            <p>The order for reference states that the defendant in the main proceedings submits that the situation in Iran gives reason to fear that the knowledge Ms Fahimian would acquire during her stay for study purposes would later be misused in her country of origin. According to the defendant, the Iranian Government has for a long time been developing a large scale cyber-programme by which it hopes to gain access to confidential information in western countries. The defendant states that hackers are searching essentially for sensitive data from the air and aerospace sectors and the arms industry. According to security experts, hacking attacks are being undertaken in particular in order to obtain construction plans and research results for the Iranian nuclear programme, which is suspected of pursuing military objectives.</p>

            <p>In this context, the significance of SUT's involvement in the field of research for military purposes in Iran is said to be recognised in the international community. The defendant in the main proceedings observes in this respect that the nature of that involvement induced the EU legislature, by Council Implementing Regulation (EU) No 1264/2012 of 21 December 2012 implementing Regulation (EU) No 267/2012 ( OJ 2012 L 356, p. 55), originally to add that university to the list of entities subject to restrictive measures in Annex IX to Regulation No 267/2012. That listing was annulled by the General Court of the European Union, by its judgment of 3 July 2014, Sharif University of Technology v Council ( T‑181/13, not published, EU:T:2014:607). The EU legislature added that university to that list once again by Implementing Regulation No 1202/2014. The defendant in the main proceedings notes that the reason for putting SUT back on the list was the proven close connection between it and the Iranian regime in the military or related fields.</p>

            <p>The same applies to additional elements available to the competent national authorities which give reason to fear that the knowledge Ms Fahimian will acquire in Germany may subsequently be misused for purposes, such as those suggested by the referring court in its second question, contrary to the maintenance of public security.</p>

            <p>Having regard to all the above considerations, the answer to the questions referred is that Article 6(1)(d) of Directive 2004/114 must be interpreted as meaning that the competent national authorities, where a third country national has applied to them for a visa for study purposes, have a wide discretion in ascertaining, in the light of all the relevant elements of the situation of that national, whether he represents a threat, if only potential, to public security. That provision must also be interpreted as not precluding the competent national authorities from refusing to admit to the territory of the Member State concerned, for study purposes, a third country national who holds a degree from a university which is the subject of EU restrictive measures because of its large scale involvement with the Iranian Government in military or related fields, and who plans to carry out research in that Member State in a field that is sensitive for public security, if the elements available to those authorities give reason to fear that the knowledge acquired by that person during his research may subsequently be used for purposes contrary to public security. It is for the national court hearing an action brought against the decision of the competent national authorities to refuse to grant the visa sought to ascertain whether that decision is based on sufficient grounds and a sufficiently solid factual basis.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules: Article 6(1)(d) of Council Directive 2004/114/EC of 13 December 2004 on the conditions of admission of third-country nationals for the purposes of studies, pupil exchange, unremunerated training or voluntary service must be interpreted as meaning that the competent national authorities, where a third country national has applied to them for a visa for study purposes, have a wide discretion in ascertaining, in the light of all the relevant elements of the situation of that national, whether he represents a threat, if only potential, to public security. That provision must also be interpreted as not precluding the competent national authorities from refusing to admit to the territory of the Member State concerned, for study purposes, a third country national who holds a degree from a university which is the subject of EU restrictive measures because of its large scale involvement with the Iranian Government in military or related fields, and who plans to carry out research in that Member State in a field that is sensitive for public security, if the elements available to those authorities give reason to fear that the knowledge acquired by that person during his research may subsequently be used for purposes contrary to public security. It is for the national court hearing an action brought against the decision of the competent national authorities to refuse to grant the visa sought to ascertain whether that decision is based on sufficient grounds and a sufficiently solid factual basis.</p>
