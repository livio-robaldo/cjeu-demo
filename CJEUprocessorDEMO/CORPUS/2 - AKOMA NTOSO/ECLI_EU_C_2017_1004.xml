            <p>Mr Gusa, a Romanian national, entered the territory of Ireland in October 2007. During the first year of his residence in that Member State, he was supported by his adult children who also resided there. From October 2008 until October 2012, he worked as a self-employed plasterer and, on that basis, paid his taxes in Ireland, as well as pay related social insurance and other levies on his income.</p>

            <p>He ceased working in October 2012, claiming an absence of work caused by the economic downturn, and registered as a jobseeker with the relevant Irish authorities. He then had no more income, as his children had left Ireland and were no longer supporting him financially.</p>

            <p>The application was, however, refused by a decision of 22 November 2012 on the ground that Mr Gusa had not demonstrated that he still had a right to reside in Ireland at that date. According to the decision, on cessation of his self-employment as a plasterer, Mr Gusa no longer satisfied the conditions for such entitlement laid down in Regulation 6(2) of the 2006 Regulations, which transposes Article 7 of Directive 2004/38 into Irish law.</p>

            <p>Following an unsuccessful internal administrative appeal against that decision, Mr Gusa challenged it before the High Court (Ireland), claiming in particular that, although he had ceased to work in a self-employed capacity, he had retained the status of self-employed person and a right to reside in Ireland pursuant to Article 7 of Directive 2004/38. By a judgment of 17 October 2013, the High Court dismissed the action brought before it. Mr Gusa appealed against that judgment to the Supreme Court (Ireland), which transferred the appeal to the referring court.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, the referring court notes that Mr Gusa does not contend that he has sufficient resources to support himself or that he has comprehensive sickness insurance cover and, therefore, does not claim to have a right to reside in Ireland pursuant to Article 7(1)(b) of Directive 2004/38. Nor does he claim to have acquired a right of permanent residence in Ireland in November 2012.</p>

            <p>However, the referring court queries, first of all, whether, despite having ceased to work as a self-employed plasterer, Mr Gusa must be considered to have retained the status of self-employed person on the basis of Article 7(3)(b) of that directive or of another provision of EU law, so that he would continue to have a right of residence in Ireland under Article 7(1)(a) of that directive. In particular, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 7(3)(b) covers only persons who are involuntarily unemployed after having worked as an employee for more than one year, or whether that provision applies also to persons who are in a comparable situation after having been self-employed for that period.</p>

            <p>Next, if Mr Gusa must be considered to have lost the status of self-employed person, the referring court asks, in essence, whether he must nevertheless be acknowledged as having a right of residence in Ireland under another provision of EU law, notwithstanding the fact that he has neither sufficient resources nor comprehensive sickness insurance cover.</p>

            <p>Last, in the event of a negative answer, the referring court queries whether the refusal to grant Mr Gusa a jobseeker's allowance under the 2005 Act on the ground of his failure to establish such a right to reside is contrary to EU law, in particular Article 4 of Regulation No 883/2004, given that that allowance is a `special non-contributory cash benefit' within the meaning of Article 70 of that regulation.</p>

Article 7(3) of the directive provides that, for the purposes of Article 7(1)(a), a Union citizen who is no longer a worker or self-employed person is nevertheless to retain the status of worker or self-employed person in four cases.</p>

            <p>The referring court states in that regard that, in the present case, it is not in dispute that Mr Gusa registered as a jobseeker with the relevant employment office for the purposes of Article 7(3)(b) of Directive 2004/38. However, the referring court notes, in essence, that it could be inferred from the wording of point (b) that that provision applies only to persons who are in duly recorded involuntary unemployment after having worked as employed persons for more than one year, and excludes those who, like Mr Gusa, are in an equivalent position after having worked as self-employed persons for that period.</p>

          <content eId="para_147__content">
            <p>In particular, contrary to the submissions of the respondents in the main proceedings and the United Kingdom Government, the expression `involuntary unemployment' may, depending on the context in which it is used, refer to a situation of inactivity due to the involuntary loss of employment following, for example, a dismissal, as well as, more broadly, to a situation in which the occupational activity, whether on an employed or self-employed basis, has ceased due to an absence of work for reasons beyond the control of the person concerned, such as an economic recession.</p>

          <content eId="para_148__content">
            <p>Furthermore, as regards the words `after having been employed', used notably in the English-language version and in the French-language version ( ` après avoir été employé') of Article 7(3)(b) of Directive 2004/38 and which, as the respondents in the main proceedings in particular have pointed out, did not appear in the initial or amended proposals for a directive submitted by the European Commission (Proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States ( OJ 2001 C 270 E, p. 150), and Amended proposal for a Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States, COM(2003) 199 final), it is true that those words could be read as referring to previous work as an employee.</p>

          <content eId="para_149__content">
            <p>However, as the Advocate General noted, in essence, in points 48 and 49 of his Opinion, other language versions of that provision, which are formulated in more neutral terms, do not support that interpretation. In particular, the Greek-language version uses the expression ` επαγγελματική δραστηριότητα', thus referring to the pursuit of an `occupational activity', the Italian-language version uses the words ` aver esercitato un `attività', referring to the pursuit of an activity, and the Latvian-language version contains the words ` ir bijis(-usi) nodarbināts(-a)', referring in general terms to persons who have `worked'.</p>

            <p>According to the settled case-law of the Court, the wording used in one language version of a provision of EU law cannot serve as the sole basis for the interpretation of that provision or be made to override the other language versions. Provisions of EU law must be interpreted and applied uniformly in the light of the versions established in all the languages of the European Union. Where there is divergence between the various versions, the provision in question must be interpreted by reference to the general scheme and the purpose of the rules of which it forms part (judgment of 1 March 2016, Alo and Osso, C‑443/14 and C‑444/14, EU:C:2016:127, paragraph 27 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>As regards the general scheme of Directive 2004/38, it should be noted that, as Article 1(a) thereof provides, the purpose of the directive is to define, inter alia, the conditions governing the exercise of the right of free movement and residence within the territory of the Member States by Union citizens.</p>

            <p>To that end, Article 7(1) of the directive distinguishes, in particular, the situation of economically active citizens from that of inactive citizens and students. That provision does not, however, draw a distinction, within the first category, between citizens working as employed persons and those working as self-employed persons in the host Member State.</p>

Similarly, Article 7(3) of that directive refers, in its introductory sentence, to Union citizens who, although no longer `worker[s] or self-employed person[s]', are to retain the status of `worker or self-employed person' for the purposes of Article 7(1)(a).</p>
