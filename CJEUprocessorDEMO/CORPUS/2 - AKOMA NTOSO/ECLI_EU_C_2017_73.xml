According to the relevant provisions of that law, if the notary accepts the payment, he endorses the request with the acceptance formula.

            <p>Article 195 of the Code of Civil Procedure determines the probative value of the authentic instrument.

According to the relevant provisions of the Law on non-contentious notarial procedures, it is not possible to resort to the prior gathering of evidence if civil or criminal proceedings are pending in the case at issue.

That procedure is governed by Articles 36/A to 36/D of the Law on non-contentious notarial procedures. According to the relevant provisions of that law, it is possible to obtain before the notary the dissolution of the registered partnership on the condition that the registered partners request it jointly and freely, that neither registered partner has a child in respect of which the partners jointly assume a maintenance obligation and that the registered partners have reached an agreement, in a notarial instrument or in a private instrument countersigned by a lawyer, on matters relating to the maintenance obligation owed in law by one to the other, on the use of the common dwelling and on the distribution of the joint assets of the partnership. The formal approval of an agreement between the parties has the same effect as an agreement approved by a court, and a formal decision dissolving a registered partnership has the same effect as the judgment of a court.

In so far as it provides for an exception to freedom of establishment for activities participating in the exercise of official authority, that provision should also be interpreted strictly and the exception should be restricted to activities which, of themselves, involve a direct and specific participation in the exercise of official authority.

            <p>The functions exercised by the notary do not involve the exercise of decision-making powers, powers of enforcement or powers of coercion. They are preventive in nature and are therefore ancillary or preparatory to the exercise of official authority. Factors such as the regulated nature of notarial activities, the fact that notaries are considered by Hungarian criminal law as exercising official authority, the territorial jurisdiction of notaries, their irremovability, the incompatibility of the notarial profession with the exercise of other functions and the fact that notaries may not refuse a client do not call that conclusion into question.</p>

            <p>As regards, first, the order for payment procedure, the Commission submits that notaries carry out an ancillary activity with which they have been entrusted in order to relieve the pressure on the judiciary. Since that procedure concerns only pecuniary claims which are undisputed and outstanding, notaries have no decision-making power in respect of the parties. Notaries' powers are thus limited to the completion of procedural formalities. They may not issue an order other than that for payment and are not competent to hear the challenge to a claim. Moreover, the order for payment issued by the notary becomes final and enforceable only if it is not disputed by the debtor within the allotted time period. Finally, the fact that that order has significant legal effects is not sufficient to demonstrate direct and specific participation in the exercise of official authority.</p>

            <p>As regards, second, the enforcement of the order for payment, the Commission maintains that notaries have no discretion or decision-making powers. They do not settle disputes, hear the parties or request the production of evidence, but merely enforce orders for payment which are not disputed. The enforceability of those orders does not confer on notaries a power of enforcement. Notaries merely render the claim indisputable until proved otherwise, without deciding on the merits of the challenge to the claim. The endorsement of the order for payment with the authority to enforce is therefore an ancillary and preparatory activity.</p>

            <p>As regards, third, the procedure relating to inheritance matters, the Commission observes that this is a non-contentious civil procedure, during which it is possible for the parties to conclude an agreement which the notary confirms by way of a formal decision. The fact that, under Hungarian law, an estate which is the subject of a dispute may be transferred by a notary only with provisional title demonstrates that notaries are not empowered to settle a dispute during the procedure on inheritance matters. Nor does the transfer of the estate with full title by a notary entail the exercise of decision-making powers or powers of enforcement, since that transfer presupposes prior consent or agreement between the parties.</p>

          <content eId="para_19856__content">
            <p>Moreover, the formal transfer decision cannot be regarded as final in so far as it is open to challenge before the courts. As to the binding, preparatory or protective measures that notaries may adopt in order to ensure the proper conduct of the procedure relating to inheritance matters, they do not affect the substance of the rights in question and are incidental to the principal task of the notary.</p>

            <p>Fourth, notaries play only a passive role in the procedure relating to the depositing of monies with a notary. They do not assess challenges. The procedure relating to the depositing of monies with a notary does not, therefore, entail the exercise of any discretion, decision-making powers or powers of enforcement.</p>

          <content eId="para_19858__content">
            <p>With respect, fifth, to the drawing up of notarial instruments, the Commission submits that the significance of the legal effects produced by those instruments is not sufficient to demonstrate that that activity is part of the exercise of official authority. The probative value of notarial instruments does not unconditionally bind courts in their assessment of evidence. In addition, it may be possible to adduce evidence to the contrary. The enforceability of those instruments admittedly allows the creditor to continue enforcing the debt without having to bring an action before the courts. However, the role of notaries in that regard is limited to verifying compliance with the conditions legally required for endorsing the act with the authority to enforce. Notaries therefore have no decision-making powers or powers of enforcement.</p>

Notaries' status in Hungary is comparable to that of judges and other persons involved in the exercise of official authority. Tasked with the prevention of disputes through the implementation of non-contentious procedures, notaries are part of the system for the administration of justice. They may not refuse a case which falls within their substantive competence and their actions, although carried out as part of non-contentious procedures, have the same effect as judicial decisions. Notaries, like judges, act independently. They also exercise discretion and decision-making powers and may implement official measures of enforcement.</p>

            <p>Hungary submits, first, that the procedure for issuing an order for payment is intended to relieve the pressure on the judiciary. By issuing, at the request of a creditor, an order requiring the debtor to pay a sum of money without that debtor having to be heard, notaries decide definitively on a question of private law. In practice, only a small percentage of the orders for payment issued by notaries were challenged. Furthermore, notaries in the Hungarian legal system are also competent to issue orders for payment in accordance with Regulation No 1896/2006.</p>

            <p>Second, the enforcement of the order for payment entails, according to Hungary, direct participation in the exercise of official authority because enforcement is a coercive measure leading to the debtor being deprived of property on account of his debt. The existence of legal remedies against notaries' formal decision to proceed with enforcement arises from the need to respect fundamental rights and does not mean that the decision has diminished legal authority. Moreover, that type of remedy does not relate to the question whether or not to order enforcement, but merely on the lawfulness of that decision.</p>

            <p>As regards, third, the procedure in inheritance matters, Hungary submits that notaries do not merely carry out preparatory tasks in relation to the work of a court but themselves carry out the entire procedure relating to inheritance matters and take the formal decision to transfer the estate. Unlike notaries in the Austrian legal system, notaries in the Hungarian legal system do not intervene as agents of the court but act by virtue of their own power and take all decisions themselves. In addition, they may take protective measures. Moreover, the number of judicial appeals against notaries' decisions in inheritance matters is negligible.</p>

            <p>As regards, fourth, the procedure relating to the depositing of monies with a notary, Hungary observes that it has the same effect as the procedure relating to payments into court.

            <p>Fifth, Hungary argues that the notarial activity consisting in the drafting of authentic instruments is strictly regulated. The official nature of the authentic instrument drawn up by the notary is further attested by the authority to enforce affixed to that instrument when the legal conditions are met. Since that authority makes it possible to enforce a claim by resorting to public measures of enforcement under the same conditions and in accordance with the same procedure as those applicable to the enforcement of a decision by the courts, notaries fulfil the same role as the courts in the context of the settlement and the prevention of disputes. The judgment of 17 June 1999, Unibank ( C‑260/97, EU:C:1999:312), confirms that only acts relating to the exercise of official authority may be deemed enforceable. Moreover, Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters ( OJ 2001 L 12, p. 1) and Regulation (EC) No 805/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 April 2004 creating a European Enforcement Order for uncontested claims ( OJ 2004 L 143, p. 15) confer on undertakings contained in authentic instruments enforceability similar to that of court decisions.</p>

Hungary states, however, that while the annulment of a negotiable instrument has the consequence of rendering impossible the exercise of the right which it establishes or the enforcement of the obligation it provides, it does not change the legal relationship underlying that negotiable instrument. The annulment of that instrument simply makes it possible to issue a new negotiable instrument which replaces the previous one.</p>

Moreover, orders for payment issued by a notary only become binding if the debtor does not challenge them. The notary's intervention thus presupposes the consent of the debtor.</p>

            <p>That conclusion is not called into question by Hungary's argument concerning Regulation No 1896/2006. It is clear in particular from recital 9 and Article 1(a) of that regulation that the European order for payment procedure concerns only uncontested pecuniary claims. Furthermore, under Article 18(1) of that regulation, the European order for payment is declared enforceable if no statement of opposition has been sent within the prescribed period. The issuance of the European order for payment imposed by Regulation No 1896/2006 therefore has the same characteristics as those referred to in paragraph 110 of the present judgment.</p>

The probative force conferred by law on a particular document thus has no direct effect on whether the activity which includes the drawing up of the document is in itself directly and specifically connected with the exercise of official authority, as required by the case-law (judgment of 1 December 2011, Commission v Netherlands, C‑157/09, not published, EU:C:2011:794, paragraph 74 and the case-law cited).</p>

The principle that the court is unfettered in its assessment of the evidence is, moreover, enshrined in Article 206 of the Code of Civil Procedure (see, by analogy, judgment of 1 December 2011, Commission v Netherlands, C‑157/09, not published, EU:C:2011:794, paragraph 76 and the case-law cited).</p>

Further, the Court held, in paragraphs 15 and 21 of that judgment, that, in order to endow an act with the character of an `authentic' instrument within the meaning of Article 50 of that convention, the involvement of a public authority or any other authority empowered for that purpose by the State of origin is needed.</p>

            <p>As regards notaries' powers in relation to the prior gathering of evidence, it should be noted that the objective of that procedure is to ensure that evidence in the acquisition of which an applicant has a legal interest is collected with a view to the possible subsequent introduction of contentious proceedings, which, however, do not fall within the notary's powers. Thus, the Law on non-contentious notarial procedures provides that it is not possible to resort to the prior gathering of evidence if civil or criminal proceedings are pending in the case. Notaries' powers with respect to the prior gathering of evidence therefore constitute ancillary or preparatory activities with respect to the exercise of official authority.</p>

In the same way as for the prior gathering of evidence, the notary may not, under Article 21(2) of the Law on non-contentious notarial procedures, appoint a judicial expert if, as regards the question for which the person requesting the measure wishes to obtain an expert opinion, another judicial procedure is pending, in which that person is an applicant or defendant, or if criminal proceedings are pending against him.</p>
