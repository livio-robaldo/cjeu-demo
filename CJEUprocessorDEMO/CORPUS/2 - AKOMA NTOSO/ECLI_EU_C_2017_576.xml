            <p>On 26 March 2011, a road traffic accident occurred in Italy, involving a cyclist domiciled in Austria who is an employee of KABEG and the driver of a car covered by civil liability insurance provided by MMA IARD.

            <p>KABEG brought an action before the Landesgericht Klagenfurt (Regional Court, Klagenfurt, Austria) seeking an order that MMA IARD pay damages of EUR 15505.64 plus interest and costs. KABEG explained that it had continued to pay the salary of the employee injured in the road traffic accident while he was on sick leave after that accident. On that basis, the employee's financial entitlement to that sum passed to KABEG.</p>

            <p>KABEG takes the view that the Landesgericht Klagenfurt (Regional Court, Klagenfurt) has international jurisdiction based on Article 9(1)(b) of Regulation No 44/2001, read in conjunction with Article 11(2) thereof.

            <p>MMA IARD raised a plea of lack of jurisdiction, arguing that Section 3 of Chapter 2 of that regulation establishes a specific system for the resolution of conflicts of jurisdiction in matters relating to insurance. According to recital 13 thereof, the special rules of jurisdiction laid down by that section aim to protect the weaker party. KABEG, as the employer, cannot rely on such protection.</p>

            <p>The Landesgericht Klagenfurt (Regional Court, Klagenfurt) dismissed that plea of lack of jurisdiction on the ground that KABEG, which merely asserts a claim derived from its employee, may rely on Article 9(1)(b) of Regulation No 44/2001, read together with Article 11(2) thereof, since such a legal person is, irrespective of its size, the weaker party in a dispute with an insurance company.</p>

            <p>MMA IARD appealed against that decision before the Oberlandesgericht Graz (Higher Regional Court, Graz, Austria) which upheld the plea of lack of jurisdiction, varied the decision and dismissed the appeal. That court observed, inter alia, that the reference in Article 11(2) of that regulation to Article 9(1)(b) gives the injured party, whether a natural or legal person, the right to sue the insurer before the competent court of the Member State in which it is domiciled or is established. Furthermore, the concept of `injured party' includes both parties which are directly injured and those indirectly injured.</p>

            <p>However, according to that court, not all injured parties enjoy such a right. In that connection, in order to determine whether an injured party is entitled to rely on that right, it must be ascertained whether that injured party is `economically weaker and less experienced in legal matters' than a civil-liability insurer. That is not the case as regards a public law institution running five hospitals, such as KABEG.</p>

                <p>If the first question is to be answered in the negative: Should Article 9(1)(b), in conjunction with Article 11(2), of Regulation No 44/2001 be interpreted as meaning that the employer which has continued to pay remuneration can, as an ``injured party '', sue the civil-liability insurer of the vehicle at fault in the courts for the place where the employer is domiciled, in so far as such a direct action is permitted?'</p>

            <p>By its questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks essentially whether Article 9(1)(b) of Regulation No 44/2001, read in conjunction with Article 11(2) thereof, must be interpreted as meaning that an employer established in one Member State, which continued to pay the salary of its employee absent from work following a road accident, to which have been passed the employee's rights vis-à-vis the company insuring the civil liability of the vehicle involved in that accident which is established in a second Member State, may, as the `injured party' within the meaning of the latter provision, sue the insurance company before the courts of the first Member State where a direct action is permitted.</p>

            <p>In that connection, it must be recalled that Section 3 of Chapter 2 of that regulation establishes an autonomous system for the conferral of jurisdiction in matters of insurance (judgment of 12 May 2005, Société financière et industrielle de Peloux, C‑112/03, EU:C:2005:280, paragraph 29).</p>

            <p>In the same way as matters relating to workers and consumers, and as is clear from recital 13 of Regulation No 44/2001, a matter relating to insurance is characterised by a certain imbalance between the parties (see, to that effect, judgment of 26 May 2005, GIE Réunion européenne and Others, C‑77/04, EU:C:2005:327, paragraph 22) that the provisions of that section aim to correct by enabling the weaker party to benefit from rules of jurisdiction more favourable to his interests than the general rules provide for (see, to that effect, judgment of 17 September 2009, Vorarlberger Gebietskrankenkasse, C‑347/08, EU:C:2009:561, paragraph 40).</p>

            <p>The questions of the referring court as to the classification of an employer, which is the statutory assignee of the injured party's rights, as the `weaker party' arise from the finding made by the Court that a social security institution, which is the statutory assignee of the rights of the person directly injured in a car accident cannot be classified as such, whereas a person to whom the rights of the person directly injured have passed, such as an heir, may be (see, to that effect, judgment of 17 September 2009, Vorarlberger Gebietskrankenkasse, C‑347/08, EU:C:2009:561, paragraphs 42 and 44).</p>

            <p>In that connection, the referring court explains that, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, the possibility for an employer to which have passed the rights of its employee to sue the civil liability insurer of the person responsible for the injury before the courts of the Member State in which the employer is established would ensure consistency between the rules of jurisdiction and, therefore, their predictability and a proper administration of justice.</p>

            <p>Therefore, it the present case, it is necessary to examine whether employers to which the rights of the person directly injured have been transmitted are covered by the concept of `injured party' within the meaning of Article 11(2) of Regulation No 44/2001.</p>

            <p>As the Advocate General observed, in point 47 of his Opinion, the notion of the `weaker party' has a wider acceptance in matters relating to insurance than those relating to consumer contracts or individual employment contracts.</p>

            <p>It should also be recalled that the Court has held that the purpose of the reference in Article 11(2) of Regulation No 44/2001 is to add injured parties to the list of plaintiffs contained in Article 9(1)(b) of that regulation, without restricting the category of persons having suffered damage to those suffering it directly (judgments of 13 December 2007, FBTO Schadeverzekeringen, C‑463/06, EU:C:2007:792, paragraph 26, and of 17 September 2009, Vorarlberger Gebietskrankenkasse, C‑347/08, EU:C:2009:561, paragraph 27).</p>

          <content eId="para_14017__content">
            <p>Furthermore, as the referring court observed in its order for reference, a case-by-case assessment of the question whether an employer which continues to pay the salary may be regarded as the economically weaker party in order to be covered by the definition of `injured party' within the meaning of Article 11(2) of Regulation No 44/2001, would give rise to the risk of legal uncertainty and would be contrary to the objective of that regulation, laid down in recital 11 thereof, according to which the rules of jurisdiction must be highly predictable.</p>

            <p>Therefore, it must be held that, pursuant to Article 11(2) of Regulation No 44/2001, employers to which the rights of their employees to compensation have passed may, as persons which have suffered damage and whatever their size and legal form, rely on the rules of special jurisdiction laid down in Articles 8 to 10 of that regulation.</p>

            <p>Thus, the employer to which the rights of its employee have passed in order to be reimbursed for the salary paid to the latter during a period of incapacity to work, which, solely in that capacity, has brought an action for damages may be regarded as weaker than the insurer that it sues and, therefore, is able to benefit from the possibility to bring that action before the courts of the Member State in which it is established.</p>

            <p>It follows that an employer to which the rights of the employee injured in a road traffic accident have passed and for whom it continued to pay his salary may, as the `injured party', sue the insurer of the vehicle involved in that accident before the courts of the Member State in which the employer is established where a direct action is permitted.</p>

            <p>In the latter connection, it must be observed that, by virtue of Article 18 of Directive 2009/103, it is for the Member States to ensure that any party injured as a result of an accident caused by a vehicle covered by civil liability insurance enjoys a direct right of action against the insurance undertaking covering the person responsible against civil liability.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules: Article 9(1)(b) of Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters, read together with Article 11(2) thereof, must be interpreted as meaning that an employer, established in one Member State, which continued to pay the salary of its employee absent as the result of a road traffic accident and to which have passed the employee's rights with regard to the company insuring the civil liability resulting from the vehicle involved in that accident, which is established in a second Member State, may, in the capacity of `injured party', within the meaning of Article 11(2), sue the insurance company before the courts of the first Member State, where a direct action is permitted.</p>
