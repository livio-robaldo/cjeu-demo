            <p>In November 2007, Ms Pflanz, who does not hold the authorisation for providing financial services pursuant to Article 32(1) of the KWG, recommended to Mr Khorassani an investment called the `Grand-Slam'. In that context, she advised him to sign a service agreement with GSS AG, and a portfolio management agreement with D. AG as well, both of these companies being established in Liechtenstein. It is apparent from the order for reference that the latter contract provides for the purchase and sale as well as the management of financial instruments constituting a finance portfolio management activity.</p>

            <p>Mr Khorassani committed himself to a one-off payment of EUR 20000 and to monthly instalment payments of EUR 1000, each with a 5% premium. In December 2007 the applicant paid EUR 27000 in total, from which the amount of EUR 19731.60 was deducted as an administration charge to be paid in advance and the amount of EUR 1285.71 was deducted as a premium. Mr Khorassani subsequently cancelled the agreements and sought repayment of the amounts paid and damages.</p>

            <p>The Landgericht Berlin (Regional Court, Berlin, Germany) ruled the action brought against the two undertakings established in Liechtenstein inadmissible on the grounds that it lacked international jurisdiction, and held that the action brought against Ms Pflanz was unfounded.</p>

            <p>After he obtained repayment in the amount of EUR 6803.03, Mr Khorassani's appeal seeking repayment of the remainder of the amounts claimed was dismissed by the Kammergericht Berlin (Higher Regional Court, Berlin, Germany). That court considered that Ms Pflanz had not provided financial services within the meaning of points 1 and 1a of the second sentence of Paragraph 1(1a) of the KWG, for which an authorisation must be held pursuant to Paragraph 32(1) of the KWG, as both the investment advice and the investment brokering provided by her did not relate to a transaction involving the purchase and sale of financial instruments but rather an asset management agreement which, whilst serving subsequently as a basis for the purchase and the sale of specific financial instruments, was not itself a financial instrument. That court accordingly found that Mr Khorassani was not entitled to damages under the combined provisions of Article 823(2) of the BGB and Article 32(1) of the KWG.</p>

            <p>The Bundesgerichtshof (Federal Court of Justice, Germany), before which an action in revision (appeal on a point of law) was brought, considers that the Kammergericht Berlin (Higher Regional Court, Berlin) was correct in holding that Ms Pflanz had not provided Mr Khorassani with investment advice within the meaning of point 1a of the second sentence of Paragraph 1(1a) of the KWG since, pursuant to Article 4(1)(4) of Directive 2004/39, read in conjunction with Article 52 of Directive 2006/73, that provision covers the provision of personal recommendations in relation to specific financial instruments and not portfolio management activities.

            <p>The referring court observes, in relation to the overall scheme of Directive 2004/39, that the clarifications given for the definition of `investment advice' in recital 81 and Article 52 of Directive 2006/73 tend to support the abovementioned restrictive interpretation, as those clarifications state that investment advice must relate to `particular' (specific) financial instruments, which could be based on general legal reasoning that is also applicable to investment brokering activities.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, Article 21 of that directive concerns, as evidenced by its title, the obligation to execute orders on terms most favourable to the client, which includes, as provided for in paragraph 1 thereof, obtaining the best possible result for their clients taking into account price, costs, speed, likelihood of execution and settlement. Under Article 21(2) and (3), in particular Member States are to require investment firms to establish and implement an order execution policy that includes, for each category of instruments, information on the different systems in which the investment firm executes its clients' orders and the factors influencing the choice of execution system.</p>

Even if the conclusion of that contract may subsequently serve as a basis for the reception and transmission of order for the purchase or sale of financial instruments by the portfolio manager as part of its management activities, the purpose of the contract itself is not the reception or transmission of orders.</p>

            <p>The German and United Kingdom Governments further observe that `investment advice', defined in Article 4(1)(4) of Directive 2004/39 and listed in point 5 of Section A of Annex I thereto, consists, according to the wording of Article 52 of Directive 2006/73, in recommending the completion of a transaction in relation to a particular financial instrument. They infer therefrom that the lack of reference to a `particular' financial instrument in point 1 of Section A of Annex I to Directive 2004/39 indicates that the scope of that provision is not limited to the reception and transmission or orders relating directly to a particular financial instrument.</p>

            <p>According to the definition set out in Article 4(1)(4) Directive 2004/39, `investment advice' consists in the provision of personal recommendations to a client in relation to transactions involving financial instruments. Recital 81 of Directive 2006/73 states that generic advice about a type of financial instrument is not investment advice for the purposes of Directive 2004/39, which advice must be restricted to advice on particular financial instruments, and this clarification is implemented in Article 52 of Directive 2006/73. Neither that recital nor that article has any bearing whatsoever on the scope of `investment service' referred to in point 1 of Section A of Annex I to Directive 2004/39.</p>
