Aid to such undertakings should therefore be excluded from the scope of this Regulation. In order to reduce the administrative burden for Member States, when granting aid covered by this Regulation to SMEs [small and medium-sized enterprises], the definition of what is to be considered an undertaking in difficulty should be simplified as compared to the definition used in those Guidelines. Moreover, SMEs which have been incorporated for less than three years should not be considered, for the purposes of this Regulation, to be in difficulty with regard to that period, unless they fulfil the criteria under the relevant national law for being the subject of collective insolvency proceedings. That simplification should be without prejudice to the qualification of those SMEs under those Guidelines with regard to aid not covered by this Regulation and without prejudice to the qualification as undertakings in difficulty of large enterprises, under this Regulation, which remain subject to the full definition provided in those Guidelines. ...</p>

            <p>Points 9 to 11 of the Community guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty ( OJ 2004 C 244, p. 2, `the Guidelines') provide: `9. There is no Community definition of what constitutes ``a firm in difficulty ''. However, for the purposes of these Guidelines, the Commission regards a firm as being in difficulty where it is unable, whether through its own resources or with the funds it is able to obtain from its owner/shareholders or creditors, to stem losses which, without outside intervention by the public authorities, will almost certainly condemn it to going out of business in the short or medium term. 10. In particular, a firm is, in principle and irrespective of its size, regarded as being in difficulty for the purposes of these Guidelines in the following circumstances:</p>
            <blockList>
              <item>
                <num>(a)</num>
                <p>in the case of a limited liability company, where more than half of its registered capital has disappeared and more than one quarter of that capital has been lost over the preceding 12 months;</p>

              <item>
                <num>(b)</num>
                <p>in the case of a company where at least some members have unlimited liability for the debt of the company, where more than half of its capital as shown in the company accounts has disappeared and more than one quarter of that capital has been lost over the preceding 12 months;</p>

                <p>whatever the type of company concerned, where it fulfils the criteria under its domestic law for being the subject of collective insolvency proceedings. 11. Even when none of the circumstances set out in point 10 are present, a firm may still be considered to be in difficulties, in particular where the usual signs of a firm being in difficulty are present, such as increasing losses, diminishing turnover, growing stock inventories, excess capacity, declining cash flow, mounting debt, rising interest charges and falling or nil net asset value. In acute cases the firm may already have become insolvent or may be the subject of collective insolvency proceedings brought under domestic law. In the latter case, these Guidelines apply to any aid granted in the context of such proceedings which leads to the firm's continuing in business. In any event, an undertaking in difficulty is eligible only where, demonstrably, it cannot recover through its own resources or with the funds it obtains from its owners/shareholders or from market sources.'</p>

            <p>It must be observed, as a preliminary point, that the referring court asks the Court of Justice about the interpretation of Article 1(7)(c) of Regulation No 800/2008 since it is dealing with a dispute in which Nerea, an undertaking which is the recipient of State aid granted under an ROP for the</p>

            <p>It is clear from the order for reference that that question arises on account of the specific nature of the collective insolvency proceedings at issue in the main proceedings, that is an arrangement with creditors as a going concern as provided for by the Law on bankruptcy, which is opened by the competent court at the request of the undertaking concerned.</p>

            <p>If the concept of `collective insolvency proceedings' was to be interpreted as covering only the proceedings opened by the competent court of its own motion, it would not cover the arrangement with creditors as a going concern and Article 1(6) and (7) of Regulation No 800/2008 would therefore not apply to Nerea's situation.</p>

            <p>30 By its second question, the national court asks essentially whether Article 1(7)(c) of Regulation No 800/2008 must be interpreted as meaning that the fact that an undertaking satisfies the criteria for being subject to collective insolvency proceedings is sufficient to prevent it from receiving State aid under that regulation or to require that aid to be withdrawn if it has already been granted, or whether it must be actually established for that purpose that the undertaking is in difficulty.</p>

            <p>Therefore, as the Advocate General noted essentially in point 71 of his Opinion, it is at that time that the undertaking's eligibility to receive aid must be assessed, with regard to the conditions laid down by Regulation No 800/2008 (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 March 2013, Magdeburger Mühlenwerke, C‑129/12, EU:C:2013:200, paragraph 40).</p>

            <p>It must then be noted, as is clear from recital 15 of Regulation No 800/2008, that the definition of what is to be considered an `undertaking in difficulty' should be simplified as compared to the definition used in the Guidelines in order to reduce the administrative burden for Member States when granting aid covered by this regulation to SMEs. Consequently, Article 1(7) of Regulation No 800/2008 simply reproduces the information about the concept of `undertaking in difficulty' set out in point 10 of the Guidelines, but does not reproduce those set out in point 11 thereof.</p>

            <p>It would be contrary to the objective of simplification to require the competent authorities of the Member States, in order to decide whether to grant State aid to an undertaking in accordance with Regulation No 800/2008, to determine themselves specifically, when they assess its eligibility, whether that undertaking is in difficulty.</p>

            <p>Moreover, Article 1(7)(c) of that regulation does not impose on the authorities the obligation to carry out an independent examination of the undertaking's actual situation, but merely to ensure not to grant aid to an undertaking which satisfies the criteria for being subject to collective insolvency proceedings in accordance with that regulation.</p>
