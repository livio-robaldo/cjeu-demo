            <p>It is necessary, as a preliminary matter, to examine whether Regulation No 2201/2003 applies to the determination of the competent jurisdiction in a situation such as that in the main proceedings.

            <p>In that regard, the Court has already held in the judgment of 6 October 2015, Matoušková ( C‑404/14, EU:C:2015:653, paragraph 31), that the fact that a measure -- such as the approval from the court dealing with guardianship matters of an agreement on the sharing out of an estate concluded in the name of minor children -- has been requested in succession proceedings cannot be regarded as decisive as to whether that measure should be classified as falling within the law on succession. The need to obtain approval from the court dealing with guardianship matters is a direct consequence of the status and capacity of the minor children and constitutes a protective measure for the child relating to the administration, conservation or disposal of the child's property in the exercise of parental responsibility within the meaning of Article 1(1)(b) and 2(e) of Regulation No 2201/2003.</p>

            <p>By its question, the referring court asks in essence whether, in a situation such as that in the main proceedings, where the parents of a minor child, who are habitually resident with the latter in a Member State, lodged, in the name of that child, an application for authorisation to renounce an inheritance before the court of another Member State, Article 12(3)(b) of Regulation No 2201/2003 must be interpreted as meaning that the prorogation of jurisdiction in favour of the court of that other Member State complies with the terms of that provision and, in particular, the best interests of the child, where that application was jointly lodged by the parents of that child before that court, the prosecutor, who is legally a party to the procedure in question according to the applicable national law, has not objected to that prorogation of jurisdiction, and the residence of the deceased and location of his assets, at the time of his death, was in that other Member State.</p>

            <p>It is necessary, however, to find that, where both parents of a minor child make a joint application to the same court, they demonstrate their willingness to seise that court and, in so doing, their agreement with the choice of court having jurisdiction. In the absence of other facts contradicting that finding, that agreement must be regarded as `unequivocal', within the meaning of Article 12(3)(b) of Regulation No 2201/2003.</p>

            <p>As regards the terms `all the parties to the proceedings at the time the court is seised', it is necessary to examine whether the prosecutor, who is legally a party to the proceedings under national law, is also a `party' within the meaning of Article 12(3)(b) of Regulation No 2201/2003. The referring court states that the prosecutor acts as a representative of the State and in the general interest and that, in the case of an application for authorisation to renounce an inheritance on behalf of a minor child, the general interest coincides with that of the child.</p>

            <p>In addition, it must be recalled, having regard to recital 12 of Regulation No 2201/2003, that the head of jurisdiction provided for in Article 12(3) is an exception to the criterion of proximity, under which it is in the first place for the courts of the Member State of the child's habitual residence to hear actions concerning parental responsibility for that child, and of which Article 8(1) of the regulation is an expression. That exception is intended to allow the parties a certain autonomy in matters of parental responsibility by emphasising that the condition as to the unequivocal nature of the acceptance of jurisdiction of the courts seised by all the parties to the proceedings must be interpreted strictly (judgment of 21 October 2015, Gogova, C‑215/15, EU:C:2015:710, paragraph 41).</p>

            <p>As the Advocate General observed in point 46 of his opinion, it must be noted that the use of the word `all' in the phrase `all the parties to the proceedings', must be compared with the more precise term of `spouses' or `the holders of parental responsibility' that are found in Article 12(1) of Regulation No 2201/2003. The EU legislature thus took care to use a term that encompassed all the parties to the proceedings, within the meaning of national law.</p>

            <p>It must therefore be held that a prosecutor who, according to the national law, has the capacity of a party to the proceedings in actions such as that in the main proceedings and who represents the interests of the child, is a party to the proceedings within the meaning of Article 12(3)(b) of Regulation No 2201/2003.

            <p>As regards the date at which the parties acceptance of the proceeding must be given, namely the date on which the court is seised, Article 16 of Regulation No 2201/2003 states that that date corresponds, in principle, to when the document instituting the proceedings or an equivalent document is lodged with the court (judgments of 1 October 2014, E, C‑436/13, EU:C:2014:2246, paragraph 38, and of 12 November 2014, L, C‑656/13, EU:C:2014:2364, paragraph 55).</p>

            <p>Facts arising after the date on which the court is seised may nevertheless demonstrate that the acceptance required under Article 12(3)(b) of Regulation No 2201/2003 was lacking at that date. Thus, in the judgment of 12 November 2014, L ( C‑656/13, EU:C:2014:2364, paragraphs 56 and 57), the Court held that the existence of an express or at least unequivocal agreement within the meaning of that provision manifestly cannot be established where the court in question is seised on the initiative of only one of the parties to the proceedings and, later, another party to those proceedings, on taking the first step required of him in the first proceedings, pleads the lack of jurisdiction of the court seised.</p>

            <p>Similarly, in a situation where a prosecutor is regarded, under the applicable national law, as having the capacity of a party to a procedure in matters of parental responsibility, the opposition, made by that party as regards the choice of jurisdiction made by the parents of the child in question after the date on which the court was seised, precludes the acceptance of prorogation of jurisdiction by all the parties to the proceedings at that date from being established. However, in the absence of such opposition, the agreement of that party may be regarded as implicit and the condition of the unequivocal acceptance of prorogation of jurisdiction by all the parties to the proceedings at the date on which that court was seised, may be held to be satisfied.</p>
