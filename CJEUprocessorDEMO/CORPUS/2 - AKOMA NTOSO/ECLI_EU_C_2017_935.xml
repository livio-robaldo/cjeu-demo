On the basis of [Articles 91 and 171 TFEU] the Union has adopted a substantial number of legal instruments applicable to rail transport. Under Union law, the Union has acquired exclusive competence in matters of rail transport where the [COTIF] or legal instruments adopted pursuant to it may affect or alter the scope of these existing Union rules. For subject matters governed by the Convention in relation to which the Union has exclusive competence, Member States have no competence. Where Union rules exist but are not affected by the [COTIF] or legal instruments adopted pursuant to it, the Union shares competence on matters in relation to [COTIF] with Member States. A list of the relevant Union instruments in force at the time of the conclusion of the Agreement is contained in the Appendix to this Annex. The scope of the Union competence arising out of these texts has to be assessed in relation to the specific provisions of each text, especially the extent to which these provisions establish common rules. Union competence is subject to continuous development. In the framework of the Treaty on European Union and the TFEU, the competent institutions of the Union may take decisions which determine the extent of the competence of the Union. The Union therefore reserves the right to amend this declaration accordingly, without this constituting a prerequisite for the exercise of its competence in matters covered by [COTIF].'</p>

Those proposals for modifications concerned, in particular, Appendix B to the COTIF on Uniform Rules concerning the Contract of International Carriage of Goods by Rail (CIM) ( `Appendix B (CIM)'), Appendix D to the COTIF on Uniform Rules concerning Contracts of Use of Vehicles in International Rail Traffic (CUV) ( `Appendix D (CUV)'), in conjunction with Article 12 of the COTIF, and Appendix E to the COTIF on Uniform Rules concerning the Contract of Use of Infrastructure in International Rail Traffic (CUI) ( `Appendix E (CUI)').

On the conclusion of working sessions which took place within its preparatory bodies, the Council, at its meeting on 24 June 2014, adopted the contested decision, establishing the position to be adopted on behalf of the European Union as regards, in particular, proposals for amendment of Article 12 of the COTIF and Appendices B (CIM), D (CUV) and E (CUI) of the COTIF (together, `the amendments at issue').</p>

CIM), Appendix D ( ... CUV) and Appendix E ( ... CUI) to the [COTIF], and, consequently, that there is no need to coordinate an EU position at the 25th session of the OTIF Revision Committee, to take place from 25 to 27 June 2014. To date, [the European Union] has not exercised its legislative competence in the areas of private law concerning contracts of carriage governed by those Appendices. Member States may therefore continue to exercise their competence in accordance with the second sentence of Article 2(2) [TFEU]. Moreover, in cases where competence is shared, Article 6(2) [of the accession agreement] explicitly provides that Member States may continue to vote independently in those areas. [The Federal Republic of Germany] hereby asserts, as a precaution, that it rejects any casting of its vote by the European Commission.'</p>

Competence: shared Exercising voting rights: Union for Articles 6 and 6a. Member States for other Articles. Recommended coordinated position: Amendments to Article 6 and new Article 6a concern Union law because of the use of the consignment note and its accompanying documents for customs and sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) procedures. The Union agrees with the intention of OTIF to give priority to the electronic form of consignment notes. However, at present the adoption of these amendments may lead to unintended consequences. The current simplified procedure for customs transit by rail is only possible with paper documents. Therefore, if railways opt for the electronic consignment note, they will have to use the standard transit procedure and the New Computerised Transit System (NCTS). The Commission has started preparations for a working group to discuss the use of electronic transport documents for transit under Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and the Council [of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code ( OJ 2013 L 269, p. 1)]. That working group will have its kick-off meeting on 4-5 June 2014. The Union agrees also with the intention to provide the accompanying documents in electronic format. However, under current Union law there is no legal basis to provide the documents (e.g. Common Veterinary Entry Document, Common Entry Document) which have to accompany SPS-related goods in electronic format and therefore they need to be provided on paper. The Commission has prepared a draft Regulation, which will cater for electronic certification and the draft is currently under discussion in the European Parliament and the Council. That Regulation (Official Control Regulation) is envisaged to be adopted by end of 2015/beginning of 2016, however, there will be a transitional period for the enforcement. Therefore, the Union suggests that no decision should be taken on these items at the present session of the [Revision Committee] and that OTIF continue cooperation with the Union on this issue in order to have a well‑prepared solution for an upcoming revision of CIM which should ideally be synchronised with the Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 and its implementing provisions which are to be in force from 1 May 2016. Certain electronic procedures may be phased in between 2016 and 2020 in accordance with Article 278 of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013. ...'</p>

Recommended Union position: Amendments to Articles 2 and 9 to be supported as they clarify the roles of the keeper and of the entity in charge of maintenance in line with Union law (Directive 2008/110/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council [of 16 December 2008 amending Directive 2004/49/EC on safety on the Community's railways (Railway Safety Directive) ( OJ 2008 L 345, p. 62)]. However, the proposed amendment to Article 7 submitted by [the French Republic] concerning the liability of the person who has provided a vehicle for use as a means of transport in case of damage resulting from a defect of the vehicle needs further analysis within the Union before taking a decision in OTIF. Therefore, the Union is not in a position to support this amendment proposal at this [session of the OTIF Revision Committee] and proposes to postpone the decision until the next General Assembly in order to further assess this issue. The Union takes the same position, i.e. to postpone the decision until the next General Assembly in order to further assess the issue, on the proposal of [the Federal Republic of Germany] for a new Article 1a presented to OTIF during Union coordination. Additional recommended Union position: In document CR 25/7 ADD 1, page 6, at the end of paragraph 8a, add: ``The amendment to Article 9, paragraph 3, first indent, does not affect the existing allocation of liabilities between [the entity in charge of maintenance] and the keeper of the vehicles ''.'</p>

The French Republic considers that, in the present case, no guidance can be obtained from the former judgment, since, in that judgment, the Court took into consideration the specific features of the area of the environment, where the Treaties have conferred an explicit external competence on the Union.

            <p>First, it must be borne in mind that the first sentence of Article 5(1) TEU states that `the limits of Union competences are governed by the principle of conferral'. Article 5(2) TEU states, on the one hand, that, `under [that principle], the Union shall act only within the limits of the competences conferred upon it by the Member States in the Treaties to attain the objectives set out therein', and, on the other, that `competences not conferred on the Union in the Treaties remain with the Member States'. It follows from the Court's case-law that that principle must be observed with respect to both the internal and international action of the European Union (Opinion 2/94(Accession of the Community to the ECHR) of 28 March 1996, EU:C:1996:140, paragraph 24).</p>

            <p>As the Court has stated, in particular, in Opinion 1/03 ( New Lugano Convention) of 7 February 2006 ( EU:C:2006:81, paragraph 114), the competence of the European Union to conclude international agreements may arise not only from an express conferment by the Treaties, but may equally flow implicitly from other provisions of the Treaties and from measures adopted, within the framework of those provisions, by the EU institutions. In particular, whenever EU law creates for those institutions powers within its internal system for the purpose of attaining a specific objective, the Union has the competence to undertake international commitments necessary for the attainment of that objective even in the absence of an express provision to that effect. The last-mentioned possibility is now referred to in Article 216(1) TFEU (Opinion 1/13(Accession of third States to the Hague Convention) of 14 October 2014, EU:C:2014:2303, paragraph 67 and the case-law cited).</p>

In its judgment of 31 March 1971, Commission v Council ( 22/70, EU:C:1971:32, paragraphs 26 and 27), the Court stated, specifically in that field, that that provision which is also concerned with transport to and from third countries - as regards that part of the journey that takes place on EU territory - and which thus is based on the assumption that the European Union's competence extends to relationships that are subject to international law, meaning that agreements with the third countries concerned are therefore necessary in the field in question.</p>

The question that arose in the case that led to that judgment related, as is apparent from paragraphs 34 and 35 of that judgment, not to the existence of an external European Union competence in the area of the environment, but to whether, in the specific field covered by a provision of a mixed agreement, the Union had exercised its powers and had adopted provisions to implement obligations that derived from it.</p>

A clear demarcation of competences is particularly important in cases of mixed agreements, first, due to the fact that the provisions of such agreements are applicable both within EU law and within national law and, second, in order to determine the competences of the various participants within the bodies of international organisations.

That obligation, which is justified in particular by the need for the Court to be able to exercise its power of judicial review, must apply to all European Union acts that produce legal effects (judgment of 25 October 2017, Commission v Council (WRC‑15), C‑687/15, EU:C:2017:803, paragraph 52).</p>

            <p>The Court has also held that the requirement of legal certainty means that the binding nature of any act intended to have legal effects must be derived from a provision of EU law which prescribes the legal form to be taken by that act and which must be expressly indicated therein as its legal basis (judgments of 1 October 2009, Commission v Council, C‑370/07, EU:C:2009:590, paragraph 39, and of 25 October 2017, Commission v Council (WRC‑15), C‑687/15, EU:C:2017:803, paragraph 53).</p>

            <p>Moreover, it is clear from equally settled case-law of the Court that the alleged failure to refer to a specific provision of the Treaty, such as in this case Article 216(1) TFEU, as raised by the Federal Republic of Germany, does not constitute an infringement of essential procedural requirements if the legal basis for a measure may be determined from other parts of the measure, provided that the parties concerned and the Court are not left uncertain as to the specific legal basis (see, to that effect, judgment of 25 October 2017, Commission v Council (WRC‑15), C‑687/15, EU:C:2017:803, paragraph 55 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It must, first, be stated that since the contested decision makes explicit reference to Article 91 TFEU, the Council correctly stated, in that decision, the substantive legal basis for it. In so far as the argument of the Federal Republic of Germany relies on the claim that Article 91 TFEU cannot be capable of conferring an external competence on the Union, suffice it to state that that argument relates to the question whether a competence actually exists and cannot therefore be validly relied on in support of a plea in law alleging a breach of the obligation to state reasons.</p>

            <p>Moreover, while Article 216(1) TFEU does indeed list the various situations in which the European Union has the power to conclude an international agreement, that provision does not, unlike Article 352 TFEU, prescribe any formal or procedural requirements for doing so. The form of the act and the procedure to be followed must, therefore, be determined by reference to the other provisions of the Treaties.</p>

In the case which gave rise to that judgment, the Council had failed to indicate the substantive and procedural legal basis for the contested measure, and there was nothing in that measure from which that legal basis could be inferred.</p>

Accordingly, those institutions should arrange the procedure for the adoption of a legal instrument in such a way as to ensure that a Member State that challenges the competence of the European Union may bring proceedings before the Court sufficiently early to permit clarification on the question of competence to be obtained.</p>

            <p>The Council, supported by the Commission, argues that it was impossible for it to begin or to finish its work earlier. Most of the working documents containing the proposed amendments on the agenda of the 25th session of the OTIF Revision Committee were sent by the OTIF Secretary-General on 25 April 2014. Some documents were received on 6 and 12 May 2014, and a proposal of the Federal Republic of Germany in relation to Appendix D (CUV) was received on 3 June 2014. The Commission submitted, on 26 May 2014, to the appropriate Council working group, an initial working document setting out possible approaches towards achieving a coordinated Union position. The work undertaken within that working group was continued on 5 and 16 June 2014, on the basis of a proposal for a decision that the Commission had meantime sent. That proposal, after it was approved on 17 June 2014 by the Permanent Representatives Committee, was adopted by the Council on 24 June 2014, that is, in good time, before the opening of the 25th session of the OTIF Revision Committee, on 25 June 2014.</p>

            <p>The Council states that the period of one month at the end of which it completed the decision-making process constitutes an extremely short period for dealing with complex technical and legal issues. In the course of that process, the Council, with the assistance of the Commission, discussed in as much detail as possible its position with the delegations, particularly in order to convince the Federal Republic of Germany that the European Union had the required competence, with respect to the agenda items at the 25th session of the OTIF Revision Committee, on the subject of which that Member State had expressed doubts. Accordingly, the Council did everything in its power to ensure that the adoption of the European Union position was with due regard to the principle of sincere cooperation.</p>

            <p>Further, the insistence of the Federal Republic of Germany that the European Union position ought to have been adopted sufficiently early to permit it to request that the Court suspend the implementation of the contested decision is inordinate and unrealistic.

            <p>Moreover, the Council states that no irreversible effect of the contested decision with respect to the Federal Republic of Germany can be identified, since, in accordance with the applicable rules, the amendments examined in the course of the 25th session of the OTIF Revision Committee either were not definitively adopted at that session, or, if they were adopted, have not yet entered into force. In addition, according to the same rules, the entry into force of those amendments could be prevented in the case of objection by one quarter of the Member States of the OTIF. In any event, if the Court were to annul the contested decision, the Council would be obliged, pursuant to Article 266(1) TFEU, to take the necessary measures to comply with the judgment of the Court. Such compliance is possible given that the Union controls a majority of votes within the OTIF.</p>

            <p>It is apparent, in this case, that the discussions which took place within the Council working group, with a view to the establishment of a Union position, began on 26 April 2014, namely the day after that on which most of the documents had been sent by the OTIF Secretary-General, and the discussions continued at the following two meetings, on the basis of the Commission's proposal for a decision. Further, the progress of the procedure, as described by the Council and summarised in paragraph 100 of the present judgment, indicates that the Council began preliminary discussions with a view to the adoption of a Union position without waiting for all the working documents drawn up for the 25th session of the OTIF Revision Committee to be sent to it. The four meetings of the appropriate Council working group and of the Permanent Representatives Committee were devoted to, inter alia, clarification of the allocation of the respective powers of the European Union and the Member States with respect to the items on the agenda of the 25th session of the OTIF Revision Committee, on the subject of which the Federal Republic of Germany had expressed its reservations. Last, the Federal Republic of Germany has not established that the period of one week that elapsed between the approval of the proposal for a decision by the Permanent Representatives Committee and the adoption of the contested decision by the Council was so unwarranted as to call into question the fulfilment, by that institution, of its duty of sincere cooperation with the Member States.</p>

It has to be said, however, that, in any event, that argument is based on a mistaken premiss. That Member State has not demonstrated that, during that session, the contested decision produced such effects, nor has it rebutted the arguments relied on in its defence by the Council on this subject, as summarised in paragraph 103 of the present judgment.
