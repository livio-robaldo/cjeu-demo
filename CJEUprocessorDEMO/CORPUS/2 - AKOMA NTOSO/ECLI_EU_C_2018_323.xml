            <p>In the appeal which it brought against that decision before the referring court, the Verwaltungsgericht Berlin (Administrative Court, Berlin, Germany), Evonik Degussa claims, in essence, that the production of hydrogen by purification of rich gases ought to have been taken into account for the allocation of allowances. To that end, it relies in particular on the wording of the product benchmark for hydrogen and the definition of that product set out in Annex I, Part 2, to Decision 2011/278. It argues that it is not apparent from that definition that, in order to be regarded as `hydrogen' within the meaning of that product benchmark, the gas concerned should not be the result of a process of adsorption or purification, but of a direct chemical reaction.</p>

            <p>Recital 13 of Decision 2013/448 and recital 5 of Decision 2011/278, according to which the product benchmarks are established for a certain product and not on the basis of the processes used to obtain it, are said to support that interpretation. Similarly, a document issued by the Commission shows that the processes of adsorption and of purifying gases fall within the system boundaries defined by the product benchmark for hydrogen listed in Annex I, Part 2, to Decision 2011/278. Accordingly, the method of pressure-swing adsorption used by Evonik Degussa for the extraction of hydrogen contained in a rich gas mixture should be classified as a similar process to the chemical synthesis of hydrogen.</p>

Although the measures thus adopted seek, as described in that latter provision, to amend the non-essential elements of Directive 2003/87 by supplementing it, the fact remains that the Commission was obliged, in that context, to respect the legal framework thus established by that directive (see, to that effect, judgment of 26 July 2017, Czech Republic v Commission, C‑696/15 P, EU:C:2017:595, paragraph 51), including, in particular, its scope.

As confirmed by all the observations submitted to the Court, `production of hydrogen' within the meaning of Annex I to Directive 2003/87 has such a potential because of the intensity of the emissions of greenhouse gases generated by that activity.

Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Sixth Chamber) hereby rules: Annex I, Part 2, to Commission Decision 2011/278/EU of 27 April 2011 determining transitional Union-wide rules for harmonised free allocation of emission allowances pursuant to Article 10a of Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council must be interpreted as meaning that a process, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which does not produce hydrogen by chemical synthesis, but only isolates hydrogen already contained in a gas mixture, does not fall within the system boundaries of the product benchmark for hydrogen. It would be otherwise only if that process, first, is associated with `production of hydrogen' within the meaning of Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC, as amended by Directive 2009/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009 and, second, have a technical connection with it.</p>
