            <p>However, neither the wording of Articles 76, 78 and 81 of Regulation No 555/2008 nor that of the other provisions of that regulation provides that the obligation on the Member States to introduce a system of on-the-spot checks includes an authorisation, for the officials empowered for that purpose, to enter agricultural land without having obtained the vine grower's permission.</p>

            <p>In particular, it cannot be inferred from the fact that, in accordance with Article 78(1) of Regulation No 555/2008, on-the-spot checks must be unannounced that that regulation provides for such authorisation. As observed by the Advocate General in points 40 to 42 of his Opinion, the words `unannounced' and `unauthorised' are not synonymous. The fact that a check can be carried out unannounced means at the very most that it can take place at any time, without the control official having given notice of his visit.</p>

          <content eId="para_18689__content">
            <p>By contrast, the fact that the check is `unannounced' cannot mean that, once the official is in situ without having given prior notice, that official can claim that he has the right to enter the place where the check is to be carried out without having been authorised to do so by the vine grower. It follows that the obligation of the Member States imposed by Regulation No 555/2008 to introduce a system of unannounced checks does not in itself entail the right of control officials to enter the place where the check is to be carried out without the vine grower's permission.</p>

            <p>This analysis is supported by the general scheme of the regulation. In that regard, recitals 72 and 73 of the regulation state that it is for the Member States to ensure the effectiveness of the work of the bodies responsible for wine-sector controls, taking the necessary steps to ensure that the staff of those bodies has adequate powers of investigation to guarantee compliance with the rules. In addition, as observed by the Advocate General in point 43 of his Opinion, Article 83(a) of that regulation, concerning the powers of control officials, provides that each Member State must ensure that its officials have access to vineyards and other places and installations necessary for them to carry out their duties, without, however, requiring that it be possible to gain such access without the vine grower's permission.</p>

            <p>It follows that Regulation No 555/2008 gives the Member States responsibility for regulating, under their national law, the powers granted to control officials as well as the greater part of the rules governing the checks to be carried out, including those relating to access to the places to be subjected to checks.</p>

            <p>However, the French Government and the European Commission essentially take the view that, when they apply for EU funding under the support programmes referred to in Regulations No 479/2008 and No 555/2008, vine growers implicitly authorise checks generally and in advance, as those checks form an integral part of the aid scheme established by those regulations.</p>

            <p>According to the Court's settled case-law, protection against arbitrary or disproportionate intervention by public authorities in the sphere of the private activities of any natural or legal person constitutes a general principle of EU law; such intervention must have a legal basis and must be justified on the grounds laid down by law (see, to that effect, judgments of 21 September 1989, Hoechst v Commission, 46/87 and 227/88, EU:C:1989:337, paragraph 19; of 22 October 2002, Roquette Frères, C‑94/00, EU:C:2002:603, paragraph 27, and of 16 May 2017, Berlioz Investment Fund, C‑682/15, EU:C:2017:373, paragraph 51).</p>

            <p>Implicit, general authorisation granted in advance, as envisaged by the French Government and the Commission, does not satisfy that requirement. Even though EU law can provide for the possibility of general authorisation to enter agricultural land being granted in advance by the vine grower to control officials, such authorisation should, at the very least, be expressly provided for by law. However, Regulations No 479/2008 and No 555/2008 do not provide for such authorisation.</p>

            <p>In any event, the Court finds that the rejection of the aid application provided for in Article 78(3) of Regulation No 555/2008, as a serious legal consequence if vine growers or their representatives prevent the carrying-out of the on-the-spot check, is in itself an effective and sufficient way to achieve the objective, referred to in Article 76 of that regulation, of providing adequate protection for the financial interests of the European Union (see, by analogy, judgment of 16 June 2011, Omejc, C‑536/09, EU:C:2011:398, paragraphs 26 and 27). In order to attain that objective, general authorisation to access the place where the checks are to be carried out, granted in advance to control officials, is therefore unnecessary.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby rules: Articles 76, 78 and 81 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 555/2008 of 27 June 2008 laying down detailed rules for implementing Council Regulation (EC) No 479/2008 on the common organisation of the market in wine as regards support programmes, trade with third countries, production potential and on controls in the wine sector, must be interpreted as not authorising officials carrying out an on-the-spot check to enter agricultural land without having obtained the vine grower's permission.</p>
