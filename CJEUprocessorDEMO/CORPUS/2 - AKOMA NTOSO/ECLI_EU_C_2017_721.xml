            <p>By letter of formal notice of 23 November 2009, the Commission informed the Federal Republic of Germany that it had doubts as to the compatibility of the German rules on the exemption from VAT of the supply of services by independent groups of persons (IGPs) carrying on an activity which is exempt from VAT or in relation to which they are not taxable persons, for the purpose of rendering their members the services directly necessary for the exercise of that activity.</p>

            <p>The Commission stated in that letter that German law restricted that exemption to the supply of services provided by IGPs which carry on activities or professions in the health sector, whereas Directive 2006/112 does not restrict the exemption in question to groups of specific professional categories, but grants that exemption to groups of all persons if they are exempt from VAT or are not taxable persons in relation to the activity which they carry on. The Commission therefore considered that German law on turnover tax was incompatible with the objectives of the VAT Directive.</p>

            <p>The Federal Republic of Germany replied to the letter of formal notice by letter of 22 March 2010. In that letter, it confirmed that the German rules exempted the supply of services by IGPs only if they were provided by groups of doctors, by persons exercising paramedical professions, or by groups of hospitals or establishments of a similar nature. It asserted that the restriction was justified because it was for the national legislature to examine which professions could benefit from the exemption in question without causing distortion of competition.</p>

            <p>On 7 April 2011, the Commission issued a reasoned opinion to the Federal Republic of Germany. In that reasoned opinion, the Commission expressed doubts as to the Federal Republic of Germany's assertion that, in order to avoid distortion of competition, health activities and professions alone could benefit from the exemption in question. Furthermore, the Commission maintained that, on a number of occasions, German courts should have extended the scope of the exemption in question to professions other than those specified in German Law on turnover tax.</p>

            <p>The Commission also stated that it did not understand on what basis the German legislature saw persistent distortions of competition if, in addition to the already exempt health professions, it were to grant the exemption in question to all sectors of the German economy. It maintained that the German legislature was not required to assess distortions of competition on the basis of a general analysis, but, to the contrary, that the exemption in question should be refused only if there was a genuine risk that the exemption may by itself, immediately and in the future, give rise to distortions of competition.</p>

In that letter, it emphasised, first, the position occupied by the provision laying down the exemption in question in the scheme of the VAT Directive, namely in the chapter on exemptions for certain activities in the public interest. It concluded that the exemption could not be extended to all economic activities.</p>

            <p>First, the Federal Republic of Germany argues that it follows from the wording and position of Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112 in the latter together with its historical context and the objectives it pursues, that the ratione personae of the exemption at issue is restricted to groups of persons carrying on certain activities in the public interest.</p>

            <p>First of all, as regards the wording and position, the Federal Republic of Germany points out that that exemption appears in Article 132 of Directive 2006/112, in Chapter 2 thereof, entitled `Exemptions for certain activities in the public interest'. It follows that the exemption laid down in Article 132(1)(f) concerns only supplies of services by IGPs whose members carry on activities in the public interest.</p>

If that were not the case, the legislature would have placed the exemption at the end of Article 132 of Directive 2006/112 or in a separate article.</p>

            <p>The interpretation according to which the exemption at issue concerns the activities mentioned in Article 132(1)(b) to (e) of Directive 2006/112 is supported by the use that Court made of the term `professionals' in its interpretation of that exemption of the judgment of 11 December 2008, Stichting Centraal Begeleidingsorgaan voor de Intercollegiale Toetsing ( C‑407/07, EU:C:2008:713, paragraph 37).

            <p>Next, the Federal Republic of Germany submits that its arguments are confirmed by the historical background to Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112. In that connection, it points out, inter alia that in the first version of the Sixth Directive the combined provisions of Article 28(3)(a) and point 3 of Annex E sought to ensure that the exemption laid down in Article 13A(1)(f) for the supply of services by IGPs of a medical or paramedical nature was applicable, while the Member States could continue to tax similar supplies of services by other IGPs until 31 December 1989. The removal of that possibility with effect from 1 January 1990 has not changed the scope of the exemption at issue, but is aimed more at eliminating certain difficulties of a purely practical nature, outside the system of VAT.</p>

          <content eId="para_19518__content">
            <p>Second, the Federal Republic of Germany asserts that the German legislation at issue is justified in light of the condition that the exemption at issue applies only if it is not likely to cause distortions of competition. It argues, contrary to the Commission's claims, that the national legislature may have recourse to an assessment by professional category of the risk of distortions of competition existing within certain professional categories and, thereby, restrict the exemption at issue to certain categories.</p>

The Commission has failed to establish that an exemption for the supply of services by IGPs to their members does not lead to distortions of competition in sectors other than the sector in which the professions are covered by the UStG.</p>

In the alternative, the Commission maintains that, even if that provision only covers IGPs whose members carry on activities in the public interest, its scope is not limited to IGPs whose members exercise professions in the health sector as provided by the German legislation at issue.</p>

            <p>That exemption refers to `the supply of services by independent groups of persons, who are carrying on an activity which is exempt from VAT or in relation to which they are not taxable persons'. In addition to the transactions carried out in the health sector, Directive 2006/112 envisages other exempt transactions in the public interest, such as transactions related to welfare and social security, education, sport and culture, laid down in Article 132(1)(g), (i), (m) and (n) respectively of Directive 2006/112.</p>

            <p>Second, according to the case-law of the Court, the purpose of the exemption laid down in Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112 is `to create an exemption from VAT in order to avoid an entity offering certain services from being required to pay that tax when it has found it necessary to cooperate with other entities by means of a common structure set up to undertake activities essential to the provision of those services' (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 December 2008, Stichting Centraal Begeleidingsorgaan voor de Intercollegiale Toetsing, C‑407/07, EU:C:2008:713, paragraph 37).</p>

          <content eId="para_19540__content">
            <p>However, contrary to the Federal Republic of Germany's arguments, the use by the Court of the term `professional' in its interpretation of that exemption does not support its arguments that that exemption only covers IGPs whose members are active in the health sector. As regards Article 132 of Directive 2006/112, `professions' or `profession' are only employed in paragraph 1(c) and 1(e) thereof and, therefore, the use of those terms does not lead to the conclusion that the exemption laid down in Article 132(1)(f) covers only IGPs whose members are active in the health sector.</p>

          <content eId="para_19541__content">
            <p>Third, it cannot be inferred from the legislative history of Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112 that the exemption laid down in that provision is limited to the health sector. It is true that, historically, Article 13A(1)(f) of the Sixth Directive, read together with Article 28(3)(a) and Annex E thereof, provided for the possibility to limit the exemption concerned to IGPs of a medical or paramedical nature.</p>

          <content eId="para_19542__content">
            <p>However, the fact that the Sixth Directive provided for the possibility of derogating from that exemption only for IGPs other than those of a medical or paramedical nature indicates, contrary to the Federal Republic of Germany's arguments, that the scope of that exemption also covers IGPs whose members are active in sectors other than that of health. In any event, the possibility to derogate from the exemption in Article 13 A(1)(f) of the Sixth Directive was abolished with effect from 1 January 1990 by Article 1 of the Eighteenth Directive 89/465. It follows that, contrary to the Federal Republic of Germany's arguments, that exemption is not limited to IGPs of a medical or paramedical nature.</p>

            <p>Having regard to the foregoing considerations, the complaint relied on by the Commission in the alternative, that the scope of the exemption laid down in Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112 is not limited to IGPs whose members exercise professions only in the health sector, as provided for by the German legislation at issue, must be accepted.</p>

            <p>According to the Federal Republic of Germany, it is for the national legislature to determine the sectors of activity which may benefit from the exemption at issue without causing distortion of competition.

            <p>Therefore, it is appropriate to examine whether a Member State may, having regard to the conditions relating to the absence of distortion of competition, restrict the sectors of activity to which the exemption laid down in Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112 applies by means of national legislation.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, it must be observed that the Member States are not obliged to transpose that criterion literally into their national law (see, by analogy, as regards Article 4(5) of the Sixth Directive, judgment of 17 October 1989, Commune di Carpaneto Piacentino and Others, 231/87 and 129/88, EU:C:1989:381, paragraph 23).</p>

            <p>Furthermore, in order to determine whether the application of the exemption mentioned in Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112 to a specific activity is likely to cause distortion of competition, it is certainly possible for the national legislature to lay down rules which are easily managed and supervised by the competent authorities (see, by analogy, judgment of 24 February 2015, Sopora, C‑512/13, EU:C:2015:108, paragraph 33). Under Article 131 of Directive 2006/112, Member States are to lay down conditions to which the exemptions are subject for the purposes of ensuring the correct and straightforward application of those exemptions and of preventing any possible evasion, avoidance or abuse. However, those conditions do not concern the definition of the content of the exemptions laid down by that directive (see, to that effect, judgments of 21 March 2013, Commission v France, C‑197/12, not published, EU:C:2013:202, paragraph 31, and 25 February 2016, Commission v Netherlands, C‑22/15, not published, EU:C:2016:118, paragraphs 28 and 29).</p>

            <p>That is precisely the effect of the German legislation at issue, by which the national legislature excluded all the services supplied by IGPS whose members carry on activities in the public interest, with the exception of IGPs whose members are active in the health sector.</p>

            <p>Contrary to the Federal Republic of Germany's claims, it does not follow from the judgment of 16 September 2008, Isle of Wight Council and Others ( C‑288/07, EU:C:2008:505), that the assessment of the conditions relating to the absence of distortion of competition allows the exemption in Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112 to be limited, in a general manner to the level of national legislation. In that judgment, the Court interpreted a different provision from that at issue, namely Article 4(5), second subparagraph, of the Sixth Directive, according to which bodies governed by public law are to be considered taxable persons where treatment as non-taxable persons would lead to significant distortions of competition. In that context, the Court held, in paragraph 40 of that judgment that the treatment of bodies governed by public law as taxable persons, in accordance with that provision, results from the carrying-on, as such, of a given activity, irrespective of whether or not those bodies face competition at the level of the local market on which they engage in that activity. However, it does not follow that the condition relating to the absence of distortion of competition, mentioned in Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112 allow the scope of that exemption to be limited in a general manner.</p>

            <p>As the Federal Republic of Germany observed, the assessment of the condition relating to the absence of distortion of competition may be complex.

            <p>As the Advocate General observed in points 119 and 120 of his Opinion, as regards IGPs whose members are active in the health sector, German legislation requires an examination on a case-by-case basis by the tax authorities of that condition. It follows that the Federal Republic of Germany itself considers that such an assessment by the tax authorities is possible in the health sector. However, it has not shown how the examination of that condition relating to the absence of distortions of competition is different in sectors other than the health sector.</p>

On those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby 1. Declares that by restricting the value added tax exemption to independent groups of persons whose members exercise a limited number of professions, the Federal Republic of Germany has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 132(1)(f) of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax; 2.
