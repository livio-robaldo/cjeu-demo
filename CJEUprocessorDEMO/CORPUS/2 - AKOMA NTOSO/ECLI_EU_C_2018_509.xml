            <p>In support of its opposition based on Article 8(5) of Regulation No 207/2009, Puma relied on the reputation of the earlier trade marks in all the Member States and for all the goods listed in paragraph 14 above.</p>

            <p>On 10 March 2014, the Opposition Division of EUIPO ( `the Opposition Division') rejected the opposition in its entirety. Having found that there was a certain degree of similarity between the signs at issue, it took the view -- with regard to the reputation of earlier trade mark No 593987 -- that, for reasons of procedural economy, it was not necessary to examine the evidence which Puma had filed in order to prove the extensive use and reputation of that trade mark and that the examination of the opposition would be carried out on the assumption that the earlier trade mark had `enhanced distinctiveness'. Starting from that premiss, it concluded, however, that the relevant public would not establish a link between the marks at issue, as required by Article 8(5) of Regulation No 207/2009, due to the differences between the goods covered by each of those marks.</p>

            <p>By the decision at issue, the Board of Appeal dismissed the appeal. First, it found that there was a certain degree of visual similarity between the earlier trade marks and the trade mark applied for and that they conveyed the same concept of a `pouncing feline recalling a puma'. Secondly, the Board of Appeal, nevertheless, rejected Puma's argument that the Opposition Division had confirmed that the earlier trade marks had a reputation, on the ground that the Opposition Division had, in fact, limited itself to stating that, for reasons of procedural economy, the evidence of reputation filed by Puma did not have to be assessed in the present case and that the examination would proceed on the assumption that earlier trade mark No 593987 had `enhanced distinctiveness'. The Board of Appeal also examined and rejected the evidence of the reputation of the earlier trade marks regarding the goods referred to in paragraph 14 above. Thirdly, the Board of Appeal found that, even assuming that the reputation of the earlier marks were to be regarded as proven, the opposition based on Article 8(5) of Regulation No 207/2009 would have to fail because the other conditions, namely the existence of an unfair advantage taken of the distinctive character or the repute of the earlier marks or of detriment to their distinctive character or repute, had also not been satisfied.</p>

            <p>The General Court went on to state in paragraph 30 of the judgment under appeal that, by three decisions of 20 August 2010, 30 August 2010 and 30 May 2011 ( `the three previous decisions), EUIPO concluded that the earlier marks had a reputation and were widely known to the public. In that same paragraph, the General Court outlined the essential content of the decisions and the evidence presented by Puma in the proceedings which led to those decisions. In paragraph 31 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court observed that those decisions, which were duly relied on by Puma in the proceedings before the Board of Appeal, were nonetheless not examined or even mentioned in the decision at issue, as the Board of Appeal merely stated that EUIPO was not bound by its previous decision-making practice.</p>

            <p>Thus, the General Court considered, first, that the earlier trade marks had been found to have a reputation by EUIPO in the three previous decisions, borne out by a number of decisions from national offices adduced by Puma and, secondly, that that finding was a finding of a factual nature which did not depend on the trade mark applied for.</p>

            <p>In paragraph 34 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court drew the following conclusion: `... in light of the case-law ... according to which EUIPO must take into account the decisions already taken in respect of similar applications and consider with especial care whether it should decide in the same way or not, and in the light of its obligation to state reasons, the Board of Appeal could not depart from EUIPO's decision-making practice without providing the slightest explanation regarding the reasons which led it to take the view that the factual findings in respect of the reputation of the earlier marks, which were made in those decisions, would not, or would no longer, be relevant. The Board of Appeal in no way states that that reputation has become weaker since the abovementioned recent decisions were made or that that decision-making practice may be unlawful.'</p>

            <p>In that regard, the General Court rejected EUIPO's argument that those decisions did not have to be taken into account since none of them was accompanied by the evidence of the earlier marks' reputation which had been submitted in the relevant proceedings. The General Court explained that, when examining an appeal directed against a decision of the Opposition Division, the Board of Appeal enjoys the discretion, under the third subparagraph of Rule 50(1) of Regulation No 2868/95, to decide whether or not to take into account additional or supplementary facts and evidence which were not presented within the time limits set or specified by the Opposition Division.</p>

            <p>In view of the circumstances of the case, the General Court made the following observation in paragraph 37 of the judgment under appeal: `... in the light of its recent previous decision-making practice, which is borne out by a relatively high number of national decisions and by a judgment of the General Court, the Board of Appeal should, in accordance with the principle of sound administration ... have either requested that the applicant submit supplementary evidence of the reputation of the earlier marks -- if only to rebut it -- as the third subparagraph of Rule 50(1) of Regulation No 2868/95 enabled it to do, or provided the reasons why it took the view that the findings made in those previous decisions as regards the reputation of the earlier marks had to be discounted in the present case. That was particularly necessary because some of those decisions referred in a very detailed manner to the evidence on which the assessment of the reputation of the earlier marks in those decision was based, which should have drawn the Board of Appeal's attention to the existence of that evidence.'</p>

            <p>In the first part of its first ground of appeal, EUIPO alleges that the General Court infringed Article 76(1) of Regulation No 207/2009 and the principle of sound administration. Having found that Puma `duly relied on' the three previous decisions in support of its opposition, the General Court implicitly, but necessarily, accepted that a general and imprecise reference to the findings of those decisions and to the evidence submitted by Puma in those previous proceedings involving different parties amounted to reliable evidence of reputation, for the purposes of Rule 19(2)(c) of Regulation No 2868/95.</p>

            <p>EUIPO states that reputation is not a fact which produces effects erga omnes, but a finding limited to the parties to the proceedings in question and to the aims of those proceedings, so that EUIPO's previous decisions declaring that a mark has a reputation cannot, in themselves, constitute evidence of reputation in subsequent proceedings. Any reference to such decisions may thus be interpreted correctly only as a general and imprecise reference to the documents produced in the previous proceedings before EUIPO, and if EUIPO's duty of neutrality in inter partes proceedings, laid down in Article 76(1) of Regulation No 207/2009, and the principle of sound administration are not to be prejudiced, such a reference may not be admitted as reliable evidence of reputation, contrary to the view taken by the General Court. In the absence a precise identification by the opponent of the evidence on which it intends to rely, it is impossible for EUIPO to guarantee the rights of defence of the party applying to register a sign as a mark.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the General Court's finding disregards the adversarial principle and the principle of equality of arms between the parties in inter partes proceedings, in that it falls to the opponent, and not EUIPO, to give the trade mark applicant the opportunity to assess and, if necessary, challenge the factual basis used for the adoption of previous decisions. Moreover, EUIPO states that, in the present case, its inability to identify the relevant documents was not of a `physical' nature, but was rather the result of the fact that, in the absence of a clear and specific reference to the evidence which Puma intended to rely on, it was required to search actively for the relevant documents in order find proof of reputation. Thus Puma's argument, presented for the first time before the Court of Justice, that all the documents submitted in the previous proceedings are in any case accessible online, is not only incorrect, but also irrelevant, even if it were held to be admissible.</p>

            <p>On the basis of that first error in law, the General Court's interpretation of the decision at issue was manifestly wrong in that it considered that the previous decisions were not `even mentioned' in the decision at issue, whereas they were included in the summary of Puma's arguments, and were examined directly by the Board of Appeal in relation to the fact that they lacked any legally binding force, and in the Board of Appeal's reasoning included for the sake of completeness.</p>

It submits that that finding of the General Court is based on two erroneous premisses, the first of which consisted in acknowledging that it was acceptable to rely on those previous decisions, which was not the case, as was demonstrated by the arguments relied on in the first part of the first ground of appeal.</p>

            <p>The second erroneous premiss is the General Court's recognition of the existence of EUIPO's `decision-making practice' having found that the earlier marks had a reputation, inasmuch as that recognition disregarded the notion of `reputation' and the relative nature of the ground for refusal of registration under Article 8(5) of Regulation No 207/2009, and the adversarial nature of the proceedings provided for in Article 76(1) of that regulation.</p>

            <p>Even where, as in the present case, the opponent relies on marks which have been recognised previously as having a reputation by EUIPO, it is still required to challenge the applications to register subsequent marks on a case-by-case basis by establishing in each case the reputation of the marks which it relies on. The reputation of an earlier mark depends, not only on the evidence presented by the proprietor of that mark, but also on the counter-arguments presented by the other party to the proceedings.</p>

            <p>Consequently, the finding of reputation cannot be regarded as a mere finding of fact, which is essentially static, as the General Court wrongly held in paragraph 33 of the judgment under appeal. On the contrary, although it does not strictly depend on the mark applied for, such a finding is subject to the application of the adversarial principle in each individual set of opposition proceedings. In the present case, the General Court's assessment that the three previous decisions constituted a `decision-making practice' was tantamount to recognising the existence of a `presumption of reputation' which infringes Article 76(1) of Regulation No 207/2009, read in conjunction with Article 8(5) of that regulation.</p>

It is difficult to consider that the act of relying on those three previous decisions merely amounts to a general reference to the documentation produced in the earlier proceedings, when these are definitive decisions made by an administrative authority, recognising the reputation of the marks identified with precision in the notice of opposition, which are published and easily accessible on the EUIPO website, and the relevant passages of which were summarised in that notice in the language of the case. Such decisions thus constitute, in themselves, invaluable and conclusive evidence of the reputation of the earlier marks. Moreover, reputation is an objective fact with an erga omnes effect, and if the only circumstance capable of influencing that reputation is the passage of time, EUIPO provided no analysis in that regard.</p>

It is clear from the wording, the context and the purpose of that provision that it applies only to the facts relied on and to the evidence presented by the parties on their own initiative. Likewise, it would not be possible to apply that provision by analogy to a situation such as the one in the present case, bearing in mind that there is a specific legal basis for that type of application, namely Article 78(1)(c) of Regulation No 207/2009.

That obligation, which also stems from Article 75 of Regulation No 207/2009, has the dual purpose of enabling interested parties to know the purported justification for the measure taken so as to be able to defend their rights and of enabling the Courts of the European Union to exercise their jurisdiction to review the legality of the decision in question (see, to that effect, judgments of 10 May 2012, Rubinstein and L'Oréal v OHIM, C‑100/11 P, EU:C:2012:285, paragraph 111, and of 17 March 2016, Naazneen v OHIM, C‑252/15 P, EU:C:2016:178, paragraph 29).</p>

The General Court went on to note in paragraph 33 of the judgment under appeal that the reputation of the earlier marks had been established by EUIPO in those three previous decisions which were borne out by a number of national decisions concerning the same earlier marks, goods that were identical or similar to those at issue and some of the Member States concerned by the present case, adding that the finding that the earlier marks had a reputation was a finding of a factual nature which did not depend on the mark applied for.</p>

            <p>Finally, in so far as EUIPO claims that the General Court wrongly found in paragraph 31 of the judgment under appeal that the three previous decisions were `not examined or even mentioned' in the decision at issue, suffice it to state that that line of argument does not succeed, since the General Court's finding cannot be regarded as running counter to the content of that decision.</p>

            <p>Although it is true that in the part of the decision at issue entitled `Submissions and arguments of the parties', the Board of Appeal indicated that Puma had raised the argument that the reputation of the earlier marks had been recognised `in numerous Office decisions', the fact remains that the Board of Appeal failed to cite from among the `evidence submitted by the opponent' the three previous decisions and that, in the part of that decision entitled `Reasons', it neither mentioned nor analysed those decisions with regard to their content or their probative value in relation to the possible reputation of the earlier marks, whereas it did do that in relation to a number of decisions of the national offices.</p>

            <p>In view of all the foregoing considerations, it must be concluded that the General Court did not disregard Article 76(1) of Regulation No 207/2009 or the principle of sound administration, read in conjunction with Rule 19(2)(c) of Regulation No 2868/95 and Article 8(5) of Regulation No 207/2009, in holding that the Board of Appeal, by merely stating that, in circumstances such as those of the present case, the lawfulness of EUIPO's decisions must be assessed solely on the basis of Regulation No 207/2009, as interpreted by the European Union Courts, and not on the basis of an earlier decision-making practice of EUIPO or of the national offices, had disregarded the principle of sound administration, in particular the obligation to state reasons for its decisions, and thus rendered the decision at issue unlawful.</p>

            <p>By the third part of the first ground of appeal and by the second ground of appeal, which should be examined together, EUIPO alleges that the General Court infringed Article 76(1) of Regulation No 207/2009, read in conjunction with the principle of sound administration, and Article 76(2) of that regulation, read in conjunction with Rule 50(1) of Regulation No 2868/95, by holding in paragraph 37 of the judgment under appeal that, in the circumstances of the case, the Board of Appeal should have invited Puma to submit supplementary evidence of the reputation of the earlier marks -- if only to refute that evidence -- as it was permitted to do by the third paragraph of Rule 50(1) of Regulation No 2868/95.</p>

            <p>EUIPO argues, in particular, that such an interpretation of those provisions and principles infringes the adversarial principle, as expressed in Article 76(1) of Regulation No 207/2009 in relation to inter partes proceedings before EUIPO, and disregards the fact that EUIPO's obligation to exercise its discretion to decide whether or not to take into account facts and evidence submitted late applies only to the facts and evidence presented by the parties on their own initiative.</p>

            <p>Thus, by its line of argument, EUIPO in essence criticises the General Court for having transformed the Board of Appeal's discretion under Article 76(2) of Regulation No 207/2009, read in conjunction with Rule 50(1) of Regulation No 2868/95, to decide whether to take into account supplementary facts and evidence which were not presented within the time limits set by the Opposition Division, into an obligation, with that obligation, in EUIPO's opinion, also being wrongly extended to the facts and evidence which the parties did not submit of their own initiative.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it is clear from paragraph 35 of the judgment under appeal that EUIPO argued before the General Court that the Board of Appeal was not required to take into account the three previous decisions on the ground that Puma had not provided the Opposition Division with the evidence of the reputation of the earlier marks produced in the proceedings which led to those decisions being adopted. According to EUIPO, Puma should have lodged that evidence again or referred to it in a precise manner.</p>

            <p>In reply to that line of argument, the General Court, in paragraph 36 of the judgment under appeal, correctly referred to the case-law according to which Article 76(2) of Regulation No 207/2009 and the third subparagraph of Rule 50(1) of Regulation No 2868/95 grant EUIPO the discretion to decide whether or not to take into account additional or supplementary facts and evidence which were not presented within the time limits set or specified by the Opposition Division. In accordance with those provisions, when evidence is produced within the time limit set by EUIPO, as it is agreed to be in the present case, the production of supplementary evidence remains possible (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 July 2016, EUIPO v Grau Ferrer, C‑597/14 P, EU:C:2016:579, paragraph 26 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>However, by stating in paragraph 37 of the judgment under appeal that `in the circumstances of the present case, in the light of its recent previous decision-making practice, which is borne out by a relatively high number of national decisions and by a judgment of the General Court, the Board of Appeal should, in accordance with the principle of sound administration ... have ... requested that the applicant submit supplementary evidence of the reputation of the earlier marks -- if only to rebut it -- as the third subparagraph of Rule 50(1) of Regulation No 2868/95 enabled it to do', the General Court did not rely on Article 76(2) of Regulation No 207/2009 and the third subparagraph of Rule 50(1) of Regulation No 2868/95, but on the principle of sound administration.</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is clear from paragraphs 30, 33 and 37 of the judgment under appeal that, in the notice of opposition, the substantive content of the three previous decisions was set out by Puma in the language of the case, such that it must be considered that that content was made known to the Opposition Division and the Board of Appeal, and to Gemma Group.</p>

            <p>It is also clear from paragraph 30 of the judgment under appeal that, in the three previous decisions, the competent EUIPO bodies had established that one of the earlier marks had been found, `on the basis of a large number of items of evidence', to have a `substantial reputation, at least in France' and that one of them was also considered `in the light of the extensive evidence provided,' to have acquired `a substantial reputation through use in the European Union', enjoying a `high degree of distinctiveness as a result of its ``long standing and intensive use '' and ``high degree of recognition '''. The General Court also established that some of those decisions described in great detail the evidence which had led to the conclusion that the earlier marks had a reputation.</p>

          <content eId="para_15228__content">
            <p>In that context, the three previous decisions, in so far as they had recognised the reputation of the earlier marks, were a strong indication, in the opposition proceedings at issue, that those marks could also be regarded as having a reputation for the purposes of Article 8(5) of Regulation No 207/2009, as has already been stated in paragraph 81 above.</p>

            <p>Therefore, as has already been held in paragraph 76 above, EUIPO was required to take into account the three previous decisions relied on by Puma and had to provide an explicit statement of its reasoning in the present case in so far as it had decided to depart from the approach adopted in those decisions on the reputation of the earlier marks.</p>

            <p>That being so, if the Board of Appeal itself were to reach the conclusion that it could not satisfy its obligations arising from the principle of sound administration and, in that context in particular, its obligation to state reasons, recalled in paragraph 66 above, without the evidence which had been lodged in the earlier proceedings before EUIPO, it must be considered, as the General Court did, that it would have been necessary for the Board to exercise its power to request the production of that evidence for the purposes of exercising its discretion and carrying out a full examination of the opposition.</p>

In turn, such provisions demonstrate the possibility of seeing the underlying facts of a dispute multiply at various stages of the proceedings before EUIPO (judgments of 13 March 2007, OHIM v Kaul, C‑29/05 P, EU:C:2007:162, paragraph 58, and of 28 February 2018, mobile.de v EUIPO, C‑418/16 P, EU:C:2018:128, paragraph 57).</p>

            <p>In the light of that case-law and the case-law recalled in paragraph 91 above, according to which, when evidence is produced within the time limit set by EUIPO, the production of supplementary evidence remains possible, an obligation, such as the one established by the General Court in paragraph 37 of the judgment under appeal pursuant to the principle of sound administration, cannot be regarded as running counter to the provisions of Regulation No 207/2009.</p>
