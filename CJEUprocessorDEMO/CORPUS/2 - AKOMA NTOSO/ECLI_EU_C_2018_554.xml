            <p>The MISE is competent to inspect that type of apparatus in Italy. During an inspection carried out on 18 May 2011, it noted that there was no indication of the identification number of a notified body as referred to in Directive 1999/5 either on the specimens of the apparatus bearing that mark being offered for sale to the public or on their packaging, but only in the user manual supplied with the apparatus.</p>

            <p>The MISE, considering that that indication needed to be displayed on the apparatus itself in order to comply with the requirements laid down by Directive 1999/5 and by Legislative Decree No 269/2001 transposing that directive into Italian law, carried out an administrative seizure of the apparatus which it considered irregular and imposed a fine on COBRA. In addition, by decision of 22 June 2011, it ordered that company to bring both the seized specimens and the specimens which had already been placed on the Italian market back into compliance.</p>

            <p>COBRA brought an action against that decision before the Tribunale amministrativo regionale per il Lazio (Regional Administrative Court, Lazio, Italy), arguing that that decision was based on an incorrect reading of Directive 1999/5, in particular the second paragraph of Annex III thereto. That court dismissed the action, holding that Directive 1999/5 and Legislative Decree No 269/2001 require that an indication of the notified body responsible for ensuring that checks for compliance have been carried out in the proper way be provided on the apparatus bearing the trade mark Pascal in question. COBRA then brought an appeal on a point of law before the Consiglio di Stato (Council of State, Italy) in which it once again argued that the decision at issue was contrary to Directive 1999/5.</p>

            <p>The Consiglio di Stato (Council of State) finds that the apparatus concerned falls within the scope of Directive 1999/5 on the ground that it is radio equipment as referred to in Article 10(4) of that directive. It states that, according to Article 5 of that directive, the essential requirements referred to in Article 3 thereof are presumed to be fulfilled for goods meeting the harmonised standards. It also notes that there is a seeming inconsistency in Directive 1999/5 concerning the compliance of radio equipment with the essential requirements set out in Article 3 of that directive. According to the second subparagraph of Article 12(1) of that directive, apparatus complying with all the essential requirements is to bear the EC conformity marking referred to in Annex VII thereto, but that provision also states that, where the procedure identified in Annex III to that directive is used, that marking must be accompanied by the identification number of the notified body. On the other hand, according to the Consiglio di Stato (Council of State), it is apparent from Annex III to that directive that, where the essential radio test suites to be carried out have been defined in the harmonised standards, it is not necessary for the CE marking to be accompanied by the identification number of the notified body.</p>

It maintains that such an approach is supported by the Commission's guidelines regarding the interpretation of Directive 1999/5, which state that, when harmonised standards indicate all the essential technical tests for radio equipment, a manufacturer who complies with those standards does not need to provide an indication of the identification number of a notified body on the product concerned.</p>

            <p>It should be pointed out, in the first place, that it is not clear from the order for reference what procedure was used by the appellant in the main proceedings to assess the compliance of the apparatus at issue with the essential requirements set out in Article 3 of Directive 1999/5. However, the second question raised by the referring court is based on the premiss that a manufacturer has made use of a notified body, albeit solely for the purpose of confirming the list of essential radio test suites to be carried out within the framework of harmonised standards. It is therefore necessary to answer the referring court on the basis of that premiss, while leaving it to that court to verify whether that premiss is accurate.</p>

            <p>28 By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the second subparagraph of Article 12(1) of Directive 1999/5 is to be interpreted as meaning that, where a manufacturer of radio equipment makes use of the procedure laid down in the second paragraph of Annex III to that directive and uses the harmonised standards in order to define the test suites referred to in that paragraph, he is required to consult a notified body as referred to in Article 11(1) of that directive and, consequently, must ensure that the CE marking is accompanied by the identification number of that notified body.</p>

Consequently, based solely on the wording of that annex, that assessment procedure does not call, in all circumstances, for the involvement of a notified body, whether in the identification of the essential radio test suites, or in order to carry out those test suites.</p>

            <p>In that regard, Article 10 of Directive 1999/5 lays down assessment procedures for establishing the conformity of apparatus with those essential requirements, as set out in Article 3 thereof. Article 10 of that directive provides, in paragraph 4 thereof, that, where a manufacturer has applied the harmonised standards, radio equipment is to be subject to the assessment procedures described in any one of Annexes III, IV or V thereto at the choice of the manufacturer. However, as has been noted in paragraph 34 above, the assessment procedure described in Annex III to that directive does not call for the involvement of a notified body in all circumstances.</p>

            <p>In addition, Article 5(1) of Directive 1999/5 provides that, where apparatus meets the `harmonised standards', defined in Article 2(h) of that directive as `technical specification[s] adopted by a recognised standards body ... for the purpose of establishing a European requirement, compliance with which is not compulsory', there is also a consequent presumption of compliance with the essential requirements.</p>

            <p>That presumption is borne out both by recital 27 of Directive 1999/5, which provides that `compliance with ... harmonised standards gives rise to a presumption of conformity to the essential requirements' and that `other means of demonstrating conformity to the essential requirements are permitted', and by Annex III to that directive, which exempts the manufacturer from using a notified body for the procedure laid down therein where the conformity of the apparatus has been assessed using the harmonised standards.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, that interpretation of the second subparagraph of Article 12(1) of Directive 1999/5 and Annex III thereto is consistent with the objective pursued by that directive. It follows from recitals 14 and 32 of Directive 1999/5 that that directive is intended to guarantee the free movement of goods by limiting impediments to such free movement to national requirements that are necessary and proportionate, while ensuring that the radio equipment does not represent an avoidable hazard to health.</p>

            <p>In that regard, under Article 1 thereof, Directive 1999/5 thus establishes a regulatory framework for the placing on the market, free movement and putting into service in the European Union of such equipment. For its part, Article 7 of that directive provides that the Member States are to allow the putting into service of that equipment for its intended purpose where it `complies with the ... essential requirements'. Those requirements are defined in Article 3 of Directive 1999/5 and include, in particular, the protection of the health and the safety of the user.</p>

            <p>As has been stated in paragraphs 39 and 40 above, Article 5 of Directive 1999/5 establishes a presumption that the essential requirements set out in Article 3 thereof are met where apparatus complies with the harmonised standards. Accordingly, in such a situation, the involvement of a notified body is not necessary in order to ensure that that equipment does not represent an avoidable hazard to health and is thus also not necessary in order to protect the health and the safety of the user.</p>

          <content eId="para_16186__content">
            <p>That interpretation is borne out by the fact that the role of the notified body, as defined in Article 11(1) of Directive 1999/5, is merely to carry out `the relevant tasks' included in the assessment procedures laid down in Article 10 of that directive, and not to certify the compliance of all apparatus with the essential requirements set out in Article 3 thereof.</p>

            <p>Moreover, in addition to the analysis of the wording and context of the second subparagraph of Article 12(1) of Directive 1999/5 and the intended purpose of that directive, the interpretation set out in paragraph 35 above is supported by the Commission's guidelines regarding the interpretation of Directive 1999/5. In the section entitled ` Ambiguity in Annex III to the Directive', it is apparent from those guidelines that, when harmonised standards indicate all the essential technical radio test suites for radio equipment, a manufacturer who complies with those standards is not obliged to provide an indication of the identification number of a notified body on that equipment. Those guidelines emphasise that a notified body is not to be involved in the conformity assessment procedure described in Annex III to Directive 1999/5 where a manufacturer uses the harmonised standards and that, accordingly, the obligation set out in the second subparagraph of Article 12(1) of that directive does not apply where that manufacturer has used the harmonised standards.</p>
