According to the Commission, that infringement, in which 17 undertakings had participated, took place over various periods between 16 October 1992 and 9 November 2004.

            <p>As regards the Roca group's participation in the infringement found, the Commission considered that the group had been aware that the infringement covered the three product sub-groups. However, so far as the geographic scope of the cartel was concerned, the Commission concluded that the Roca group could not be considered to have been aware of the cartel's overall scope but was to be regarded as having been aware only of the collusive conduct in France and Austria. So far as Roca itself was concerned, its participation was said to be limited to France and to taps and fittings and ceramics.</p>

            <p>The Commission first determined the basic amount of the fine. To this end it explained that this amount was based, for each undertaking, on its sales by Member State, multiplied by the number of years of participation in the infringement found in the Member State in question for the relevant product group, so that account was taken of the fact that certain undertakings were active only in certain Member States or that their activities concerned only one of the three product sub-groups.</p>

            <p>After giving that explanation, the Commission set at 15% of the value of sales the multiplier linked to the gravity of the infringement found, as provided for in points 20 to 23 of the 2006 Guidelines ( `the multiplier for the ``gravity of the infringement ''').

            <p>In addition, the Commission, under point 24 of the 2006 Guidelines, set the multiplier to be applied -- to take account of the duration of the infringement found -- to the basic amount determined for Roca, at 1.83, which reflected participation in the infringement, in France, in respect of taps and fittings for the period from 10 December 2002 to 9 November 2004, and at 0.66, which reflected participation in the infringement, in France, with regard to ceramics, for the period from 25 February to 9 November 2004.</p>

            <p>As regards the complaint that the General Court distorted the facts in finding, in paragraph 131 of the judgment under appeal, that Roca, because of its membership of the Roca group, was aware of the material scope of the infringement, which concerned the three product sub-groups, it should be recalled that, given the exceptional nature of a complaint that there has been a distortion of the facts and the evidence, Article 256 TFEU, Article 58, first paragraph, of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union and Article 168(1)(d) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court require, in particular, that an appellant indicate precisely the evidence alleged to have been distorted by the General Court and show the errors of appraisal which, in its view, led to that distortion. Such distortion must be obvious from the documents on the Court's file, without there being any need to carry out a new assessment of the facts and evidence (order of 7 May 2015, Adler Modemärkte v OHIM, C‑343/14 P, not published, EU:C:2015:310, paragraph 43 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>First, it should be stated that the General Court, in making the finding in paragraph 131 of the judgment under appeal, in no way distorted the decision at issue, but took as its basis recital 870 of the decision.</p>

            <p>Second, the appellant has not shown that the General Court had distorted the facts and evidence in the file. In that regard, it fell to Roca to establish that it was not aware of the material scope of the infringement concerned. However, Roca, at the stage of the appeal, merely makes an assertion to that effect but has put forward no evidence in support thereof.</p>

            <p>Roca maintains, in essence, first, that paragraphs 116 to 145 of the judgment under appeal are vitiated by an error of law. It submits that the General Court did not act upon its finding that the participation in the infringement that was imputed to Roca was of lesser gravity than that of other members of the cartel and should, in particular, have</p>
            <blockList>
              <item>

                <num>(ii)</num>
                <p>reduced the basic amount of the fine. Roca argues in this respect that the judgment under appeal drew no distinction -- other than with regard to the geographic extent of the involvement of the participants in the infringement -- between the gravity of its conduct and the gravity of the conduct of the undertakings making up the `hard core' of participating undertakings, in order to reflect the nature of their respective actions. In accordance with the principle of non-discrimination, the General Court should -- by applying to Roca lower multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount' than those applied to those core undertakings -- have reduced the basic amount of the fine imposed, particularly since the General Court itself, in paragraphs 139, 247 and 248 of the judgment under appeal, had recognised that the lesser gravity of Roca's conduct should have been reflected through the application of such multipliers. However, the General Court did not take account of the lesser gravity of Roca's participation in the infringement as compared with that of other participants, either by adjusting the multipliers or by taking account of mitigating circumstances.</p>

            <p>Second, Roca submits that, failing any adjustment of the multipliers, the lesser gravity of its participation in the infringement should have been taken into account as a mitigating circumstance as referred to in point 29 of the 2006 Guidelines. However, in paragraphs 141 to 143 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court, on the basis of an over-restrictive and incorrect interpretation of that provision, did not allow any reduction of the fine on this account.</p>

            <p>The Commission disputes the appellant's arguments. Furthermore, whilst it considers that the General Court was correct in rejecting Roca's arguments concerning infringement of the principles of equal treatment and proportionality, it submits, in essence, that the premiss accepted by the General Court -- that the multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount' applied to Roca, which participated only in the French aspect of the infringement, should have been different from those used for other cartel members which had participated in the infringement in six Member States and in relation to three product sub-groups -- was incorrect. The Commission therefore requests the Court of Justice to replace the relevant grounds of the judgment under appeal.</p>

            <p>It must first of all be recalled that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to examine how in each particular case the Commission assessed the gravity of unlawful conduct.

            <p>In so far as Roca, by its second ground of appeal, complains that the General Court failed -- both in carrying out its review of the legality of the decision at issue (in paragraphs 116 to 145 of the judgment under appeal) and in exercising its unlimited jurisdiction as regards the setting of the fine (in paragraphs 247 to 249 of that judgment) -- to take account of the fact that its participation in the infringement was of lesser gravity than that of the undertakings making up the `hard core' of the cartel, it should be noted that it is not for the Court of Justice, when ruling on questions of law in the context of an appeal, to substitute, on grounds of fairness, its own assessment for that of the General Court exercising its unlimited jurisdiction to rule on the amount of fines imposed on undertakings for infringements of EU law (judgments of 28 June 2005, Dansk Rørindustri and Others v Commission, C‑189/02 P, C‑202/02 P, C‑205/02 P to C‑208/02 P and C‑213/02 P, EU:C:2005:408, paragraph 245, and of 11 July 2013, Gosselin Group v Commission, C‑429/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:463, paragraph 87).</p>

            <p>In the first place, the General Court confirmed, in paragraph 131 of the judgment under appeal, that the constituent elements of the infringement, on which the Commission relied, were factually correct. It thereby found that Roca participated in an infringement consisting in coordinating future price increases and that, because of its participation in the Roca group, it was aware of the material scope of the infringement as well as its geographic scope. The General Court thus concluded that the Commission was, in accordance with points 21 to 23 and 25 of the 2006 Guidelines, fully entitled to consider that multipliers of 15% for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount' were appropriate.</p>

Such an infringement is among the most harmful restrictions of competition for the purposes of points 23 and 25 of the 2006 Guidelines and 15% is the lowest rate on the scale of penalties prescribed for such infringements under those guidelines (see, to that effect, judgments of 11 July 2013, Ziegler v Commission, C‑439/11 P, EU:C:2013:513, paragraphs 124 and 125, and of 11 July 2013, Team Relocations and Others v Commission, C‑444/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:464, paragraph 125).</p>

            <p>As regards the determination of the multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount', it is apparent from points 22 and 25 of the 2006 Guidelines that account must be taken of a number of factors, in particular those set out in point 22 of those guidelines. Although, in order to assess the gravity of an infringement and subsequently set the fine to be imposed, account may be taken, inter alia, of the geographic extent of an infringement, the mere fact that the geographic scope of one infringement is more extensive than that of another does not necessarily mean that the first infringement, considered as a whole, and in particular in the light of its nature, must be classified as more serious than the second and as therefore justifying the setting of higher multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount' than those used in the calculation of the fine for the second infringement (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 July 2014, Telefónica and Telefónica de España v Commission, C‑295/12 P, EU:C:2014:2062, paragraph 178).</p>

            <p>Nonetheless, it must be recalled that the principle of equal treatment is a general principle of EU law enshrined in Articles 20 and 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. According to settled case-law, that principle requires that comparable situations must not be treated differently and different situations must not be treated in the same way unless such treatment is objectively justified (see, inter alia, judgment of 12 November 2014, Guardian Industries and Guardian Europe v Commission, C‑580/12 P, EU:C:2014:2363, paragraph 51).</p>

            <p>Observance of that principle is binding on the General Court not only in the exercise of its review of the legality of the Commission's decision imposing fines but also in the exercise of its unlimited jurisdiction. When the amount of the fines imposed is determined, the exercise of such jurisdiction cannot result in discrimination between undertakings which have participated in an agreement or concerted practice contrary to Article 101(1) TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 18 December 2014, Commission v Parker Hannifin Manufacturing and Parker-Hannifin, C‑434/13 P, EU:C:2014:2456, paragraph 77).</p>

            <p>It follows from the case-law of the Court of Justice, however, that the taking into account, by virtue of the principle of equal treatment, of differences between the undertakings that have participated in a single cartel (in particular with regard to the geographic scope of their respective involvement) for the purpose of assessing the gravity of an infringement need not necessarily occur when the multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount' are set but may occur at another stage in the setting of the fine, such as when the basic amount of the fine is adjusted in the light of mitigating and aggravating circumstances under points 28 and 29 of the 2006 Guidelines (see, to that effect, judgments of 11 July 2013, Gosselin Group v Commission, C‑429/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:463, paragraphs 96 to 100, and of 11 July 2013, Team Relocations and Others v Commission, C‑444/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:464, paragraphs 104 and 105).</p>

            <p>As the Commission has observed, such differences may also be reflected by means of the value of sales that is used in calculating the basic amount of the fine inasmuch as that value reflects, for each participating undertaking, the scale of its involvement in the infringement in question, in accordance with point 13 of the 2006 Guidelines, under which it is possible to take as a starting point for the calculation of the fines an amount which reflects the economic significance of the infringement and the size of the undertaking's contribution to it (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 July 2013, Team Relocations and Others v Commission, C‑444/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:464, paragraph 76).</p>
