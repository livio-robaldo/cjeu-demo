In that regard, it indicated, in particular, that, given the difficulties in the interpretation of the rules governing the common organisation of the markets in respect of the exact scope and limits of the responsibility of stabilising prices assigned to the organisations in question under the derogations from competition law resulting from the application of the rules of the common agricultural policy, it had not been established that the dissemination of minimum price instructions was, in every case, necessarily and definitively prohibited, so that it had not been indisputably established that the organisations in question had exceeded the bounds of the responsibilities lawfully assigned to them as regards price stabilisation.</p>

            <p>In those proceedings, the Commission submitted observations before the Cour de Cassation (Court of Cassation) pursuant to Article 15(3) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2003 of 16 December 2002 on the implementation of the rules of competition laid down in Articles [101 and 102 TFEU] ( OJ 2003 L 1, p. 1). It explains that there are not only general derogations, adopted on the basis of Article 2 of Regulations Nos 26 and 1184/2006 and Article 176 of Regulation No 1234/2007, from the applicability of EU competition rules to the agricultural sector, but also, under Article 175 of Regulation No 1234/2007, specific derogations laid down in the various regulations on the common organisation of the markets, which impose on organisations active in the production of, and trade in, fruit and vegetables certain specific tasks which would normally be liable to be caught by the prohibitions laid down in the rules on competition. In the present case, according to the Commission, those are, for the period up to the end of 2007, Regulation No 2200/96 and, for the period from 1 January 2008, Regulation No 1182/2007, incorporated into Regulation No 1234/2007. The Commission considers, however, that the main conduct at issue in the main proceedings, namely the minimum price mechanisms agreed by the main APOs, does not form part of the specific tasks provided for by the common organisation of the market concerned and cannot be considered to be covered by those specific derogations.</p>

            <p>Indeed, in accordance with, inter alia, point (c) of the first paragraph of Article 122 and Article 125b(1)(c) of Regulation No 1234/2007, the responsibilities for production planning, concentrating supply and placing on the market, optimising production costs and stabilising producer prices, which may be assigned to a PO or an APO under the rules applicable to the common organisation of the market concerned, may relate solely to the production and marketing of the products of the members of only the PO or APO in question. Accordingly, they can justify certain forms of coordination or concertation only between producers that are members of the same PO or APO recognised by a Member State.</p>

            <p>It follows from the considerations set out in paragraphs 51 to 58 above that practices established between such POs or APOs and, a fortiori, practices involving not only such POs or APOs, but also entities not recognised by a Member State in the context of the implementation of the common agricultural policy in the sector concerned, cannot escape the prohibition of the practices referred to in Article 101(1) TFEU.</p>

            <p>To the extent that the practices at issue in the main proceedings were not adopted within the same PO or APO, but adopted between several POs, APOs and entities not recognised under the common organisation of the endive market, they could not be excluded from the scope of the prohibition of the agreements, decisions and concerted practices laid down in Article 101(1) TFEU.</p>

            <p>Concerning, next, practices agreed between producers that are members of the same PO or APO recognised by a Member State, it should be recalled that, under the common agricultural policy in the fruit and vegetables sector, recognised POs and APOs must be responsible specifically for at least one of the three objectives referred to in point (c) of the first paragraph of Article 122 of Regulation No 1234/2007 and set out in paragraph 42 above.</p>

            <p>It follows that, for EU competition rules in the fruit and vegetables sector to be inapplicable to a practice not covered by Articles 176 and 176a of Regulation No 1234/2007, the practice agreed within the PO or APO concerned must be actually and strictly connected to the pursuit of one or more of the objectives assigned to it in accordance with the rules governing the common organisation of the market concerned.</p>

            <p>As regards the objectives mentioned in paragraphs 42 and 61 above, it should be observed that the objectives of ensuring that production is planned and adjusted to demand, of concentrating supply and placing on the market the products produced by members, and of stabilising producer prices, necessarily entail the exchange of strategic information between individual producers that are members of the PO or APO concerned, the purpose of which is, inter alia, to acquire knowledge of the characteristics of the products produced by the members. Therefore, exchanges of strategic information between producers within the same PO or APO are liable to be proportionate if they are in fact made for the purposes of one or more of the objectives assigned to that PO or APO and are limited only to the information that is strictly necessary for those purposes.</p>

            <p>The objective of stabilising producer prices to ensure a fair standard of living for the agricultural community may also justify coordination between agricultural producers in the same PO or APO with regard to the quantities of agricultural products put on the market, as is clear from recital 16 of Regulation No 2200/96 and the intervention arrangements whose operating principle was laid down in Article 23 of that regulation and amended by Article 103c(2)(a) of Regulation No 1234/2007.</p>

            <p>In addition, the objective of concentrating supply to strengthen the position of producers in the face of ever greater concentration of demand may also justify a certain form of coordination of the pricing policy of individual agricultural producers within a PO or an APO. That applies in particular where the PO or APO concerned has been assigned by its members the responsibility for marketing all their products, as required, save in special cases, by Article 125a(1)(c) of Regulation No 1234/2007, read in conjunction with Article 125c thereof.</p>

            <p>By contrast, the collective fixing of minimum sale prices within a PO or an APO may not be considered, under the practices necessary in order to fulfil the responsibilities that have been assigned to them under the common organisation of the market concerned, to be proportionate to the objectives of stabilising prices and concentrating supply where it does not allow producers selling their own products themselves in the cases referred to in Article 125a(2) of Regulation No 1234/2007 to sell at a price below those minimum prices, since it has the effect of reducing the already low level of competition in the markets for agricultural products as a result, in particular, of the possibility given to producers to form POs and APOs in order to concentrate their supply.</p>
