            <p>The Commission considers that, in so far as the filling stations concerned constitute `tax warehouses' within the meaning of Article 4(11) of Directive 2008/118, petroleum products stored there are subject to a duty suspension arrangement, with the result that the collection of the excise duty is suspended. Excise duty becomes chargeable at the moment the fuel tanks of motor vehicles are filled, because the fuel departs, on Greek territory, from the duty suspension arrangement.</p>

          <num>20</num>
          <content eId="para_19519__content">
            <p>That interpretation follows from Article 7(2)(a) of Directive 2008/118 which provides that `the departure of excise goods, including irregular departure, from a duty suspension arrangement' constitutes a release for consumption. It is apparent from Article 7(1) that the term `release for consumption' denotes the time at which the excise duty becomes chargeable.</p>

            <p>In accordance with those provisions, the decisive time for a determination that excise duty is chargeable is the `release for consumption' and not the consumption itself. It follows that the chargeability is not dependant on the distance between a point of sale and the external border of a Member State. Equally, the length of time a product released for consumption remains on the territory of a Member State is of no relevance.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the argument that filling the fuel tanks of vehicles amounts to an `export transaction', once the petroleum products are subject to a `customs export arrangement' by means of a simplified export procedure is irrelevant. The departure of those products from the duty suspension arrangement within the meaning of Article 7(2) of that Directive necessarily constitutes a release for consumption.</p>

            <p>The Commission argues that Articles 17 to 31 of Directive 2008/118, governing `movement of excise goods under suspension of excise duty', bear out that interpretation. It is only once the conditions established by those articles have been met that excise goods are covered by the duty suspension arrangement.

            <p>As regards the substance, the Hellenic Republic argues that the sale of petroleum products by KAE at filling stations at the border posts of Kipoi Evrou, Kakavia and Evzonoi does not result in the excise duty becoming chargeable in cases since the fuels, at the time they are departing from the duty suspension arrangement, are immediately placed under a `customs export arrangement' through a `simplified procedure'.

            <p>In the context of a `customs suspensive arrangement', the customs authorities are responsible for monitoring tax warehouses and the departure of products from the duty suspension arrangement. They also see to it that export formalities are met, including the simplified export declaration, for the purposes of Articles 282 and 286 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code ( OJ 1993 L 253, p. 1), and they monitor the actual export of fuels outside of the customs territory of the Union, pursuant to Article 161 of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 establishing the Community Customs Code ( OJ 1992 L 302, p. 1). Therefore, the sale of those products, their departure from the duty suspension regime and their export form part of a single procedure.</p>

            <p>The Hellenic Republic submits that Directive 2008/118 does not preclude a Member State from establishing such a `simplified export procedure' for the following reasons.</p>

            <p>Secondly, due to the fact that the `export arrangement' immediately follows the duty suspension arrangement, Article 7(2)(a) of Directive 2008/118 does not apply here. That provision covers only the outright departure of excise goods from a duty suspension arrangement.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, Article 7 of Directive 2008/118 does not entail full harmonisation, with the result that release for consumption is not the only possible outcome to the departure of a product from a duty suspension arrangement. Article 17(1)(a)(iii) of Directive 2008/118 acknowledges the possibility for Member States to place products previously in a duty suspension arrangement into an export arrangement without excise duty becoming chargeable. Thus the `simplified export procedure' at issue does not affect the harmonisation measures provided for in that directive. Moreover, unlike Regulation No 2913/92 the gaps in that directive mean that Member States have considerable latitude.</p>

            <p>Fourthly and finally, Article 17(1)(a)(iii) and Article 25 of Directive 2008/118 do not apply, since the petroleum products concerned in the present case leave the customs territory of the Union directly, and are not moved under a duty suspension arrangement. In accordance with Article 269(1) of Regulation (EU) No 952/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 October 2013 laying down the Union Customs Code ( OJ 2013 L 269, p. 1), the supply of petroleum products is to take place under the export procedure provided for in that article. It is clear from that provision that `Union goods to be taken out of the customs territory of the Union shall be placed under the export procedure'. Therefore, there would be no justification for levying excise duty.</p>

          <content eId="para_19533__content">
            <p>Moreover, the simplified export procedure ensures that the petroleum products are not consumed on Greek territory but rather exported to a third country. For reasons of common sense, the fact that the vehicles must travel a short distance between filling stations and the actual borders should not call that conclusion into question.</p>

            <p>That distance would be easily accounted for by the remaining fuel in the fuel tanks of the vehicles before re-fuelling and it would thus be disproportionate to charge excise duty. In addition, as is apparent from paragraphs 25 to 33 of the judgment of 14 November 1985, Neumann ( 299/84, EU:C:1985:463), in the present case the application of the rules of Directive 2008/118 would be disproportionate by virtue of their general nature and if the Union legislator had legislated for this specific case, it would have done so on the basis of fairness.</p>

It is a feature of that arrangement that the excise duty on the products covered by it is not yet payable, although the chargeable event for taxation purposes has already taken place. Consequently, as regards the excise goods, that arrangement postpones the chargeability of excise duty until one of the conditions of chargeability is met (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 January 2016, BP Europa, C‑64/15, EU:C:2016:62, paragraph 22).</p>
