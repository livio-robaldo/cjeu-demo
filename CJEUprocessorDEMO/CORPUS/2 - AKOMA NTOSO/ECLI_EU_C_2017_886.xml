            <p>On 27 September 2010, the Commission issued a press release on its webpage in which it stated that, given the large number of health claims and the delays in processing them, it was in favour of establishing a process allowing for gradual adoption of the list of claims permitted in the European Union. Furthermore, according to the Commission, that change of priorities in the procedure for the adoption of that list was explained inter alia by tensions reported about the treatment of plant ingredients under the legislation on health claims and under legislation governing traditional herbal medicinal products, and by the need to continue the reflection on the consistent treatment of those ingredients. Consequently, the Commission requested the EFSA to suspend temporarily its assessment of the health claims relating to botanical substances and to concentrate instead on all the other claims submitted with a view to completing the examination of those claims as soon as possible. In that context, the Commission explained that the health claims concerning substances other than botanical substances would be examined in a first stage, whereas claims relating to botanical substances would be examined in a second stage.</p>

            <p>On 16 May 2012 the Commission adopted Regulation No 432/2012. In that regulation the Commission authorised a partial list of 222 health claims, corresponding to 497 entries in the consolidated list, for which the EFSA had essentially concluded that the information submitted was sufficient to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between a food category, a food or one of its constituents and the claimed effect.</p>

            <p>On the same date, the Commission identified a list of more than 2000 claims in respect of which the EFSA had not completed its evaluation or the Commission itself had not yet taken a decision, and published that list on its website. According to the Commission, those health claims, which principally concerned the effects of botanical substances, remained on hold and therefore could continue to be used in accordance with the transitional scheme provided for in Article 28(5) and (6) of Regulation No 1924/2006. Whereas the partial list of permitted claims established by Regulation No 432/2012 was subsequently updated by the Commission, the health claims relating to botanical substances remained on hold.</p>

            <p>By letters of 19 June 2014 ( `the letters of 19 June 2014'), the Commission replied to those requests to act from Bionorica and Diapharm, by stating inter alia as follows: `As you are aware, the Commission initiated a reflection on health claims on so-called ``botanicals '' after concerns were raised by a number of Member States and stakeholders with regard to the differentiated treatment of products containing such substances under the legislation on health claims and that on the traditional herbal medicinal products. Pending the outcome of this reflection, the Commission has asked the [EFSA] to discontinue its scientific assessment of health claims on botanicals. The Commission recognises the importance of this complex issue both for consumers and business operators. However, to identify the best course of action needed, the Commission should be allowed the time and context necessary for that purpose.'</p>

          <num>35</num>
          <content eId="para_4207__content">
            <p>First, the General Court held, in paragraphs 38, 42 and 43 of the order in Case T‑619/14 and paragraphs 38, 41 and 42 of the order in Case T‑620/14, that it was clear from the wording of Article 28(5) and (6) of Regulation No 1924/2006 that the application of transitional measures is provided for, since the adoption of that regulation, in respect of health claims that are under evaluation and those in respect of which no decision has been adopted by the Commission. In those circumstances, companies affected by the health claims on hold may continue to make those claims, provided that they comply with the transitional rules laid down in Article 28(5) and (6) of that regulation. Consequently, according to the General Court, Article 17(5) of Regulation No 1924/2006, which allows, in principle, any food business operator to make permitted health claims included in the definitive list, places those health claims in the same situation as health claims on hold, that is to say, in a situation in which they may be used for the marketing of food.</p>

        <paragraph eId="para_4208">
          <num>36</num>
          <content eId="para_4208__content">
            <p>Moreover, the General Court held, in paragraphs 44 and 45 of the order in Case T‑619/14 and paragraphs 43 and 44 of the order in Case T‑620/14, that, in any event, even if it could be established that there were consequences for the legal situation of Bionorica and other food business operators under Article 17(5) of Regulation No 1924/2006 by comparison, inter alia, with its situation under the transitional provisions provided for in Article 28(5) and (6) of the regulation, such a benefit rested, by definition, on the premiss that its health claims on hold would be authorised on conclusion of the EFSA's assessment and in the Commission's final decision. However, the General Court observed that that premiss remained, for the time being, a premiss and, for that reason, could not satisfy the requirements of the case-law, which established that, if the interest pleaded by an applicant concerns a future legal situation, it must demonstrate that the prejudice to that situation is already certain. In that regard, the General Court recalled that, by Regulation No 432/2012, which established a partial list of permitted health claims, the Commission had authorised only 222 health claims out of a total of more than 2000 claims examined, such that the transitional regime could prove to be more advantageous for the operators than the definitive list of permitted health claims.</p>

          <content eId="para_4209__content">
            <p>Secondly, the General Court rejected, in paragraphs 47 and 48 of the order in Case T‑619/14 and paragraphs 46 and 47 of the order in Case T‑620/14, the arguments advanced by Bionorica and Diapharm that the fact that certain health claims had been the object of an assessment by the EFSA and that other claims remained on hold created unequal terms of competition in the market, holding that such an unequal situation could only affect the interests of producers whose health claims were rejected following the adoption of Regulation No 432/2012 and not those of producers whose health claims remained on hold.</p>

          <content eId="para_4210__content">
            <p>Thirdly, the General Court did not accept the assertions made by Bionorica and Diapharma that they were strongly affected by the legal uncertainty governing the market owing to the lack of a definitive and complete decision by the Commission on the authorisation of health claims. In that regard, the General Court noted, in paragraphs 51 and 52 of the order in Case T‑619/14 and paragraphs 50 and 51 of the order in Case T‑620/14, that the principle of legal certainty required that legal rules be clear and precise, and that their consequences be foreseeable. According to the General Court, both the rules applicable to, on the one hand, authorised or rejected health claims and, on the other hand, health claims on hold, satisfy those requirements. In particular, the rules to which the health claims on hold were subject flowed expressly from Regulation No 1924/2006 and, in particular, Article 28(5) and (6) thereof, which set out the rules applicable, since the adoption of that regulation, to health claims pending an assessment and a final decision.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, in paragraph 54 of the order in Case T‑619/14 and paragraph 53 of the order in Case T‑620/14, the General Court rejected the claims made by Bionorica and Diapharm that they had suffered financial loss as a result of the Commission's lack of action, observing that they had not explained either how those losses arose or how they would disappear if the Commission were to instruct the EFSA to proceed with the assessment of the health claims on hold.</p>

          <content eId="para_4212__content">
            <p>Finally, in the third place, the General Court examined and upheld, in Case T‑620/14 only, the plea of inadmissibility, relied on by the Commission, alleging that Bionorica and Diapharm lacked locus standi. The General Court found in that regard, in paragraph 56 of the order in Case T‑620/14, that Diapharm -- which is a company supplying advisory and support services (including in respect of health claims on food) to companies in the health industry -- does not manufacture or market those types of products on the European Union market. For that reason, according to the General Court, Diapharm is not sufficiently linked to the latter activities for it to be regarded as being directly concerned by the act to be adopted by the Commission following a possible finding of failure to act on its part.</p>

            <p>In that regard, Bionorica and Diapharm submit that, in the first two sentences of those letters, the Commission merely set out the status quo as it existed with respect to the assessment of the health claims of botantical substances. The appellants themselves had already summarised that situation in their letters requesting the Commission to act. Furthermore, they submit that the process of reflection to which the Commission referred in the letters of 19 June 2014, in the context of which a consultation document on the further assessment of those claims was sent to the Member States, was commenced by that institution in July 2012 and completed at the end of 2012 with the majority of the Member States deciding in favour of the continuation of the assessment in accordance with the scientific approach applied until then, including of the health claims on hold. According to Bionorica and Diapharm, the letters of 19 June 2014 are at the very least ambiguous to the extent that they could refer to a fresh process of reflection.</p>

In the fourth and final sentence, the Commission simply explained that it required time and context in order to determine the `best course of action required' without however explaining what it regarded as necessary in the present case.</p>

In accordance with the judgment of the Court of 22 May 1985, Parliament v Council ( 13/83, EU:C:1985:220, paragraph 25), such an evasive reply is not capable of constituting a defined position sufficient to bring an end to the failure to act.</p>

Finally, it was clear from the letters of 19 June 2014 and their context that the Commission considered, at the time when it sent those letters to Bionorica and Diapharm, that the circumstances did not justify upholding their requests to act.</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is common ground that, under Article 13(3) of Regulation No 1924/2006, the Commission was required to consult the EFSA with a view to adopting thereafter a definitive list of permitted health claims within the time limit prescribed, namely by 31 January 2010 at the latest, and that that list had only partially been adopted by Regulation No 432/2012, on 16 May 2012. Moreover, it is not contested that Bionorica and Diapharm, by their letters of 22 and 24 April 2014 respectively (referred to in paragraph 24 above) duly requested the Commission to act, namely to ask the EFSA to resume immediately the assessment of the health claims relating to botanical substances with a view to the adoption of a definitive list of permitted claims and, in reply to those letters, the Commission restricted itself to concluding, in the letters of 19 June 2014 (referred to in paragraph 25 above) that `to identify the best course of action needed, [it] should be allowed the time and context necessary for that purpose.'</p>

            <p>By its first ground of appeal, Bionorica complains that the General Court committed a procedural error in that it partly based its decision on incorrect facts and that it therefore wrongly classified it, in paragraphs 1 and 48 of the order in Case T‑619/14, as a company that manufactured and marketed food supplements or food on the European market. As a consequence, according to Bionorica, the General Court reached an erroneous decision against it in deciding that it was not concerned by the health claims on hold and that the existence of unequal terms of competition could not therefore be the basis of its interest in bringing proceedings in the present case.</p>

            <p>Bionorica and Diapharm submit, in the first place, that the use of permitted health claims and the use of health claims on hold are subject to different requirements and, therefore, cannot be placed in the same situation. They state, in that regard, that paragraphs 5 and 6 of Article 28 of Regulation No 1924/2006 do not allow the unconditional use of health claims on hold, but subject their use to conditions, including, in particular, that those claims `comply with this regulation and with existing national provisions applicable to them'.</p>

            <p>That implies, in particular, that, in accordance with Regulation No 1924/2006, the health claims on hold must not be misleading and must be based on generally accepted scientific data. In that regard, the question of whether the conditions are complied with or whether purchasers are wrongly induced would be subject, in addition to the review carried out by the national authorities responsible for the supervision of food, to an examination on a case by case basis by the national courts before which other market operators may bring actions. In German practice such court supervision, which can lead to an immediate suspension of sales on German territory, would involve a summary examination that does not systematically give rise to outcomes that are materially justifiable and which, moreover, may differ radically from one court to another in respect of the same health claim, above all given the imprecise legal criterion of generally accepted scientific evidence which leaves scope for widely diverging interpretations.</p>

            <p>Consequently, there is never any legal certainty whatsoever at any time, either for Bionorica and Diapharm or for the other companies, as to whether the health claims on hold may lawfully be used. By contrast, it would be different if permitted health claims were included in a positive and exhaustive list which would bring an end to case by case assessments. In addition, Bionorica and Diapharm submit in that regard that the EU legislature has not expressly laid down transitional measures for the period after 31 January 2010, namely after the deadline set in Article 13(3) of Regulation No 1924/2006 for the adoption of the list of permitted health claims.</p>

Whereas it would be clear, in the case of those health claims that are authorised and those that are rejected, that they may or may not be used, the same legal certainty does not exist for the health claims on hold.</p>

The transitional measures that apply to the health claims on hold, which, first, mean that for each case a new assessment in which there is, as regards the assessment of scientific evidence, a wide margin of discretion, and which, second, can lead to widely diverging -- even contradictory -- outcomes, in particular in German judicial practice, would not produce sufficiently foreseeable legal consequences.</p>

            <p>First of all, to the argument advanced by Bionorica and Diapharm that the General Court had wrongly placed permitted health claims and those that remained on hold in the same situation, the Commission counters that the General Court merely observed, in paragraphs 43 and 42 of the orders in Case T‑619/14 and Case T‑620/14 respectively, that the use of health claims was permitted in both cases. According to the Commission, that finding is correct in law in the light of the provisions of Article 28(5) and (6) of Regulation No 1924/2006. By contrast, it goes without saying, according to the Commission, that the use of lawful health claims, whether they are authorised or on hold, presupposes that the conditions laid down for that purpose by the European Union are satisfied in each case. In addition, the appellants' observations as regards the alleged negative effects of the application of national law in force should be directed, regarding their substance, not against the General Court but, first, against the German legislature and the German courts and, second, against the EU legislature that adopted the transitional provisions concerned.</p>

            <p>Next, in response to the argument that the General Court wrongly found that they could only draw a future and uncertain benefit from the authorisation of the health claims on hold, the Commission observes that the appellants do not dispute, in that context, that the General Court correctly held that the authorisation of health claims concerning botanical substances was not yet a confirmed fact and could not therefore satisfy the criteria, established by settled case-law, according to which it is for the appellant, if the interest that it claims to have concerns a future legal situation, to demonstrate that the prejudice to that situation is already certain.</p>

            <p>However, Bionorica and Diapharm consider that even a refusal to authorise the health claims relating to botanical substances could confer an advantage on them. According to the Commission, that argument, which could never in any case emanate from a company in the food sector wishing to use a health claim, shows that the appellants attach importance not to the authorisation of health claims relating to botanical substances but only to the existence of any list whatsoever, which could certainly have effects for the legal situation of other businesses but which, with regard to the appellants' commercial activities, can only concern their factual situation.</p>

            <p>In Bionorica's case, such a refusal would mean that food businesses would no longer have the right to use those claims, which would allow Bionorica, as a manufacturer of herbal medicinal products, to keep unwanted competitors in the food sector at a distance. As to Diapharm, the rejection or authorisation or even the continued suspension of the health claims relating to botanical substances would also have no effect on its legal situation, given that that company could carry on its advisory activities in all those situations.</p>

            <p>Finally, the Commission submits that the appellants' arguments alleging legal uncertainty arising from the application of transitional measures must be rejected on the ground that the validity of the General Court's findings in respect of legal certainty, which are challenged by the appellants, is fully confirmed by the case-law on that subject.</p>

            <p>In the present case, in the first place, in paragraphs 38 to 43 and 45 of the order in Case T‑619/14 and in paragraphs 38 to 42 and 44 of the order in Case T‑620/14, the General Court upheld the Commission's argument that Bionorica and Diapharm could not procure any certain benefit from the adoption of a definitive list of permitted health claims because, in essence, the applicable transitional regime already placed the health claims on hold in a situation that was just as beneficial as that of permitted health claims.</p>

            <p>However, such a finding of equivalence of the transitional and definitive regimes cannot be confirmed. In that regard, while it is true, as the General Court held in paragraph 43 of the order in Case T‑619/14 and in paragraph 42 of the order in Case T‑620/14, that the permitted health claims and the health claims on hold could, in principle, be used in the marketing of food, it remains the case that the two categories of claims are subject to different requirements and do not benefit from the same conditions.</p>

            <p>Whereas Article 17(5) of Regulation No 1924/2006 authorises, in principle, any food business operator to use the permitted health claims, included in the single definitive list for the European Union, the health claims on hold which are subject to the transitional regime must, inter alia, pursuant to Article 28(5) and (6) of that regulation, comply with that regulation and also the applicable national provisions.</p>

            <p>That means, in particular, first, that in accordance with the second paragraph of Article 3, point (a), and Article 6(1) of Regulation No 1924/2006, all health claims must not be false, ambiguous or misleading and must be based on generally accepted scientific evidence. Second, the health claims on hold must also meet, in each Member State, the requirements of its own national regime. Consequently, their examination on a case by case basis entails a risk of giving rise to diverging outcomes at the end of national administrative and judicial proceedings for the authorisation of such claims, not only as between one Member State and another, but also within the same Member State.</p>

            <p>As regards the finding made by the General Court, in paragraph 45 of the order in Case T‑619/14 and in paragraph 44 of the order in Case T‑620/14, that weighing against recognising Bionorica and Diapharm as having an interest in bringing proceedings was the fact that the transitional regime could be more advantageous than the definitive rejection of a health claim having regard to the fact that, by Regulation No 432/2012, which established a partial list of permitted health claims, the Commission had authorised only 222 claims out of a total of more than 2000 claims assessed, it must be observed that that finding is vitiated by errors.</p>
