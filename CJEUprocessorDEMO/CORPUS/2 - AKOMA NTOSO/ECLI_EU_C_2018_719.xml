            <p>Annex XII to the 2003 Act of Accession is entitled `List referred to in Article 24 of the Act of Accession: Poland'. Chapter 2, paragraphs 1, 2, 5 and 9 of that Annex, concerning the free movement of persons, is worded as follows: `1.   Article [45] and the first paragraph of Article [56] [TFEU] shall fully apply only, in relation to the freedom of movement of workers and the freedom to provide services involving temporary movement of workers as defined in Article 1 of Directive 96/71/EC [of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 1996 concerning the posting of workers in the framework of the provision of services ( OJ 1997 L 18, p. 1)] between Poland on the one hand, and Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, Estonia, Greece, Spain, France, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Hungary, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia, Slovakia, Finland, Sweden and the United Kingdom on the other hand, subject to the transitional provisions laid down in paragraphs 2 to 14. 2.   By way of derogation from Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 [of the Council of 15 October 1968 on freedom of movement for workers within the Community (OJ English Special Edition 1968 (II), p. 475)] and until the end of the two-year period following the date of accession, the present Member States will apply national measures, or those resulting from bilateral agreements, regulating access to their labour markets by Polish nationals. The present Member States may continue to apply such measures until the end of the five year period following the date of the accession. Polish nationals legally working in a present Member State at the date of accession and admitted to the labour market of that Member State for an uninterrupted period of 12 months or longer will enjoy access to the labour market of that Member State but not to the labour market of other Member States applying national measures. Polish nationals admitted to the labour market of a present Member State following accession for an uninterrupted period of 12 months or longer shall also enjoy the same rights. The Polish nationals mentioned in the second and third subparagraphs above shall cease to enjoy the rights contained in those subparagraphs if they voluntarily leave the labour market of the present Member State in question. Polish nationals legally working in a present Member State at the date of accession, or during a period when national measures are applied, and who were admitted to the labour market of that Member State for a period of less than 12 months shall not enjoy these rights.... 5.   A Member State maintaining national measures or measures resulting from bilateral agreements at the end of the five-year period indicated in paragraph 2 may, in case of serious disturbances of its labour market or threat thereof and after notifying the Commission, continue to apply these measures until the end of the seven-year period following the date of accession. In the absence of such notification, Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation [No 1612/68] shall apply. ... 9.   In so far as certain provisions of Directive 68/360/EEC [Council Directive of 15 October 1968 on the abolition of restrictions on movement and residence within the Community for workers of Member States and their families (OJ, English Special Edition 1968 (II), p. 485)] may not be dissociated from those of Regulation [No 1612/68] whose application is deferred pursuant to paragraphs 2 to 5 and 7 and 8, Poland and the present Member States may derogate from those provisions to the extent necessary for the application of paragraphs 2 to 5 and 7 and 8.'</p>

                <p>31 By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Chapter 2 of Annex XII to the 2003 Act of Accession must be interpreted as permitting, during the transitional period provided for by that act, the United Kingdom to exclude a Polish national from the benefits of Article 7(3) of Directive 2004/38 and Article 7(2) of Regulation No 492/2011 when that person does not satisfy the requirement imposed by national law of having completed an uninterrupted 12-month period of registered work in the United Kingdom.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be noted, as a preliminary point, that paragraph 1 of Chapter 2 of Annex XII to the 2003 Act of Accession provides that Article 39 and the first paragraph of Article 49 of the EC Treaty (now Article 45 and the first paragraph of Article 56 TFEU, respectively) fully apply only subject to the transitional provisions laid down in paragraphs 2 to 14 of that chapter, in relation to the freedom of movement of workers and the freedom to provide services involving temporary movement of workers between Poland and the `present' Member States. Those transitional provisions lay down, in essence, derogations from Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation No 1612/68 and, under certain conditions, from Directive 68/360.</p>

            <p>Admittedly, Chapter 2 of Annex XII to the 2003 Act of Accession refers neither to Directive 2004/38 nor to Regulation No 492/2011, those instruments having been adopted after that act came into force. Nevertheless, it is clear from the very wording of Article 38(3) of that directive and Article 41 of that regulation that the references made to Regulation No 1612/68 and Directive 68/360, repealed by those two acts, must be regarded as being made to the corresponding articles of Directive 2004/38 and Regulation No 492/2011, respectively.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, in order to answer the question asked by the referring court, it must be ascertained whether Chapter 2 of Annex XII to the 2003 Act of Accession permitted the United Kingdom, in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, not to apply Article 7(3) of Directive 2004/38. The application of Article 7(2) of Regulation No 492/2011, according to which the worker who is a national of a Member State is to enjoy, in the territory of another Member State, the same social and tax advantages as national workers, is based on the premiss that a person in Mr Prefeta's situation who is no longer a worker must nevertheless be able to retain his status as a worker pursuant to Article 7(3) of Directive 2004/38.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it is important to point out, as observed by the Advocate General in point 62 of his Opinion, that the possibility for an EU citizen who has temporarily ceased to pursue an activity as an employed or self-employed person of retaining his status of worker on the basis of Article 7(3) of Directive 2004/38, as well as the corresponding right of residence under Article 7(1) of the directive, is based on the assumption that the citizen is available and able to re-enter the labour market of the host Member State within a reasonable period (see, by analogy, judgment of 19 June 2014, Saint Prix, C‑507/12, EU:C:2014:2007, paragraphs 38 to 41).</p>

Moreover, Article 7(3)(b) and (c) of that directive requires economically inactive EU citizens to register as jobseekers with the relevant employment office and Article 7(3)(d) of the directive requires such persons, under specific conditions, to embark on vocational training.</p>

            <p>The first sentence of paragraph 2 of Chapter 2 of Annex XII to that act of accession provides, in essence, that, by way of derogation from Articles 1 to 6 of Regulation No 492/2011 and during the transitional period following the date of accession, the `present' Member States are to apply measures regulating access to their labour markets by Polish nationals.</p>

Those regulations provided that the workers in question would no longer have that status once they had worked without interruption for a period of 12 months falling partly or wholly after 30 April 2004 as a registered worker on the territory of that Member State.</p>

            <p>As regards the second condition, it must be noted that the 2004 Regulations made admission to the labour market subject to obtaining a registration certificate from the competent national authorities.</p>

            <p>However, it is apparent from the case file before the Court that Mr Prefeta obtained a certificate registering his employment from the competent United Kingdom authorities only on 5 January 2011, so that he must be regarded as having been admitted to the labour market of that Member State for a total period of just two months and six days, which is less than the 12 months required under the third subparagraph of paragraph 2 of Chapter 2 of Annex XII to the 2003 Act of Accession.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, as Mr Prefeta could not rely on Article 7(3) of Directive 2004/38 in order to retain his status as a worker after his employment ceased, he was not in a position to rely on Article 7(2) of Regulation No 492/2011 either, as the latter provision covers Member State nationals who have that status (see, to that effect, judgments of 18 July 2007, Geven, C‑213/05, EU:C:2007:438, paragraph 16, and of 21 February 2013, N., C‑46/12, EU:C:2013:97, paragraphs 48 and 49).</p>

            <p>Consequently, there is no need to ascertain whether Chapter 2 of Annex XII to the 2003 Act of Accession permitted the United Kingdom not to apply Article 7(2) of Directive 492/2011 in circumstances such as those of the case in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question is that Chapter 2 of Annex XII to the 2003 Act of Accession must be interpreted as permitting, during the transitional period provided for by that act, the United Kingdom to exclude a Polish national, such as Mr Prefeta, from the benefits of Article 7(3) of Directive 2004/38 when that person does not satisfy the requirement imposed by national law of having completed an uninterrupted 12‑month period of registered work in the United Kingdom.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fifth Chamber) hereby rules: Chapter 2 of Annex XII to the Act concerning the conditions of accession of the Czech Republic, the Republic of Estonia, the Republic of Cyprus, the Republic of Latvia, the Republic of Lithuania, the Republic of Hungary, the Republic of Malta, the Republic of Poland, the Republic of Slovenia and the Slovak Republic and the adjustments to the Treaties on which the European Union is founded, must be interpreted as permitting, during the transitional period provided for by that act, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland to exclude a Polish national, such as Mr Rafal Prefeta, from the benefits of Article 7(3) of Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States amending Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 and repealing Directives 64/221/EEC, 68/360/EEC, 72/194/EEC, 73/148/EEC, 75/34/EEC, 75/35/EEC, 90/364/EEC, 90/365/EEC and 93/96/EEC, when that person has not satisfied the requirement imposed by national law of having completed an uninterrupted 12-month period of registered work in the United Kingdom.</p>
