                <p>The introduction of the proceeds of illegal activities into the financial system and their investment after laundering are detrimental to sound and sustainable economic development. Accordingly, Council Directive 91/308/EEC of 10 June 1991 on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering [ OJ 1991 L 166, p. 77] introduced a Community mechanism to prevent money laundering by monitoring transactions through credit and financial institutions and certain types of professions. As there is a risk that the application of that mechanism will lead to an increase in cash movements for illicit purposes, Directive 91/308 ... should be supplemented by a control system on cash entering or leaving the Community. ...</p>

                    <p>Account should also be taken of complementary activities carried out in other international fora, in particular those of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering (FATF), which was established by the G7 Summit held in Paris in 1989. Special Recommendation IX of 22 October 2004 of the FATF calls on governments to take measures to detect physical cash movements, including a declaration system or other disclosure obligation.</p>

                    <p>Accordingly, cash carried by any natural person entering or leaving the Community should be subject to the principle of obligatory declaration. This principle would enable the customs authorities to gather information on such cash movements and, where appropriate, transmit that information to other authorities. ...</p>

                    <p>In view of its preventive purpose and deterrent character, the obligation to declare should be fulfilled upon entering or leaving the Community. However, in order to focus the authorities' action on significant movements of cash, only those movements of EUR 10000 or more should be subject to such an obligation. Also, it should be specified that the obligation to declare applies to the natural person carrying the cash, regardless of whether that person is the owner.'</p>

            <p>Moreover, as is apparent from Article 1(1) of Regulation No 1889/2005, read in conjunction with recitals 1 to 3 of that regulation, in the context of promoting harmonious, balanced and sustainable economic development throughout the European Union, that regulation seeks to supplement the provisions of Directive 91/308 by laying down harmonised rules for the control of cash entering or leaving the European Union (see judgment of 16 July 2015, Chmielewski, C‑255/14, EU:C:2015:475, paragraph 17).</p>

            <p>In that context, it should also be recalled that the Court has held that Directive 2005/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 October 2005 on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing ( OJ 2005 L 309, p. 15), which replaced Directive 91/308, has as its main aim the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purposes of money laundering and terrorist financing, as is apparent both from its title and the preamble, and from the fact that it was adopted, like its predecessor, Directive 91/308, in an international context, in order to apply and make binding in the European Union the recommendations of the `Financial Action Task Force' (FATF), which is the main international body combating money laundering (see, judgment of 25 April 2013, Jyske Bank Gibraltar, C‑212/11, EU:C:2013:270, point 46).</p>

            <p>Like Directives 91/308 and 2005/60, Regulation 1889/2005, as is apparent from its fourth recital, was adopted in order to take account of complementary activities carried out in other international fora, in particular those of FATF, whose Special Recommendation IX of 22 October 2004 calls on governments to take measures to detect physical cash movements, including a declaration system or other disclosure obligation.</p>

            <p>Consequently, as the Advocate General stated in points 44 and 45 of his Opinion, it is clear from the objective pursued by Regulation No 1889/2005, from its international context and from the need to pursue the preventive and deterrent aim of the obligation to declare laid down in Article 3(1) of that regulation, that the notion of a `natural person entering or leaving' the European Union, referred to in that provision, must be given a broad interpretation.</p>
