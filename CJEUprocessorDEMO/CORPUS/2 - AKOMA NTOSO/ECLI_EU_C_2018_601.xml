            <p>The appellant in the main proceedings was born in 1992 and resides in the municipality of Espoo in Finland. According to the findings made by the referring court, he has a substantial need for help, including in the performance of his everyday activities. The municipality of Espoo therefore provided him with a personal carer to enable him to follow secondary school studies in Finland.</p>

            <p>In August 2013, A applied to the municipality of Espoo, under the Disability Services Law, for personal assistance amounting to about five hours per week to cover the costs of household chores, such as shopping, housework and laundry. At the time of that application, A was in the process of moving to Tallinn in Estonia to attend a three-year, full-time law course there: as a result of that move, he would be spending three or four days a week in Tallinn but intended to return to Espoo at weekends. The services that he applied for would therefore have had to be provided outside Finland.</p>

            <p>By decision of 12 November 2013, confirmed by decision of 4 February 2014 following an internal appeal, A's application for personal assistance was rejected on the ground that his stay outside Finland had to be regarded as other than occasional residence, even though his home municipality had not changed. The municipality of Espoo took the view that it was under no obligation to provide services and support outside Finland, since that type of stay approximated to the concept of `habitual residence'. It was also held that personal assistance can be arranged outside Finland for periods of holiday or business travel, while costs are not reimbursed if a person's home municipality changes because of a stay outside Finland, or in the case of other long-term or permanent residence abroad.</p>

However, the discretion afforded, in particular by Paragraph 8d of the law, so far as the powers of the home municipality of the beneficiary are concerned, does not relate to eligibility for the personal assistance but to the arrangements for allocating that assistance and the extent thereof, as personal assistance has to be provided by the municipality when the claimant is a severely disabled person who is resident in the municipality, regardless of that person's income.

            <p>In view of the foregoing, the answer to the first question is that Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation No 883/2004 must be interpreted as meaning that a benefit such as the personal assistance at issue in the main proceedings, which entails, inter alia, covering the costs to which a severely disabled person's everyday activities give rise, with the aim of enabling that person, who is not economically active, to study in higher education, does not fall within the concept of `sickness benefit' within the meaning of that provision and is therefore outside the scope of Regulation No 883/2004.</p>

            <p>53 By its second and third questions, which are raised in the event of the personal assistance at issue in the main proceedings not being encompassed by the concept of `sickness benefits' and therefore falling outside the scope of Regulation No 883/2004, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Articles 20 and 21 TFEU preclude the home municipality of a resident of a Member State who is severely disabled from refusing to grant that person a benefit such as the personal assistance at issue in the main proceedings on the ground that he is staying in another Member State in order to pursue his higher education studies there.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, it should be noted that the referring court has explained, first, that it is common ground that the habitual residence of the appellant in the main proceedings continues to be in Finland, in accordance with the relevant national legislation, and that the period he is required to spend in Estonia each week for the purposes of his studies is only temporary inasmuch as the intention is that he should return to his home municipality every weekend. Secondly, the referring court has explained that the pursuit of studies, unlike business travel and holidays, has not been accepted as being among the grounds permitting the person concerned to receive the personal assistance at issue in the main proceedings outside Finland.</p>

            <p>Having clarified that point, the Court observes that, as a Finnish national, A enjoys the status of citizen of the Union under Article 20(1) TFEU and may therefore rely on the rights conferred on those having that status, including against his Member State of origin (see, inter alia, judgment of 26 February 2015, Martens, C‑359/13, EU:C:2015:118, paragraph 20 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Such a restriction can be justified in the light of EU law only if it is based on objective considerations of public interest independent of the nationality of the persons concerned and if it is proportionate to the legitimate objective of the provisions of national law. It follows from the Court's case-law that a measure is proportionate when, while appropriate for securing the attainment of the objective pursued, it does not go beyond what is necessary in order to achieve it (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 26 February 2015, Martens, C‑359/13, EU:C:2015:118, paragraph 34 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>So far as justification for the national measure is concerned, the Finnish Government submits that no overriding ground of public interest is capable of justifying the restriction at issue in the main proceedings. The Swedish Government, on the other hand, contends that the municipality's obligations to supervise the arrangements for the personal assistance at issue in the main proceedings and, in that context, the maintenance of the financial balance of the social security system justify that assistance being granted only in Finnish territory. Moreover, the referring court, alluding to paragraphs 89 and 90 of the judgment of 21 July 2011, Stewart ( C‑503/09, EU:C:2011:500), mentions in its order for reference, as a public-interest objective capable of justifying such a restriction, the maintenance of the coherence and efficacy of the system of personal assistance provided for by the Disability Services Law and the securing of a genuine link between the person claiming assistance and the Member State that is competent to grant it.</p>

            <p>It is true that objectives of national legislation which seek to establish a genuine link between a claimant to short-term incapacity benefit in youth and the competent Member State and to preserve the financial balance of the national social security system, constitute, in principle, legitimate objectives capable of justifying restrictions on the rights of freedom of movement and residence under Article 21 TFEU (judgment of 21 July 2011, Stewart, C‑503/09, EU:C:2011:500, paragraph 90).</p>

            <p>However, the Court concluded that the conditions requiring the presence of the person claiming the incapacity benefit could not be justified by the objectives mentioned in the preceding paragraph of this judgment. In particular, the Court held that, although the person claiming that benefit lived in a Member State other than the Member State concerned, the fact that there was a genuine and sufficient connection with the latter Member State could be established on the basis of factors other than the claimant's presence in that Member State prior to her claim, such as the relationship between the claimant and the social security system of that Member State as well as the claimant's family circumstances (judgment of 21 July 2011, Stewart, C‑503/09, EU:C:2011:500, paragraphs 97 to 102, 104 and 109).</p>

            <p>The Court also held that that assessment applied with regard to the objective of ensuring the financial balance of the national social security system, since the need to establish a genuine and sufficient connection between the person claiming the benefit in question and the competent Member State enables the latter to satisfy itself that the economic cost of paying that benefit does not become unreasonable (judgment of 21 July 2011, Stewart, C‑503/09, EU:C:2011:500, paragraph 103).</p>

            <p>A conclusion to that effect can be applied to A's situation in the case before the referring court.

            <p>In that context, the Court, echoing the question raised by the Advocate General in his Opinion, draws attention to the fact (alluded to by the referring court) that the personal assistance at issue in the main proceedings can continue to be awarded when the person concerned is in higher education in a Finnish municipality that may be a long way from his home municipality. The home municipality's ability to monitor the use of the personal assistance in that situation is not much more limited than it is in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, in which A pursues his studies outside Finland but in a neighbouring region, returning every weekend to his Finnish home municipality.</p>
