            <p>According to the referring court, in so far as the applicant in the main proceedings had his habitual residence in Germany during the change of name process in Romania, Paragraph 48 of the EGBGB is not applicable, since that provision makes the right to choose, by declaration to the registry office, a name acquired in another EU Member State subject to the condition that the name in question must have been acquired during a period of habitual residence in that other Member State, which is not satisfied in this case.</p>

            <p>The referring court states that an application by analogy of Paragraph 48 of the EGBGB is also not possible.

            <p>The referring court therefore asks whether Articles 18 and 21 TFEU contain an obligation to recognise a change of name which has taken place in another Member State where, although the person concerned was not habitually resident in that other Member State, he has another connection with that Member State by virtue of his dual nationality.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, it must be observed that the referring court relies on Paragraph 48 of the EGBGB when, by its question, it seeks to ascertain whether Articles 18 and 21 TFEU preclude the competent authorities of a Member State from refusing to recognise the surname legally acquired, by a national of that Member State, in another Member State of which he is also a national, even though he did not have his habitual residence in that other Member State.</p>

            <p>It must be noted that, in its request, the referring court mentions the existence, also highlighted by the German Government and the European Commission, of a separate public law procedure, laid down by the Law on changes of name, by which a person may apply to the administrative authority for a change of name.</p>

            <p>That procedure laid down by the Law on changes of name is, according to the German Government, applicable in a situation such as that of the applicant in the main proceedings, since, even though Paragraph 48 of the EGBGB is, in principle, applicable to the applicant, nevertheless he does not satisfy the condition of habitual residence in another Member State required by that provision. According to the German Government, the procedure laid down by the Law on changes of name allows a person, in a situation comparable to that of the applicant in the main proceedings, to acquire the right to bear the name obtained under the law of another Member State by making an application to that effect to the competent administrative authority.</p>

            <p>In the procedure providing for cooperation between national courts and the Court of Justice, it is for the latter to provide the national court with an answer which will be of use to it and enable it to determine the case before it. To that end, the Court may have to reformulate the questions referred to it (see, inter alia, judgment of 19 September 2013, Betriu Montull, C‑5/12, EU:C:2013:571, paragraph 40).</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the question raised by the referring court must be understood as asking, in essence, whether Articles 18 and 21 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding the registry office of a Member State from refusing to recognise and enter in the civil register the name legally acquired by a national of that Member State in another Member State, of which he is also a national, and which is the same as his birth name, on the basis of a provision of national law which makes the possibility of having such an entry made, by declaration to the registry office, subject to the condition that that name must have been acquired during a period of habitual residence in that other Member State, even though other provisions of national law allow the same national to make an application for a change of name to another authority, which has the discretionary power to decide on that application.</p>

Consequently, the applicant's situation should be examined in the light of that provision alone (judgment of 12 May 2011, Runevič-Vardyn and Wardyn, C‑391/09, EU:C:2011:291, paragraph 65; see, by analogy, judgment of 2 June 2016, Bogendorff von Wolffersdorff, C‑438/14, EU:C:2016:401, paragraph 34).</p>

            <p>It follows from settled case-law that although, as EU law stands at present, the rules governing the way in which a person's surname is entered on certificates of civil status are matters coming within the competence of the Member States, the latter must nonetheless, when exercising that competence, comply with EU law and, in particular, with the FEU Treaty provisions on the freedom of every citizen of the Union to move and reside in the territory of the Member States (judgments of 2 October 2003, Garcia Avello, C‑148/02, EU:C:2003:539, paragraph 25; of 14 October 2008, Grunkin and Paul, C‑353/06, EU:C:2008:559, paragraph 16; of 22 December 2010, Sayn-Wittgenstein, C‑208/09, EU:C:2010:806, paragraphs 38 and 39; of 12 May 2011, Runevič-Vardyn and Wardyn, C‑391/09, EU:C:2011:291, paragraph 63; and of 2 June 2016, Bogendorff von Wolffersdorff, C‑438/14, EU:C:2016:401, paragraph 32).</p>

            <p>It must be borne in mind that the Court has repeatedly held that national legislation which places certain of the nationals of the Member State concerned at a disadvantage simply because they have exercised their freedom to move and to reside in another Member State is a restriction on the freedoms conferred by Article 21(1) TFEU on every citizen of the Union (judgments of 14 October 2008, Grunkin and Paul, C‑353/06, EU:C:2008:559, paragraph 21; of 22 December 2010, Sayn-Wittgenstein, C‑208/09, EU:C:2010:806, paragraph 53; of 12 May 2011, Runevič-Vardyn and Wardyn, C‑391/09, EU:C:2011:291, paragraph 68; and of 2 June 2016, Bogendorff von Wolffersdorff, C‑438/14, EU:C:2016:401, paragraph 36).</p>

            <p>It also follows from the case-law of the Court that a refusal by the authorities of a Member State to recognise the name of a national of that State who exercised his right of free movement in the territory of another Member State, as determined in that second Member State, is likely to hinder the exercise of the right, enshrined in Article 21 TFEU, to move and reside freely in the territories of the Member States. Confusion and inconvenience are liable to arise from the divergence between the two names used for the same person (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 June 2016, Bogendorff von Wolffersdorff, C‑438/14, EU:C:2016:401, paragraph 37).</p>

            <p>Consequently, the refusal, by the registry office of a Member State, to recognise and enter in the civil registers the name legally acquired by a national of that Member State in another Member State of which he is also a national, on the basis of a provision of national law which makes the possibility of having such an entry made, by declaration to the registry office, subject to the condition that that name must have been acquired during a period of habitual residence in that other Member State, is likely to hinder the exercise of the right, enshrined in Article 21 TFEU, to move and reside freely in the territories of the Member States.</p>

            <p>The German Government nevertheless submits that, because German law includes other legal bases for changing a name at the request of the person concerned, namely the relevant provisions of the Law on changes of name, there is no obstacle to the free movement of persons which could stem from an inconsistent use of surnames. Although Paragraph 3(1) of the Law on changes of name makes such a change subject to the condition that it must be justified by a compelling reason, it follows from point 49 of the administrative provisions relating to the Law on changes of name that the elimination of a difference in surnames as regards German nationals with double nationality constitutes such a compelling reason. Thus, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, the individual concerned could obtain recognition of the name legally acquired in the other Member State by making an application under the Law on changes of name to the competent administrative authority.</p>

            <p>It is important, in particular, that the existing procedure under German law allowing for changes of name is such as to ensure that the existence of a `compelling reason' may be established in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings, in which the person concerned has connections to the Member State in which he acquired his name other than habitual residence, such as nationality, in order to allow the recognition of the name acquired in another Member State.</p>
