In addition, M granted GE Germany a royalty-free, non-exclusive licence to use the GE trade mark as it thought fit for the sale of the goods to other subsidiaries belonging to the GE Group, their use for test purposes or as samples, or for scrap.

If the reply to Question 1 is in the affirmative: can royalties or licence fees for trade marks within the meaning of Article 32(1)(c) of the [Customs] Code relate to the imported goods notwithstanding the fact that those royalties or licence fees are also paid for services and for the use of the first part of the name of the common group of undertakings? 3.

The customs value must thus reflect the real economic value of imported goods and therefore take into account all of the elements of such goods that have economic value (see, to that effect, judgments of 16 November 2006, Compaq Computer International Corporation, C‑306/04, EU:C:2006:716, paragraph 30, and of 16 June 2016, EURO 2004.

            <p>As stated in paragraph 30 above, the objective of EU law on the valuation of goods for customs purposes is to introduce a fair, uniform and neutral system excluding the use of arbitrary or fictitious customs values. In accordance with point 2 of the interpretative note on customs value concerning Article 31(1) of the Customs Code, set out in Annex 23 to Regulation No 2454/93, the methods of valuation to be used under Article 31(1) should be those laid down in Articles 29 and 30(2) of the Code but a `reasonable flexibility' in the application of those methods would be in conformity with the objectives and provisions of Article 31(1) of the Code (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 February 2008, Carboni e derivati, C‑263/06, EU:C:2008:128, paragraph 60).</p>

            <p>Having regard to the need to establish a customs value if an undertaking fails to provide full information relating to the relevant tax years and to the `reasonable flexibility' mentioned in point 2 of the interpretative note, it must be accepted that taking into account data relating to other tax years of the undertaking may constitute data available in the European Union which Article 31(1) of the Customs Code allows to be used as a basis for determining customs value. Reference to such data constitutes a means of determining a customs value which is both `reasonable' within the meaning of Article 31(1) and consistent with the principles and general provisions of the international agreements and the provisions referred to in Article 31(1) (see, by analogy, judgment of 28 February 2008, Carboni e derivati, C‑263/06, EU:C:2008:128, paragraph 61).</p>

            <p>As regards Article 158(3) of Regulation No 2454/93, this provides that if royalties or licence fees relate partly to the imported goods and partly to other ingredients or component parts added to the goods after their importation, or to post-importation activities or services, an appropriate apportionment `shall to be made only on the basis of objective and quantifiable data', in accordance with the interpretative note on Article 32(2) of the Customs Code in Annex 23 to Regulation No 2454/93.</p>

            <p>It follows from paragraph 81 above, and from point 91 of the Advocate General's Opinion, that data relating to other tax years of the undertaking in question may be regarded as `objective and quantifiable' within the meaning of Article 158(3) of Regulation No 2454/93 and, accordingly, that the apportionment provided for in that article may be applicable.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, as the Commission and the German Government submit, to hold otherwise could give rise to undue advantages for importers who refused to provide full information, thereby preventing proper determination of the customs value of the imported goods.</p>

            <p>Having regard to the foregoing, the answer to the fourth question is that Article 32(1)(c) of the Customs Code and Article 158(3) of Regulation No 2454/93 must be interpreted as meaning that the adjustment and apportionment measures, referred to in those provisions respectively, may be applied where the customs value of the goods at issue has been determined, not on the basis of Article 29 of the Customs Code, but on the basis of the alternative method laid down in Article 31 of that code.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fifth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 32(1)(c) of Council Regulation (EEC) No 2913/92 of 12 October 1992 establishing the Community Customs Code, as amended by Council Regulation (EC) No 1791/2006 of 20 November 2006, must be interpreted as, first, not requiring the amount of royalties or licence fees to be determined at the time when a licence agreement was concluded or when the customs debt was incurred in order for those royalties or licence fees to be regarded as related to the goods being valued and, second, allowing such royalties or licence fees to be `related to the goods being valued' even if those royalties or licence fees relate only partly to those goods. 2. Article 32(1)(c) of Regulation No 2913/92, as amended by Regulation No 1791/2006, and Article 160 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 2454/93 of 2 July 1993 laying down provisions for the implementation of Regulation No 2913/92, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 1875/2006 of 18 December 2006, must be interpreted as meaning that royalties or licence fees are a `condition of sale' of the goods being valued where, within a single group of undertakings, those royalties or licence fees are required to be paid by an undertaking related to both the seller and the buyer and were paid to that same undertaking. 3. Article 32(1)(c) of Regulation No 2913/92, as amended by Regulation No 1791/2006, and Article 158(3) of Regulation No 2454/93, as amended by Regulation No 1875/2006, must be interpreted as meaning that the adjustment and apportionment measures, referred to in those provisions respectively, may be applied where the customs value of the goods at issue has been determined, not on the basis of Article 29 of Regulation No 2913/92, as amended, but on the basis of the alternative method laid down in Article 31 of that regulation.</p>
