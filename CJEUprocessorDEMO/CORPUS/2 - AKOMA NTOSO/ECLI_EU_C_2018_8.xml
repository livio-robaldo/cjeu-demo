            <p>33 By its second question, which it is appropriate to examine first, the referring court asks essentially whether Article 25(2) of the CISA must be interpreted as meaning that, where a Contracting State intends to expel and impose a ban on entry and stay in the Schengen Area on a third-country national who holds a valid residence permit issued by another Contracting State, the consultation procedure provided for in that provision must be initiated by the first State before the issue of a return decision accompanied by an entry ban to that third-country national, or whether it can be initiated after the adoption of that decision.</p>

          <content eId="para_19693__content">
            <p>As is clear from the wording of most of the language versions of Article 25(2), first subparagraph, of the CISA, it is only where an alert for the purposes of refusing entry has been entered in the Schengen Information System for an alien who holds a valid residence permit issued by one of the Contracting Parties that the Contracting State entering the alert must consult the Contracting State which issued the residence permit.</p>

          <content eId="para_19694__content">

          <content eId="para_19695__content">
            <p>It follows that the consultation procedure provided for in Article 25(2) must, in principle, be initiated only after an alert for the purposes of refusing entry has been entered in the Schengen Information System for a third-country national and, therefore, once a return decision accompanied by an entry ban have been issued to him.</p>

          <content eId="para_19696__content">
            <p>However, and in order to give a full answer to the referring court, it must be added that Article 25(2) of the CISA does not prohibit the Contracting State, which seeks to expel and ban entry and residence in the Schengen Area such a third-country national, from initiating the consultation procedure laid down in that provision before the issue of a return decision accompanied by an entry ban to him.</p>

            <p>Having regard, on one hand, to the objective pursued in Article 25(2) of the CISA, which is to avoid a contradictory situation in which a third-country national is both holder of a valid residence permit issued by a Contracting State and the subject of an alert for the purposes of refusing entry in the Schengen Information System and, on the other hand, the principle of loyal cooperation as set out in Article 4(3) TEU, the consultation procedure should be initiated as soon as possible.</p>

          <content eId="para_19698__content">
            <p>Therefore, the answer to the second question is that Article 25(2) of the CISA must be interpreted as meaning that it is open to the Contracting State which intends to issue a return decision accompanied by a ban on entry and stay in the Schengen Area to a third-country national who holds a valid residence permit issued by another Contracting State to initiate the consultation procedure laid down in that provision even before the issue of the return decision. That procedure must, in any event, be initiated as soon as such a decision has been issued.</p>

              <p>The third and fourth questions</p>
            </tblock>
            <p>40 By its third and fourth questions, which it is appropriate to answer together, the referring court asks essentially about the inferences to be drawn by the Contracting State which initiated the consultation procedure under Article 25(2) of the CISA from the failure of the Contracting State consulted to respond, in particular, as regards the enforcement of the return decision and the ban on entry to the Schengen Area issued to a third-country national who is the holder of a valid residence permit issued by the latter State.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, it must be recalled, in particular, that the CISA before being amended by Regulation No 562/2006, laid down the conditions which must be satisfied by third-country nationals for entry and residence of less than three months in the Schengen Area. However, residence permits for a period of more than 90 days are covered, for the most part, by the national legislation of the Member States, without prejudice to those entry conditions. Furthermore, the issue by a Contracting State of such a residence permit, in accordance with Article 21 of the CISA, entitles the holder to the right to free movement for a maximum of three months in the other Contracting States, provided that he satisfies the conditions set out in that article.</p>

            <p>In accordance with Article 1 thereof, Directive 2008/115 lays down the common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals.

            <p>It follows from all of the foregoing considerations that any decision adopted by a Member State on the entry into and residence of a third-country national, in accordance with Regulation No 562/2006 and any return decision and ban on entry of such a third-country national issued by such a Member State under Directive 2008/115 produces effects for the other Member States and other Contracting States of the CISA.</p>

            <p>In the present case, it should be borne in mind that E, the holder of a valid residence permit issued by the Spanish State, is staying illegally in Finland, that a return decision accompanied by a ban on entry to the Schengen Area has been issued to him on the ground that he is regarded by the Finnish authorities as posing a threat to public order and national security, that those authorities initiated the consultation period laid down in Article 25(2) of the CISA on 26 January 2015, and that until now the Spanish authorities have failed to indicate their intentions concerning the maintenance or withdrawal of E's residence permit.</p>

            <p>First, as regards the possibility for the Finnish authorities to issue a return decision accompanied by an entry ban to E in those circumstances, it is clear from the wording of Article 6(2) of Directive 2008/115 that those authorities were required to issue such a return decision and, in accordance with Article 11 thereof, to accompany it with an entry ban, provided that public order and national security so require which is, however, for the national court to ascertain in the light of the relevant case-law of the Court (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 June 2015, Zh.

            <p>In that case, it must be recalled that a Member State is required to assess the concept of `risk to public policy', within the meaning of Article 7(4) of Directive 2008/115 on a case-by-case basis, in order to ascertain whether the personal conduct of the third-country national concerned poses a genuine and present risk to public policy, bearing in mind that the mere fact that that national has been criminally convicted is not sufficient by itself to present such a risk (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 June 2015, Zh.

            <p>Second, as regards the possibility for those authorities to enforce such a decision in the circumstances of the case in the main proceedings, it must be recalled that, in accordance with Article 8 of Directive 2008/115, the Finnish authorities are entitled to expel E without delay, without prejudice to E's right to rely on the rights he derives from the residence permit issued by the Spanish authorities by subsequently going to Spain. The fact that the consultation procedure laid down by Article 25(2) of the CISA is still ongoing does not call into question that interpretation.</p>

            <p>Article 25(2) of the CISA does not preclude the issue of an alert for the purposes of refusing entry in the Schengen Information System even though the consultation procedure laid down in that provision is ongoing as is clear from paragraph 39 of the present judgment.

          <content eId="para_19710__content">
            <p>In that connection, it must be recalled that Article 25(2) of the CISA aims to prevent, by means of the consultation procedure which is a situation in which with respect to the same third-country national an alert for the purposes of reusing entry has been issued by one Contracting State and a valid residence permit has been issued by another Contracting State.</p>

However, after a reasonable time from the initiation of the consultation procedure and in the absence of a response from the Contracting State consulted, the Contracting State issuing the alert for the purposes of refusing entry must withdraw that alert and, if necessary, put the third-country national on its national list of alerts.</p>

            <p>In that connection, although that provision governs the procedure between the authorities of Contracting States, the fact remains that it is likely to have tangible effects on the rights and interests of individuals.</p>

            <p>It must be recalled that that provision lays down in a clear, precise and unconditional manner a consultation procedure which must be initiated by a Contracting State seeking to ban the entry in the Schengen Area of a third-country national who is the holder of a valid residence permit issued by another Contracting State. Furthermore, if the second State considers that it is appropriate to maintain the residence permit it issued, that gives rise to an obligation which is also a clear, precise and unconditional on the first State to withdraw the alert for the purpose of refusing entry and, if necessary, to convert it into an alert on its national list.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, it must be held that an individual such as E may rely before the national courts on the consultation procedure laid down in Article 25(2) of the CISA and, in particular, on the obligations on the State issuing the alert, to initiate that procedure and, depending on the outcome of that procedure, to withdraw the alert for the purposes of refusing entry to the Schengen Area concerning him.</p>

            <p>Therefore, the answer to the first question is that Article 25(2) of the CISA must be interpreted as meaning that a third-country national who is the holder of a valid residence permit issued by a Contracting State, and to whom a return decision accompanied by an entry ban has been issued in another Contracting State, may rely before the national courts on the legal effects deriving from the consultation procedure on the Contracting State issuing the alert and the requirements deriving therefrom.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fifth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 25(1) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement of 14 June 1985 between the Governments of the States of the Benelux Economic Union, the Federal Republic of Germany and the French Republic on the gradual abolition of checks at their common borders, signed at Schengen on 19 June 1990 and which entered into force on 26 March 1995 must be interpreted as meaning that it is open to the Contracting State which intends to issue a return decision accompanied by a ban on entry and stay in the Schengen Area to a third-country national who holds a valid residence permit issued by another Contracting State to initiate the consultation procedure laid down in that provision even before the issue of the return decision. That procedure must, in any event, be initiated as soon as such a decision has been issued. 2. Article 25(2) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement must be interpreted as meaning that it does not preclude the return decision accompanied by an entry ban issued by a Contracting State to a third-country national who is the holder of a valid residence permit issued by another Contracting State being enforced even though the consultation procedure laid down in that provision is ongoing, if that third-country national is regarded by the Contracting State issuing the alert as representing a threat to public order or national security, without prejudice to that third-country national's entitlement to rely on the rights he derives from that residence permit by going subsequently to the territory of the second Contracting State. However, after a reasonable time from the initiation of the consultation procedure and in the absence of a response from the Contracting State consulted, the Contracting State issuing the alert for the purposes of refusing entry must withdraw it and, if necessary, put the third-country national on its national list of alerts. 3. Article 25(2) of the Convention implementing the Schengen Agreement must be interpreted as meaning that a third-country national who is the holder of a valid residence permit issued by a Contracting State, and to whom a return decision accompanied by an entry ban has been issued in another Contracting State, may rely before the national courts on the legal effects deriving from the consultation procedure on the Contracting State issuing the alert and the requirements deriving therefrom.</p>
