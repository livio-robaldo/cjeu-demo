            <p>By decision of 1 October 2015, the Office rejected F's application for asylum. In that regard, although it considered that F's statements were not fundamentally contradictory, it nonetheless concluded that F lacked credibility on the basis of an expert's report prepared by a psychologist. That expert's report entailed an exploratory examination, an examination of personality and several personality tests, namely the `Draw-A-Person-In-The-Rain' test and the Rorschach and Szondi tests, and concluded that it was not possible to confirm F's assertion relating to his sexual orientation.</p>

            <p>It must be noted that the statements made by an applicant for international protection relating to his sexual orientation constitute, having regard to the particular context in which applications for international protection are made, merely the starting point in the process of assessment of the facts and circumstances envisaged under Article 4 of Directive 2011/95 (see, by analogy, judgment of 2 December 2014, A and Others, C‑148/13 to C‑150/13, EU:C:2014:2406, paragraph 49).</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be recalled that sexual orientation is a characteristic which is capable of proving an applicant's membership of a particular social group, within the meaning of Article 2(d) of Directive 2011/95, where the group of persons whose members share the same sexual orientation is perceived by the surrounding society as being different (see, to that effect, judgment of 7 November 2013, X and Others, C‑199/12 to C‑201/12, EU:C:2013:720, paragraphs 46 and 47), as is confirmed, moreover, by Article 10(1)(d) of that directive.</p>

Those conditions include, in particular, the fact that the applicant's statements are found to be coherent and plausible and do not run counter to available specific and general information relevant to his case, as well as the fact that the applicant's general credibility has been established.</p>

            <p>Therefore, even if the performance of the psychological tests on which an expert's report, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, is based is formally conditional upon the consent of the person concerned, it must be considered that that consent is not necessarily given freely, being de facto imposed under the pressure of the circumstances in which applicants for international protection find themselves (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 December 2014, A and Others, C‑148/13 to C‑150/13, EU:C:2014:2406, paragraph 66).</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, as the Advocate General noted in point 43 of his Opinion, the preparation and use of a psychologist's expert report such as that at issue in the main proceedings constitutes an interference with that person's right to respect for his private life.</p>

            <p>In this context, although interference with an applicant's private life can be justified by the search for information enabling his actual need for international protection to be assessed, it is for the determining authority to assess, under the court's supervision, whether a psychologist's expert report which it intends to commission or wishes to take into account is appropriate and necessary in order to achieve that objective.</p>

            <p>In this respect, it should be noted that the suitability of an expert's report such as that at issue in the main proceedings may be accepted only if it is based on sufficiently reliable methods and principles in the light of the standards recognised by the international scientific community. It should be noted in that regard that, although it is not for the Court to rule on this issue, which is, as an assessment of the facts, a matter within the national court's jurisdiction, the reliability of such an expert's report has been vigorously contested by the French and Netherlands Governments as well as by the Commission.</p>

            <p>In any event, the impact of an expert's report such as that at issue in the main proceedings on the applicant's private life seems disproportionate to the aim pursued, since the seriousness of the interference with the right to privacy it constitutes cannot be regarded as proportionate to the benefit that it may possibly represent for the assessment of the facts and circumstances set out in Article 4 of Directive 2011/95.</p>

            <p>In the first place, the interference with the private life of the applicant for international protection arising from the preparation and use of an expert's report, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, is, in view of its nature and subject matter, particularly serious.</p>

            <p>It is also necessary to take account, in order to assess the seriousness of the interference arising from the preparation and use of a psychologist's expert report, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, of Principle 18 of the Yogyakarta principles on the application of International Human Rights Law in relation to Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity, to which the French and Netherlands Governments have referred, which states, inter alia, that no person may be forced to undergo any form of psychological test on account of his sexual orientation or gender identity.</p>

            <p>When those elements are looked at together, it is apparent that the seriousness of the interference with private life entailed by the preparation and use of an expert's report, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, exceeds that entailed by an assessment of the statements of the applicant for international protection relating to a fear of persecution on grounds of his sexual orientation or recourse to a psychologist's expert report having a purpose other than that of establishing the applicant's sexual orientation.</p>

            <p>On the one hand, the carrying out of a personal interview conducted by the personnel of the determining authority is such as to contribute to the assessment of those statements, inasmuch as both Article 13(3)(a) of Directive 2005/85 and Article 15(3)(a) of Directive 2013/32 provide that the Member States must ensure that the person who conducts the interview is competent to take account of the personal circumstances surrounding the application, those circumstances covering in particular the applicant's sexual orientation.</p>

            <p>Second, it is apparent from Article 4(5) of Directive 2011/95 that, where the Member States apply the principle that it is the duty of the applicant to substantiate his application, the applicant's statements concerning his sexual orientation which are not substantiated by documentary evidence or evidence of another kind do not need confirmation when the conditions set out in that provision are fulfilled: those conditions refer, inter alia, to the consistency and plausibility of those statements and do not make any mention of the preparation or use of an expert's report.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, even assuming that an expert's report based on projective personality tests, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, may contribute to identifying with a degree of reliability the sexual orientation of the person concerned, it follows from the statements of the referring court that the conclusions of such an expert's report are only capable of giving an indication of that sexual orientation. Accordingly, those conclusions are, in any event, approximate in nature and are therefore of only limited interest for the purpose of assessing the statements of an applicant for international protection, in particular where, as in the case at issue in the main proceedings, those statements are not contradictory.</p>

Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 4 of Directive 2011/95/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on standards for the qualification of third-country nationals or stateless persons as beneficiaries of international protection, for a uniform status for refugees or for persons eligible for subsidiary protection, and for the content of the protection granted, must be interpreted as meaning that it does not preclude the authority responsible for examining applications for international protection, or, where an action has been brought against a decision of that authority, the courts or tribunals seised, from ordering that an expert's report be obtained in the context of the assessment of the facts and circumstances relating to the declared sexual orientation of an applicant, provided that the procedures for such a report are consistent with the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, that that authority and those courts or tribunals do not base their decision solely on the conclusions of the expert's report and that they are not bound by those conclusions when assessing the applicant's statements relating to his sexual orientation. 2. Article 4 of Directive 2011/95, read in the light of Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, must be interpreted as precluding the preparation and use, in order to assess the veracity of a claim made by an applicant for international protection concerning his sexual orientation, of a psychologist's expert report, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, the purpose of which is, on the basis of projective personality tests, to provide an indication of the sexual orientation of that applicant.</p>
