            <p>Verwertungsgesellschaft Rundfunk brought an action before the Handelsgericht Wien (Commercial Court, Vienna, Austria) seeking an order that Hettegger Hotel Edelweiss, first, provide it with information on the radio and television programmes that could be received and the number of hotel rooms concerned and, second, pay it damages.</p>

            <p>It claims, before that court, that Hettegger Hotel Edelweiss, by making available TV sets in its hotel rooms and by communicating the television and radio broadcasts by means of those TV sets, performs an act of communication to the public within the meaning of Paragraph 76a of the UrhG and Article 8(3) of Directive 2006/115. According to the applicant, the price of the room must be regarded as an entrance fee within the meaning of those provisions, in so far as the offer of a television in the hotel has an influence on that price. It submits, as a consequence, that that communication to the public of the broadcasts of the beneficiaries that it represents must be subject to the authorisation of those beneficiaries and to the payment of fees.</p>

            <p>Hettegger Hotel Edelweiss contests those claims by arguing that the existence of a communication to the public within the meaning of Paragraph 76a of the UrhG presupposes a communication in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee and that that expression refers to an entrance fee demanded specifically for that communication. Therefore, the price that the hotel guest must pay in consideration for the overnight stay cannot, in its view, be regarded as an entrance fee.</p>

            <p>By its question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 8(3) of Directive 2006/115 must be interpreted as meaning that the communication of television and radio broadcasts by means of TV sets installed in hotel rooms constitutes a communication made in a place accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee.</p>

            <p>As regards Directive 2006/115, of which an interpretation is sought, the Court also held, in the judgment of 15 March 2012, Phonographic Performance (Ireland) ( C‑162/10, EU:C:2012:141, paragraph 47) that a hotel operator which provides in guest bedrooms televisions and/or radios to which it distributes a broadcast signal makes a communication to the public for the purposes of Article 8(2) of Directive 2006/115.</p>

            <p>As the concepts used by those directives must have the same meaning, unless the EU legislature has expressed a different intention (see, to that effect, judgments of 4 October 2011, Football Association Premier League and Others, C‑403/08 and C‑429/08, EU:C:2011:631, paragraph 188, and of 31 May 2016, Reha Training, C‑117/15, EU:C:2016:379, paragraph 33), the provision of a signal by means of television or radio sets installed in hotel rooms must also, as the Advocate General stated in point 16 of his Opinion, constitute a communication to the public of broadcasts from broadcasting organisations within the meaning of Article 8(3) of Directive 2006/115.</p>

            <p>However, unlike, in particular, the exclusive right of performers and the right of phonogram producers provided for in Article 8(1) and (2) of Directive 2006/115 respectively, the exclusive right of broadcasters provided for in Article 8(3) is limited to cases of communication to the public in places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee.</p>

            <p>As regards interpreting the concept of `places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee', it is apparent from recital 7 of Directive 2006/115 that it seeks to approximate the legislation of the Member States in such a way as not to conflict, in particular, with the Rome Convention. Accordingly, although that convention does not form part of the legal order of the European Union, concepts appearing in Directive 2006/15 must be interpreted in particular in the light of that convention, in such a way that they are compatible with the equivalent concepts contained in that convention, taking account also of the context in which those concepts are found and the purpose of the relevant provisions of the convention (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 March 2012, SCT, C‑135/10, EU:C:2012:140, paragraphs 53 to 56).</p>

            <p>In the present case, the scope of the right of communication to the public laid down in Article 8(3) of Directive 2006/115 is equivalent to that of the right provided for in Article 13(d) of the Rome Convention, which, in accordance with the wording of Article 8(3), limits it to `places accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee' (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 September 2014, Commission v Council, C‑114/12, EU:C:2014:2151, paragraphs 94 to 96). The intention of the EU legislature was -- as confirmed by the amended proposal for a directive, of 30 April 1992 (COM(92) 159 final, p. 12), which led to the adoption of Council Directive 92/100/EEC of 19 November 1992 on rental right and lending right and on certain rights related to copyright in the field of intellectual property ( OJ 1992 L 346, p. 61), which was repealed and codified by Directive 2006/115 -- to follow to a large extent the provisions of the Rome Convention introducing minimum protection in order to achieve uniform minimum protection in the European Union and, by modelling Article 6a(3) of the proposed Directive on Article 13(d) of the Rome Convention, to provide for an exclusive right to communicate television broadcasts to the public under the conditions set out in that convention.</p>

            <p>As regards the condition for the payment of an entrance fee provided for in Article 13(d) of the Rome Convention, it should be pointed out that, according to the Guide to the Rome Convention and to the Phonograms Convention of the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO), a document prepared by the WIPO which, without being legally binding, provides explanations as to the origin, purpose, nature and scope of that convention, points 13.5 and 13.6 of which relate to Article 13 of the Rome Convention, that condition presupposes a payment specifically requested in return for a communication to the public of a TV broadcast and that, accordingly, the fact of payment for a meal or drinks in a restaurant or in a bar where TV broadcasts are aired is not to be regarded as a payment of an entrance fee within the meaning of that provision.</p>

        <paragraph eId="para_1654">
          <num>24</num>
          <content eId="para_1654__content">
            <p>The fact remains that, as the Advocate General stated in points 26 to 30 of his Opinion, the price of a hotel room is not, like the price of a restaurant service, an entrance fee specifically requested in return for a communication to the public of a TV or radio broadcast, but constitutes the consideration for, principally, the accommodation service, to which, according to the hotel category, certain additional services are added, such as the communication of TV and radio broadcasts by means of receiving equipment in the rooms, which are normally included in the price of the overnight stay.</p>

            <p>Therefore, although the distribution of a signal by means of TV and radio sets installed in hotel rooms constitutes an additional service which has an influence on the hotel's standing and, therefore, on the price of rooms, as pointed out by the Court in its judgments of 7 December 2006, SGAE ( C‑306/05, EU:C:2006:764, paragraph 44) and of 15 March 2012, Phonographic Performance (Ireland) ( C‑162/10, EU:C:2012:141, paragraph 44), in the context of the examination of the existence of an act of communication to the public within the meaning of Article 3(1) of Directive 2001/29 and of Article 8(2) of Directive 2006/115, it cannot be considered that that additional service is offered in a place accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee within the meaning of Article 8(3) of that directive.</p>

            <p>In the light of all of the foregoing, the answer to the question referred is that Article 8(3) of Directive 2006/115 must be interpreted as meaning that the communication of television and radio broadcasts by means of TV sets installed in hotel rooms does not constitute a communication made in a place accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules: Article 8(3) of Directive 2006/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on rental right and lending right and on certain rights related to copyright in the field of intellectual property must be interpreted as meaning that the communication of television and radio broadcasts by means of TV sets installed in hotel rooms does not constitute a communication made in a place accessible to the public against payment of an entrance fee.</p>
