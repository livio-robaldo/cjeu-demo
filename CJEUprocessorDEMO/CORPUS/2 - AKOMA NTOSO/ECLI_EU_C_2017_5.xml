            <p>By application lodged at the Registry of the General Court on 15 April 2013, Mr Typke brought an action seeking the annulment, first, of the decision at issue, adopted in the course of the procedure GESTDEM 2012/3258, and, secondly, of the implied refusal of access to the documents to which his second application related, adopted in the course of the procedure GESTDEM 2013/0068.</p>

            <p>By the judgment under appeal, the General Court found that the implied refusal had been replaced by an express decision of 27 May 2013 and that, therefore, there was no longer any need to adjudicate on the action in so far as it was directed against that implied decision. Since the appellant's request seeking to extend his action to the express decision of 27 May 2013 was submitted after the expiry of the time limit for bringing an action for annulment against that decision, the General Court dismissed that claim for annulment as inadmissible.</p>

            <p>As regards the claims directed against the decision at issue, the General Court found that the application for access did not relate to access, even partial, to one or more existing documents held by EPSO, but, on the contrary, sought that the Commission create new documents which cannot simply be extracted from a database by means of a normal or routine search using an existing search tool. On those grounds, the General Court dismissed the action.</p>

            <p>Following the delivery of the Opinion of the Advocate General on 21 September 2016, Mr Typke, by a document lodged at the Court Registry on 7 November 2016, applied for the oral part of the procedure to be reopened. In support of that application, he submits, in essence, that the Advocate General raised an argument relating to the interpretation of the notion of `existing document' for the purposes of Regulation No 1049/2001 which was not debated by the parties before the Court.</p>

            <p>By his first ground of appeal, the appellant alleges that the General Court committed several errors of law inasmuch as it held that granting access to the information for which he had applied was tantamount to the creation of a new document.</p>

          <content eId="para_11541__content">
            <p>In the first place, the appellant submits that, contrary to what is stated in paragraphs 54 and 58 of the judgment under appeal, it is apparent from paragraphs 110, 112, 116 and 118 of the judgment of 26 October 2011, Dufour v ECB ( T‑436/09, EU:T:2011:634) that a normalised relational database, such as that containing the information requested by the appellant, should be construed as a single document. Consequently, the General Court erred in making a distinction between the information contained in a database and the documents which can be extracted from that database.</p>

        <paragraph eId="para_11542">
          <num>24</num>
          <content eId="para_11542__content">
            <p>It follows from paragraphs 93, 94, 108 and 109 of that judgment that the notion of document for the purposes of Regulation No 1049/2001 also includes any individual file and each occurrence of its content in a database. Likewise, every combination of data extracted from various files would be a document since any search is possible in a normalised database.</p>

          <num>25</num>
          <content eId="para_11543__content">
            <p>In the second place, in paragraphs 68 to 70 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court incorrectly interpreted the notion of `existing document' for the purposes of Regulation No 1049/2001. It is apparent from paragraph 150 of the judgment of 26 October 2011, Dufour v ECB ( T‑436/09, EU:T:2011:634), that any application for access to information contained in a database is deemed to concern an `existing document' for the purposes of Article 2(3) of Regulation No 1049/2001, provided that the search called for can be carried out using the `search tools available' for that database.</p>
          </content>

        <paragraph eId="para_11544">
          <num>26</num>
          <content eId="para_11544__content">
            <p>In the case of a normalised relational database, the search tools available are management systems which react to Structured Query Language ( `SQL') queries. Those are search queries that a user may formulate in the way he chooses. Consequently, the General Court was incorrect to find that the formulation of an SQL query which is not already used for the management of a database is tantamount to the programming of a new search tool which is therefore not `available' within the meaning of the judgment of 26 October 2011, Dufour v ECB ( T‑436/09, EU:T:2011:634).</p>
          </content>

          <num>27</num>
          <content eId="para_11545__content">
            <p>In doing so, the General Court incorrectly concluded that normal or routine searches within the meaning of paragraph 153 of that judgment are those made using preprogrammed SQL queries.</p>

          <num>28</num>
          <content eId="para_11546__content">
            <p>Lastly, in the third place, the interpretation given by the General Court to the notion of `existing document' would be liable to render Regulation No 1049/2001 ineffective. Thus, access would be excluded to all information for which a preprogrammed SQL query does not exist. The institutions might therefore be tempted to conceal electronic documents, in particular by dividing them into several parts which could not be found by preprogrammed SQL queries. Furthermore, since the institutions would be prevented from using new SQL queries, it would be difficult to conceal by automised means data covered by one or several of the exceptions provided for in Article 4 of that regulation, such as personal data.</p>

            <p>The Court has already held that the right of access to documents of the institutions applies only to existing documents in the possession of the institution concerned and that Regulation No 1049/2001 may not be relied upon to oblige an institution to create a document which does not exist (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 October 2014, Strack v Commission, C‑127/13 P, EU:C:2014:2250, paragraphs 38 and 46). It follows that, as the General Court correctly held in paragraph 55 of the judgment under appeal, an application for access that would require the Commission to create a new document, even if that document were based on information already appearing in existing documents held by it, falls outside the framework of Regulation No 1049/2001.</p>

            <p>The General Court was therefore correct in examining, inter alia in paragraphs 56 to 59 of the judgment under appeal, the issue of to what extent the extraction of information contained in an electronic database allows an existing document to be generated rather than being tantamount to the creation of a new document.</p>

            <p>It is not disputed that the information contained in databases, depending on the structure and the restrictions imposed by the programming of such databases, may be regrouped, linked and presented in different ways using programming languages.

Those users access information contained in a database by using preprogrammed search tools. Those tools enable them to perform standardised operations easily in order to display the information which they usually need.

            <p>First, he claims that in paragraphs 61, 67 and 73 of the judgment under appeal the General Court distorted the facts. According to the appellant, his application did refer to existing documents in so far as it related to access to a set of documents, in electronic form, enabling him to reconstruct a table. He did not on the other hand require the creation of that table and therefore his application did not prescribe any selection of data. It was only to facilitate the treatment of that application that the appellant proposed the use of SQL queries.</p>

Furthermore, each field in the tables in a normalised database is associated with a unique identifier.

The appellant contested that statement, which is contradicted by the very nature of the database concerned.
