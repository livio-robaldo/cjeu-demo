            <p>In those circumstances, the Rechtbank Amsterdam (District Court, Amsterdam) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling: `Must the first sentence of Article 28(2) of Framework Decision 2008/909 be understood as meaning that the declaration referred to therein may relate only to judgments issued before 5 December 2011, irrespective of when those judgments became final, or must that provision be understood as meaning that the declaration may relate only to judgments which became final before 5 December 2011?'</p>

          <content eId="para_7469__content">
            <p>By its question, the referring court asks essentially whether Article 28(2), first sentence, of the Framework Decision 2008/909 must be interpreted as meaning that it covers judgments pronounced before the date indicated by the Member State concerned, which cannot be later than 5 December 2011, or whether it should be interpreted as meaning that it covers only judgments which have become final after that date.</p>

          <content eId="para_7470__content">
            <p>In order to answer that question, it must be recalled, first of all, that Article 1(a) of the Framework Decision 2008/909 defines a `judgment' as a final decision or order of a court of the issuing State imposing a sentence on a natural person. Under Article 3(1) thereof, that framework decision is intended to lay down rules enabling a Member State, with a view to facilitating the social rehabilitation of the sentenced person, to recognise a judgment and enforce the sentence. According to Article 3(3) of the Framework Decision, the latter applies only to the recognition of judgments and the enforcement of sentences within the meaning of that framework decision.</p>

          <content eId="para_7471__content">
            <p>Therefore, the substantive scope of Framework Decision 2008/909 is limited to judgments which have become final, with a view to their recognition and enforcement by the executing State, to the exclusion of decisions subject to appeal, such as judgments, like the judgment in the main proceedings of the Hof van beroep Antwerpen (Court of Appeal, Antwerp) of 28 February 2011, against which an appeal on point of law was brought before the Hof van Cassatie (Court of Cassation), and which became final only after the latter court dismissed the appeal on 6 December 2011.</p>

            <p>Next, it must be observed that, according to settled case-law, the need for a uniform application of EU law and the principle of equality require that the terms of a provision of EU law which makes no express reference to the law of the Member States for the purpose of determining its meaning and scope must normally be given an independent and uniform interpretation throughout the European Union (judgment of 28 July 2016, JZ, C‑294/16 PPU, EU:2016:610, paragraph 35).</p>

          <content eId="para_7473__content">
            <p>Article 1(a) of Framework Decision 2008/909, which defines the concept of `judgment' as a final decision, does not contain any reference to the law of the Member States, so that it must be held that that concept is an autonomous concept of EU law that must be given an autonomous and uniform interpretation throughout the European Union. To that end, account must also be taken of the terms of that provision, its context and the objectives of the legislation of which it forms part (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 July 2016, JZ, C‑294/16 PPU, EU:2016:610, paragraph 37).</p>

          <content eId="para_7474__content">
            <p>In that connection, although the terms of Article 28(2) of the Framework Decision 2008/909 are ambiguous, the reference made in that provision to a `final judgment' militates in favour of an interpretation according to which that provision covers the latter judgment which is issued in criminal proceedings and which makes final the sentence imposed on the person sentenced. That interpretation is supported by the definition of `judgment' in Article 1(a) thereof. In that connection, the fact that both Article 1(a) and Article 28(2) refer to the `final' nature of the judgment concerned underlines the particular importance, for the purpose of the application of the latter provision, given to the unchallengeable nature of that judgment and, therefore, the date on which finality is acquired.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, since the definitions of `judgment' and `issue' of that judgment, in Article 28(2) of the Framework Decision 2008/909, must be given an independent and uniform interpretation in the EU, the scope of those definitions and, therefore, of that provision cannot depend either on the domestic criminal proceedings of the issuing Member State or that of the enforcing State.</p>

            <p>Therefore, an interpretation of Article 28(2) of Framework Decision 2008/909 according to which its application depends on the date on which a judgment is regarded as having been `issued' within the meaning of the national law concerned, independently of the date on which it became final, must be excluded.</p>

            <p>Finally, regarding the scheme and the objectives pursued by the legislation of which the relevant provision is part, it must be recalled, as the Advocate General observes in points 45 to 48 of his Opinion, that Article 28(2) of Framework Decision 2008/909 constitutes an exception to the general scheme of Article 28(1) thereof, which provides that requests for the enforcement of a judgment and enforcement of a sentence received after 5 December 2011 are to be governed by the rules adopted by Member States pursuant to that framework decision. As an exception to the general scheme, the first of those provisions must be strictly interpreted.</p>

            <p>By limiting the number of cases which continue to be covered by legal instruments existing before the entry into force of Framework Decision 2008/909 and, therefore, by increasing the number of cases which fall within the rules adopted by the Member States in implementation of that framework decision, a strict interpretation of Article 28(2), to the effect that that provision covers only judgments which became final by 5 December 2011 at the latest, is the most appropriate in order to guarantee the objective pursued by that framework decision. As is clear from Article 3(1) thereof, that objective consists in enabling the Member States to recognise the judgments and enforce the sentences they contain, with a view to facilitating the social rehabilitation of a sentenced person.</p>

            <p>In addition, the Austrian Government and the European Commission raised the question of the validity of the declaration made by the Kingdom of the Netherlands pursuant to Article 28(2) of Framework Decision 2008/909, having regard to the moment to which that declaration was made. Taking account of the interpretation adopted in the preceding paragraph of this judgment, that question is hypothetical, since the domestic provisions of the Netherlands implementing that framework decision are, in any event, applicable to the case in the main proceedings. In those circumstances, it is unnecessary to reply to that argument.</p>

            <p>It follows from the foregoing that the answer to the question referred for a preliminary ruling is that Article 28(2), first sentence, of Framework Decision 2008/909 must be interpreted as meaning that it covers only judgments which became final before the date indicated by the Member State concerned.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fifth Chamber) hereby rules: Article 28(2) of Council Framework Decision 2008/909/JHA of 27 November 2008 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to judgments in criminal matters imposing custodial sentences or measures involving deprivation of liberty for the purpose of their enforcement in the European Union must be interpreted as meaning that it covers only judgments which became final before the date specified by the Member State concerned.</p>
