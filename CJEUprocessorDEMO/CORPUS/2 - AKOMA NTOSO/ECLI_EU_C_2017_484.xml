            <p>Mr W was vaccinated against hepatitis B through three injections, administered on 26 December 1998, 29 January 1999 and 8 July 1999, of a vaccine produced by Sanofi Pasteur. From August 1999, Mr W began to present with various troubles, which led to a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in November 2000.</p>

            <p>On 1 March 2005, legal experts concluded that, as from 20 January 2001, due to his multiple sclerosis Mr W was no longer fit to work. Mr W's state of health continued to decline progressively until it reached a functional disability of 90% requiring round-the-clock care until the time of his death on 30 October 2011.</p>

            <p>In 2006, Mr W and W and Others, being three members of his family, brought proceedings on the basis of Article 1386-1 et seq. of the Civil Code, seeking to have Sanofi Pasteur ordered to pay compensation for the damage they claim to have suffered due to Mr W's having been administered the vaccine in question. In support of their claim, they pleaded that the short period between the vaccination and the appearance of the first symptoms of multiple sclerosis, in conjunction with the lack of any personal or family history of the disease, are such as to give rise to serious, specific and consistent presumptions as to the existence of a defect in the vaccine and as to there being a causal link between the injection of the vaccine and the occurrence of the multiple sclerosis.</p>

            <p>They relied in that regard on the case-law of the Cour de cassation (Court of Cassation, France), according to which, as stated by that court in its order for reference, in the area of liability of pharmaceutical laboratories for the vaccines they produce, proof of a causal link between the defect in the product and the damage suffered by the person injured can be derived from serious, specific and consistent presumptions, which falls within the remit of the court ruling on the merits in the exercise of its exclusive jurisdiction to appraise the facts.</p>

            <p>In particular, that case-law is very clear on the point that the court ruling on the merits, in the exercise of its exclusive jurisdiction to appraise the facts, may consider that the facts relied on by the applicant, such as the time lapse between the administering of the vaccine and the occurrence of a disease and the patient's lack of any personal or family history of the disease in question, constitute serious, specific and consistent presumptions capable of proving the defect in the vaccine and the existence of a causal relationship between it and the disease in question, notwithstanding the finding that medical research does not establish a relationship between the vaccine and the occurrence of the disease.</p>

            <p>The action brought by the family members of Mr W was upheld at first instance by the tribunal de grande instance de Nanterre (Regional Court, Nanterre, France) in a judgment of 4 September 2009. It was subsequently overturned on appeal by the cour d'appel de Versailles (Court of Appeal, Versailles, France) in a judgment of 10 February 2011. The latter court held that the evidence relied on by W and Others was sufficient to establish serious, specific and consistent presumptions capable of proving a causal relationship between the injection of the vaccine and the occurrence of the disease but were insufficient to establish a defect in the vaccine.</p>

            <p>An appeal against that judgment was brought before the Cour de cassation (Court of Cassation), which quashed it by judgment of 26 September 2012. In its judgment, the Cour de Cassation (Court of Cassation) held that, in ruling on the basis of general considerations relating to the cost/benefit ratio of the vaccination, after having acknowledged, given Mr W's previous excellent state of health, the lack of family antecedents and the close temporal connection between the vaccination and the appearance of the disease, that there were serious, specific and consistent presumptions supporting the conclusion that the causal link between the disease and the administering of the vaccine had been sufficiently established, without examining whether or not the particular circumstances recognised by it also constituted serious, specific and consistent presumptions establishing that the vaccine was defective, the cour d'appel de Versailles (Court of Appeal, Versailles) had failed to provide a legal basis for its decision.</p>

            <p>The case was sent before the cour d'appel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris, France), which again overturned the first instance judgment of the tribunal de grande instance de Nanterre (Regional Court, Nanterre) by judgment of 7 March 2014. The cour d'appel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) observed, firstly, that there was no scientific consensus supporting a causal relationship between the vaccination against hepatitis B and multiple sclerosis and that all the national and international health authorities had rejected the association between a likelihood of being affected by central or peripheral demyelinating disease (characteristic of multiple sclerosis) and the vaccination against hepatitis B. It considered, secondly, that according to multiple medical studies the aetiology of multiple sclerosis is currently unknown. Thirdly, a recent medical publication concluded that, at the time when the first symptoms of multiple sclerosis appear, the pathophysiological process probably commenced many months, or many years earlier. Fourthly and lastly, that court noted that epidemiological studies show that 92 to 95% of persons with multiple sclerosis had no antecedent of the disease in their family. In the light of those various elements, the cour d'appel de Paris (Court of Appeal, Paris) concluded that the criteria relating to temporal proximity between the vaccination and the first symptoms and the lack of personal and family antecedents relied on by W and Others could not, together or separately, establish serious, specific and consistent presumptions supporting the conclusion of there being a causal link between the vaccination and the disease in question.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, dealing with a new appeal on a point of law brought by W and Others against that judgment, the Cour de cassation decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling: `</p>

                <p>Must Article 4 of [Directive 85/374] be interpreted as precluding, in the area of liability of pharmaceutical laboratories for the vaccines that they manufacture, a method of proof by which the court ruling on the merits, in the exercise of its exclusive jurisdiction to appraise the facts, may consider that the facts relied on by the applicant constitute serious, specific and consistent presumptions capable of proving the defect in the vaccine and the existence of a causal relationship between it and the disease, notwithstanding the finding that medical research does not establish a relationship between the vaccine and the occurrence of the disease?</p>

                <num>(2)</num>
                <p>If the answer to Question 1 is in the negative, does Article 4 of Directive 85/374 ... preclude a system of presumptions by which the existence of a causal relationship between the defect attributed to a vaccine and the damage suffered by the injured person will always be considered to be established where certain indications of causation are found?</p>

                <num>(3)</num>
                <p>If the answer to Question 1 is in the affirmative, must Article 4 of Directive 85/374 ... be interpreted as meaning that proof, the burden of which rests on the person injured, of the existence of a causal relationship between the defect attributed to a vaccine and the damage suffered by that person cannot be considered to have been adduced unless the causal relationship is established scientifically?'</p>

                </tblock>
                <p>18 By its first question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 4 of Directive 85/374 must be interpreted as precluding national evidentiary rules such as those at issue in the main proceedings under which, when a court ruling on the merits of an action involving the liability of the producer of a vaccine due to an alleged defect in that vaccine, in the exercise of its exclusive jurisdiction to appraise the facts, may consider that, notwithstanding the finding that medical research neither establishes nor rules out the existence of a link between the administering of the vaccine and the occurrence of the victim's disease, certain factual evidence relied on by the applicant constitutes serious, specific and consistent evidence enabling it to conclude that there is a defect in the vaccine and that there is a causal link between that defect and that disease.</p>

          <content eId="para_10680__content">
            <p>It must be borne in mind as a preliminary point that whilst Article 1 of Directive 85/374 lays down the principle that producers are to be held liable for damage caused by a defect in their product, Article 4 of that directive clarifies that the injured person will be required to prove the damage, the defect and the causal relationship between the defect and the damage.</p>

          <content eId="para_10681__content">
            <p>Similarly, it must be remembered that, according to settled case-law, Directive 85/374 seeks to achieve, in the matters regulated by it, complete harmonisation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States (judgment of 20 November 2014, Novo Nordisk Pharma, C‑310/13, EU:C:2014:2385, paragraph 23 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_10682__content">
            <p>However, as can be seen from the 18th recital thereof, Directive 85/374 does not seek exhaustively to harmonise the sphere of liability for defective products beyond the matters regulated by it (judgment of 20 November 2014, Novo Nordisk Pharma, C‑310/13, EU:C:2014:2385, paragraph 24 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In that regard it should be noted at the outset that Directive 85/374 does not contain any definition of the concept of `causal relationship' within the meaning of Articles 1 and 4 thereof. By contrast, the concept of `defect' within the meaning of those articles is indeed defined in Article 6 thereof.</p>

In such a situation, there would be disregard not only of the rule on burden of proof laid down in Article 4 of Directive 85/374 but also, more generally, the effectiveness of the system of liability introduced by Article 1 of that directive, since the issue whether two of the three conditions on which producer's liability under that directive is contingent, namely the existence of a defect in the product and a causal link between that defect and the damage suffered by the victim, were met would not be sufficiently examined by the national court.</p>

            <p>Secondly, disregard of the burden of proof could also result if the national courts were to apply the evidentiary rules described in paragraph 28 of this judgment in such a way that, where one or more types of factual evidence were presented together, an immediate and automatic presumption would operate of there being a defect in the product and/or a causal link between that defect and the occurrence of the damage. In such circumstances, the producer could then find itself, even before the courts ruling on the merits of the case had the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the producer's evidence and arguments, in the position of having to rebut that presumption in order to defend itself successfully against the claim (see, by analogy, judgments of 9 November 1983, San Giorgio, 199/82, EU:C:1983:318, paragraph 14, and of 9 February 1999, Dilexport, C‑343/96, EU:C:1999:59, paragraph 52).</p>

This requires the court to safeguard its own freedom of assessment in determining whether such proof has been made out to the requisite legal standard, until such time as, having examined all the evidence adduced by both parties and the arguments exchanged by them, it considers itself in a position to draw a definitive conclusion on the matter, having regard to all the relevant circumstances of the case before it (see, by analogy, judgment of 9 November 1983, San Giorgio, 199/82, EU:C:1983:318, paragraph 14).</p>

That could be the case inter alia where that evidence leads the court to consider, first, that the administering of the vaccine is the most plausible explanation for the occurrence of the disease and, second, that the vaccine therefore does not offer the safety that one is entitled to expect, taking all circumstances into account, as provided for in Article 6 of that directive, because it causes abnormal and particularly serious damage to the patient who, in the light of the nature and function of the product, is entitled to expect a particularly high level of safety (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 March 2015, Boston Scientific Medizintechnik, C‑503/13 and C‑504/13, EU:C:2015:148, paragraph 39).</p>

            <p>In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the first question is that Article 4 of Directive 85/374 must be interpreted as not precluding national evidentiary rules such as those at issue in the main proceedings under which, when a court ruling on the merits of an action involving the liability of the producer of a vaccine due to an alleged defect in that vaccine, in the exercise of its exclusive jurisdiction to appraise the facts, may consider that, notwithstanding the finding that medical research neither establishes nor rules out the existence of a link between the administering of the vaccine and the occurrence of the victim's disease, certain factual evidence relied on by the applicant constitutes serious, specific and consistent evidence enabling it to conclude that there is a defect in the vaccine and that there is a causal link between that defect and that disease. National courts must, however, ensure that their specific application of those evidentiary rules does not result in the burden of proof introduced by Article 4 being disregarded or the effectiveness of the system of liability introduced by that directive being undermined.</p>

However, such a presumption would have the consequence that, even where the pre-identified facts are not, hypothetically, capable of establishing with certainty the existence of such a causal link, the producer would, in such a case, be deprived of all opportunity to adduce facts or put forward arguments, such as scientific arguments, in order to rebut that presumption, and the court would thus not have any opportunity to assess the facts in the light of that evidence or those arguments. In being so automatic, such a situation would not only undermine the principle set out in Article 4 of Directive 85/374 by which the victim has the burden of proof of the defect and the causal link, but would also risk compromising the very effectiveness of the system of liability introduced by that directive. The presence of one of the three conditions for engaging the liability of the producer under that directive would then be imposed on the court, without its even having the possibility of examining whether the other facts submitted to it for assessment in the case before it might not lead to the opposite conclusion.</p>

            <p>In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the second question is that Article 4 of Directive 85/374 must be interpreted as precluding evidentiary rules based on presumptions according to which, where medical research neither establishes nor rules out the existence of a link between the administering of the vaccine and the occurrence of the victim's disease, the existence of a causal link between the defect attributed to the vaccine and the damage suffered by the victim will always be considered to be established when certain predetermined causation-related factual evidence is presented.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 4 of Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States concerning liability for defective products must be interpreted as not precluding national evidentiary rules such as those at issue in the main proceedings under which, when a court ruling on the merits of an action involving the liability of the producer of a vaccine due to an alleged defect in that vaccine, in the exercise of its exclusive jurisdiction to appraise the facts, may consider that, notwithstanding the finding that medical research neither establishes nor rules out the existence of a link between the administering of the vaccine and the occurrence of the victim's disease, certain factual evidence relied on by the applicant constitutes serious, specific and consistent evidence enabling it to conclude that there is a defect in the vaccine and that there is a causal link between that defect and that disease. National courts must, however, ensure that their specific application of those evidentiary rules does not result in the burden of proof introduced by Article 4 being disregarded or the effectiveness of the system of liability introduced by that directive being undermined. 2. Article 4 of Directive 85/374 must be interpreted as precluding evidentiary rules based on presumptions according to which, where medical research neither establishes nor rules out the existence of a link between the administering of the vaccine and the occurrence of the victim's disease, the existence of a causal link between the defect attributed to the vaccine and the damage suffered by the victim will always be considered to be established when certain predetermined causation-related factual evidence is presented.</p>
