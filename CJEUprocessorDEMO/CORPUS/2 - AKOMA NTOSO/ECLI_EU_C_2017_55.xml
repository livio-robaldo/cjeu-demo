In respect of on-the-spot checks on commitments other than those relating to the area, point 7.2 specifies that counting of animals should be undertaken. Under the integrated aid management and control system, bovine animals are checked in relation to livestock aid and are not specifically checked in relation to CANH. The ovine animals used for the calculation of the livestock are those declared as such in an application for the ewe premium and filed in the year in which the CANH dossier was submitted. For new applicants, the ovine animals used are checked by counting the animals present on the day of the check.</p>

            <p>Under Article 36(a)(i) and (ii) of Regulation No 1698/2005, the French authorities adopted a Plan for Rural Development in France for the period 2007 to 2013, which provides for, inter alia, the granting of CANH to farmers located in areas of natural handicaps. That programme was approved by Commission Decision C(2007) 3446 final of 19 July 2007. It accordingly states that the payment of compensation for forage areas to farmers located in areas of natural handicaps is subject to compliance by the latter with a stocking criterion. This criterion, expressed as a unit of livestock per hectare ( `LU'), allows the density of livestock on forage areas to be controlled so as to avoid under-grazing or overgrazing. The stock amount is defined at the departmental level and falls between thresholds defined by area or by sub-area.</p>

However, the Commission services found that the stock density was not verified during the on-the-spot checks, which constituted a failure to comply with Article 14(2) of Regulation No 1975/2006.</p>

            <p>The French Republic raised three pleas in support of its action. The first plea alleged infringement of Article 10(2) and (4) and Article 14(2) of Regulation No 1975/2006. The second plea concerned breach of Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1082/2003 of 23 June 2003 laying down detailed rules for the implementation of Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards the minimum level of controls to be carried out in the framework of the system for the identification and registration of bovine animals ( OJ 2003 L 156, p. 9) and Article 26(2)(b) of Regulation No 796/2004. Last, the third plea, alleged, in the alternative, unlawful extension by the Commission of the application of the flat-rate correction to ovine holdings which are not eligible for the ewe premium and to bovine holdings inspected in the context of the identification of bovine animals or beef premiums.</p>

            <p>In paragraphs 59 to 63 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court stated that it was necessary to examine both parts of the first plea together on the ground that they both sought to establish that the Commission had infringed Article 10(2) and (4) and Article 14(2) of Regulation No 1975/2006. To that end, the General Court examined whether those provisions required the French Republic to count animals during on-the-spot checks or whether administrative checks put in place in respect of a database, for whose establishment on-the-spot checks had been carried out, constituted suitable methods and means for verifying the conditions for granting the support.</p>

            <p>In paragraphs 64 to 69 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court considered that it was not expressly stated in Articles 10 and 14 of Regulation No 1975/2006 that Member States were under an obligation to count animals during on-the-spot checks. However, it held that, by virtue of those articles and Article 35 of Regulation No 796/2004, which provide for on-the-spot checks, Member States have a limited margin of discretion as to the suitable methods and means to verify the conditions for granting the support.</p>

            <p>Pursuing that line of reasoning, it stated, in paragraph 70 of that judgment, that nothing in Regulation No 1975/2006 can be interpreted as meaning that, in the event that administrative checks are carried out using information derived from a reliable database, the national authorities may forgo the counting of animals during on-the-spot checks. In its view, such an interpretation disregarded the objective of on-the-spot checks, which included verifying the conformity of the information contained in the databases drawn up by the Member States in accordance with Article 15(3) of Regulation No 1975/2006 and Article 35 of Regulation No 796/2004.</p>

            <p>The General Court accordingly held, at paragraph 71 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had rightly considered that Articles 10 and 14 of Regulation No 1975/2006 required the counting of animals when on-the-spot checks are carried out in accordance with Article 15(3) of Regulation No 1975/2006 and Article 35 of Regulation No 796/2004.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, in paragraphs 73 to 76 of that judgment, the General Court rejected the argument that the existence of on-the-spot checks carried out for the purpose of establishing databases relieved the French authorities of the need to carry out on-the-spot checks under Article 12 et seq. of Regulation No 1975/2006. In its view, the arguments of the French Republic concerning the reliability of the national database were not relevant in that regard. On the one hand, it considered that the administration and control rules provided for in that regulation constituted specific measures in those areas. On the other hand, it considered that the checks carried out for the establishment of that database could not be regarded as on-the-spot checks within the meaning of that regulation, since the aim of those checks was not to assess the particular conditions of the measures in support of rural development, but to verify compliance of all the animals on a holding for which identification of bovine animals is provided for under Regulation (EC) No 1760/2000 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 17 July 2000 establishing a system for the identification and registration of bovine animals and regarding the labelling of beef and beef products and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No 820/97 ( OJ 2000 L 204, p. 1).</p>

            <p>In paragraph 81 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the argument that the Commission's interpretation is contrary to the continuity of the stock density criterion. According to the Commission, although the required number of LUs must be present on a holding throughout the reference year, it does not follow that the on-the-spot checks provided for in Regulation No 1975/2006 should not be carried out. The General Court stated that the purpose of those checks is to verify that the information contained in the databases used to carry out administrative checks is correct and that those databases are accurate. It thus noted, in paragraph 82 of the judgment under appeal, that the counting of animals during on-the-spot checks made it possible to carry out the checks required under Regulation No 1975/2006 and to ensure the conformity of the databases when calculating the stock density, even if this did not make it possible to take account of the parameter relating to the time spent by the animals on a holding or, in a precise manner, the parameter relating to the age of the bovine animals.</p>

It notes that the CANH circular stipulates that the French authorities are to carry out on-the-spot checks and that during the clearance procedure the Commission did not dispute that such checks had been carried out.

            <p>Second, the French Republic submits that, in paragraphs 65 to 71 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court committed several errors of law. First, it distorted the content of the decision at issue by substituting its own reasoning for that of the Commission. Thus, it does not appear from that decision that the Commission considered that the controls put in place by the French authorities were governed by Article 15(3) of Regulation No 1975/2006 and Article 35 of Regulation No 796/2004. Moreover, the General Court erred in interpreting and applying Article 15(3) of Regulation No 1975/2006 and Article 35 of Regulation No 796/2004, by considering that the CANH control system had to comply with the controls provided for in those provisions, which apply to the control of animal-related measures and not to area-related measures. Article 37(1) of Regulation No 1698/2005 and the Annex to that regulation provide that CANHs are area-related measures within the meaning of Article 6(2)(a) of Regulation No 1975/2006.</p>

According to the French Republic, Article 14(2) of Regulation No 1975/2006, on which the decision at issue is based and which the General Court did not examine, provides that on-the-spot checks cover all commitments which can be checked at the time of the visit.

            <p>The French Republic submits that the legality of the decision at issue also depends on the question of whether the French authorities had infringed Article 10(2) of Regulation No 1975/2006, which provides that the Member States are to define suitable methods and means for verifying the conditions for granting support for each support measure. The database used to calculate the stock density provides sufficient guarantees of reliability to allow the conclusion that the use of the data derived from it is a suitable means of verifying the conditions for the granting of CANH. Consequently, the General Court should have taken the view that, within the meaning of Article 10(2), those control arrangements ensured suitable verification of the conditions for the granting of CANH, since the stock density criterion was not, moreover, a commitment which could be checked by counting the animals at the time of the visit.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, it must be noted that the French Republic disputes, in essence, the existence of an obligation to count animals during on-the-spot checks of CANHs. As is clear from paragraphs 27 and 28 above, the General Court considered that such an obligation stems in particular from the application of Article 15(3) of Regulation No 1975/2006 and Article 35 of Regulation No 796/2004, a part of the argument of the French Republic being specifically directed against that ground of the judgment under appeal.</p>

            <p>First, it must be borne in mind that, in paragraphs 59 to 82 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court examined the two parts of the first plea in the action for annulment together in order to determine whether the provisions of Regulation No 1975/2006, and in particular Article 10 et seq. thereof, required the animals to be counted during on-the-spot checks.</p>

            <p>The General Court pointed out in paragraph 64 of the judgment under appeal that `Articles 10 and 14 of Regulation No 1975/2006 do not expressly provide for an obligation to count animals during on-the-spot checks'. However, it found, in paragraphs 65 to 67 of that judgment, that those articles and Article 35 of Regulation No 796/2004 limit the discretion of the Member States as to methods and means of on-the-spot checks on the conditions to be met by the aid beneficiaries and as to the detailed rules for their implementation.</p>

            <p>The General Court held, in paragraph 70 of the judgment under appeal, that nothing in Regulation No 1975/2006 can be interpreted as authorising the national authorities to forgo, in certain cases, the counting of animals during on-the-spot checks. The obligation to count animals arises from the application of the provisions of Article 35 of Regulation No 796/2004 to the CANH checks by virtue of the reference made to that effect by Article 15(3) Regulation No 1975/2006, with the aim, inter alia, of verifying `the conformity of the information contained in the databases after they have been drawn up by the Member State'.</p>

More specifically, Article 14(2) of that regulation requires Member States to carry out on-the-spot checks covering all the commitments and obligations of a beneficiary, including those arising under national law, which can be checked at the time of the visit.</p>

            <p>In the present case, the Plan for Rural Development in France, as approved by the Commission, provided, as a requirement of eligibility for CANH, for a stocking criterion expressed in LU, which sought to control the density of livestock present on forage areas in order to avoid under-grazing and overgrazing. The French authorities were therefore required during the on-the-spot checks to determine the stocking criterion by counting the animals present on the holding at the time of the inspection visit, a count which moreover was provided for in point 7.2 of the CANH circular, in order to verify whether that criterion was adhered to punctually and thus to corroborate the data emerging from the administrative checks.</p>

The same applies to the assertion that, contrary to the finding in paragraph 62 of the judgment under appeal, it did not claim that the completeness of the administrative checks made counting animals on the spot superfluous.</p>

            <p>First, it submits that its argument before the General Court that the on-the-spot checks already carried out in the context of managing that identification or those premiums relieved the French authorities of the obligation to count the animals during the on-the-spot checks is based on Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 of 29 September 2003 establishing common rules for direct support schemes under the common agricultural policy and establishing certain support schemes for farmers and amending Regulations (EEC) No 2019/93, (EC) No 1452/2001, (EC) No 1453/2001, (EC) No 1454/2001, (EC) No 1868/94, (EC) No 1251/1999, (EC) No 1254/1999, (EC) No 1673/2000, (EEC) No 2358/71 and (EC) No 2529/2001 ( OJ 2003 L 270, p. 1) and No 1975/2006. First, the second paragraph of Article 26 of Regulation No 1782/2003 provides that Member States may, for the purposes of applying EU or national support schemes, incorporate in their administration and control procedures one or more components of the integrated administration and control system in order to avoid any duplication of sectoral checks of the same type. Second, it is apparent from Article 5(2) of Regulation No 1975/2006 that, where possible, on-the-spot checks provided for in Articles 12, 20 and 27 of that regulation and other checks provided for in rules regarding agricultural subsidies are to be carried out at the same time.</p>

It therefore contends that the General Court, in holding that on-the-spot checks under Article 12 et seq. of Regulation No 1975/2006 and on-the-spot checks for the purposes of establishing the database could not be carried out at the same time, erred in law.</p>

In its view, those recitals state that specific administration and control rules should be laid down in order to take account of the special characteristics of the support schemes under Axis 2. The content and eligibility criteria of those schemes are to be defined by the Member States. In those circumstances, the Commission could not lay down, in that regulation, specific control measures which the Member States would have to put in place in order to verify that the eligibility conditions for each aid measure defined in Axis 2 was complied with.</p>

Putting in place additional checks is necessary only if the checks already carried out in respect of another aid measure were not sufficient to verify that all the eligibility conditions in respect of the measure falling under Axis 2 were complied with.</p>

In the Court's view, the administration and control rules laid down by Regulation No 1975/2006 constituted specific measures in those areas and the verifications carried out for the establishment of the databases did not constitute such checks, since those checks were intended not `to assess the particular conditions of the measures in support of rural development', but to verify compliance of all the animals on a holding for which identification of bovine animals is provided for under Regulation No 1760/2000.</p>

            <p>Thus, by arguing, at the appeal stage, that the first paragraph of Article 26 of Regulation No 1782/2003 and Article 5(2) of Regulation No 1975/2006 is applicable to the present case, the French Republic indicates the legal bases capable of supporting the argument which it had made at first instance.</p>

            <p>In a dispute between the parties concerning the interpretation and application of provisions of EU law, as is the case here, the EU judicature is required to apply the relevant rules of law for the solution of the dispute, at first instance, to the facts put before it by the parties and, at the appeal stage, to the grounds of the judgment by which the General Court responded to the arguments put before it.</p>

            <p>Since the appeal challenges the assessment made by the General Court in paragraphs 73 to 76 of the judgment under appeal, the argument alleging infringement by the Commission of the first paragraph of Article 26 of Regulation No 1782/2003 and Article 5(2) of Regulation No 1975/2006 cannot be regarded as new and must be examined on the merits.</p>

            <p>It should be noted that, in view of the very general nature of the obligations imposed on the Member States by the first paragraph of Article 26 of Regulation No 1782/2003, that provision is irrelevant for the purpose of determining whether the on-the-spot checks already carried out on the administration of identification of bovine animals or beef premiums relieved the French authorities of the need to count the animals during the on-the-spot checks provided for in Articles 10 and 14 of Regulation No 1975/2006.</p>
