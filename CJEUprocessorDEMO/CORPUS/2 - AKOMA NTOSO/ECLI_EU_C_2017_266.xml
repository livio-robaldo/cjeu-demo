As the action was dismissed by that court by decision of 18 August 2014, which was confirmed on appeal by an order of the Lietuvos apeliacinis teismas (Court of Appeal, Lithuania) of 13 November 2014, Borta brought an appeal on a point of law before the Lietuvos Aukščiausiasis Teismas (Supreme Court, Lithuania).</p>

            <p>In order to decide the dispute before it, that court asks about the compatibility with EU law, and with Directive 2004/17 in particular, of Article 24(5) of the Law on public procurement, to which Clause 4.3 of the tender specifications at issue in the main proceedings refers, in so far as that article prohibits reliance on subcontracting activities for works defined by the contracting authority as `main works'. In the light of that directive, it also expresses doubts as to the legality of Clause 4.3, as amended, where a common tender is submitted by a number of tenderers, as that clause requires, in order to satisfy the applicable requirements regarding professional capacities, that the contribution of each tenderer must correspond proportionally to the share of the works it will actually perform if the contract is awarded. In that context, the referring court also asks whether the port authority was able to change the first version of that clause after the publication of the contract notice without infringing that directive and, in particular, the principle of equal treatment and the obligation of transparency which derives from it.</p>

            <p>That court considers that the Court of Justice has jurisdiction to give a preliminary ruling on those questions. It is true that the value of the contract at issue in the main proceedings is less than the threshold of EUR 5186000 laid down in Article 16(b) of Directive 2004/17, below which the latter is not applicable. However, first, that contract has a certain cross border interest, as evidenced by the participation in the award procedure of two foreign companies, which include the successful tenderer, and the publication of the call for tenders in the Official Journal of the European Union. Second, in any event, the port authority intended to make the call for tenders subject to the rules applicable to public procurement referred to in Directive 2004/17, and the Lithuanian legislature chose to extend certain rules laid down by that directive to contracts with a value less than the abovementioned threshold.</p>

            <p>In its written observations and at the hearing, the Lithuanian Government submitted that, in order to answer the questions referred, it is appropriate to take into account Directive 2004/17 and Directive 2014/25/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on procurement by entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors and repealing Directive 2004/17/EC ( OJ 2014 L 94, p. 243), as the Lithuanian legislature chose to include certain provisions of Directive 2014/25 into its domestic law even before its adoption, in particular Article 79(3) thereof relating to subcontracting activities.</p>

            <p>The European Commission takes the opposite view, arguing that there is no need to interpret Directive 2004/17 or Directive 2014/25, but that it is appropriate to answer the questions referred in the light of the fundamental rules and general principles of the FEU Treaty.</p>

            <p>First, as regards Directive 2014/25, it must be recalled, as a preliminary point, that according to settled case-law the applicable directive is, as a rule, the one in force when the contracting authority chooses the type of procedure to be followed and decides definitively whether it is necessary for a prior call for competition to be issued for the award of a public contract. Conversely, a directive is not applicable if the period prescribed for its transposition expired after that point in time (see, to that effect, judgment of 7 April 2016, Partner Apelski Dariusz, C‑324/14, EU:C:2016:214, paragraph 83 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the present case, the call for tenders at issue in the main proceedings was published on 2 April 2014, whereas Directive 2014/25 entered into force on 17 April 2014 and repealed Directive 2004/17 with effect from 18 April 2016, the date on which its period for transposition expired. Furthermore, although the Lithuanian Government claims to have incorporated into its national law certain provisions of Directive 2014/25 even before its adoption, that government also acknowledges in its written submissions that that directive had not yet been transposed at the material time.</p>

            <p>Second, as regards Directive 2004/17, it is apparent from the decision to refer that the contract at issue in the main proceedings has a value which is less than the threshold of EUR 5186000 laid down in Article 16(b) of Directive 2004/17. Therefore, that directive is not applicable to the contract (see, by analogy, judgment of 16 April 2015, Enterprise Focused Solutions, C‑278/14, EU:C:2015:228, paragraph 15 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_4999__content">
            <p>At the hearing, the Lithuanian Government, which shares the referring court's view, stated that under Lithuanian law the contracting entity can choose to make the award procedure for a contract with a value below the threshold mentioned above subject either to the rules laid down by Directive 2004/17 or to the simplified procedure laid down by national law for that type of contract. If, as in the present case, that entity chooses the first option, it is required, according to the Lithuanian Government, to apply all the provisions of that directive.</p>

          <content eId="para_5000__content">
            <p>In that connection, it must be recalled that where, in regulating situations outside the scope of the EU measure concerned, national legislation seeks to adopt the same solutions as those adopted in that measure, it is clearly in the interest of the European Union that, in order to forestall future differences of interpretation, provisions taken from that measure should be interpreted uniformly (see, to that effect, judgments of 18 October 2012, Nolan, C‑583/10, EU:C:2012:638, paragraph 46, and of 7 November 2013, Romeo, C‑313/12, EU:C:2013:718, paragraph 22).</p>

          <content eId="para_5001__content">
            <p>Thus, an interpretation by the Court of provisions of EU law in situations outside its scope is justified where those provisions have been made applicable to such situations by national law in a direct and unconditional way in order to ensure that internal situations and situations governed by EU law are treated in the same way (see, to that effect, judgments of 18 October 2012, Nolan, C‑583/10, EU:C:2012:638, paragraph 47; of 7 November 2013, Romeo, C‑313/12, EU:C:2013:718, paragraphs 22 and 23; and of 14 January 2016, Ostas celtnieks, C‑234/14, EU:C:2016:6, paragraph 20).</p>

            <p>That being the case, it is also clear from settled case-law that, where the conditions set out in the two preceding paragraphs of the present judgment are not met, in order to provide a useful answer to a national court which has referred a question to it, the Court may deem it necessary to consider rules of EU law to which the national court has not referred in its request for a preliminary ruling (judgment of 16 April 2015, Enterprise Focused Solutions, C‑278/14, EU:C:2015:228, paragraph 17 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>More particularly, with respect to the award of a contract which, having regard to its value, does not come within the scope of Directive 2004/17, the Court may take account of the fundamental rules and general principles of the FEU Treaty, in particular Articles 49 and 56 thereof and the principles of equal treatment and non-discrimination and the obligation of transparency which derive from them, provided that it is of certain cross-border interest. Although not covered by Directive 2004/17, such contracts are still subject to compliance with those rules and principles (see, to that effect, judgments of 23 December 2009, Serrantoni and Consorzio stabile edili, C‑376/08, EU:C:2009:808, paragraphs 22 to 24; of 18 December 2014, Gennerali-Providencia Biztositó, C‑470/13, EU:C:2014:2469, paragraph 27; and of 6 October 2016, Tecnoedi Costruzioni, C‑318/15, EU:C:2016:747, paragraph 19).</p>

            <p>It is in the light of the foregoing that each of the questions referred must be examined to determine whether the interpretation of the provisions of Directive 2004/17 is justified in the present case, having regard to the considerations set out in paragraphs 33 and 34 of the present judgment, or whether those questions must be answered in the light of the fundamental rules and general principles in the FEU Treaty mentioned above, taking account of the considerations in paragraphs 35 and 36 of this judgment.</p>

              <p>Question 1(a)</p>
            </tblock>
            <p>38 By Question 1(a), the referring court asks essentially whether Directive 2004/17 must be interpreted as precluding a provision of a national law, such as Article 24(5) of the Law on public procurement, which states that where subcontractors are invited to carry out a works contract, the main works, as defined by the contracting entity, must be performed by the successful tenderer itself.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, it must be held that, as regards reliance on subcontracting activities, Directive 2004/17 merely lays down, in Article 37 and Annex XVI thereof, certain obligations relating to information and the liability of the tenderer. In Article 38, it adds that the contracting entities may lay down special conditions relating to the performance of a contract, provided that these are compatible with EU law.</p>

            <p>However, as the referring court observed, that directive does not contain any provision having contents analogous to those in Article 24(5) of the Law on public procurement.

            <p>A contract may have such interest, having regard in particular to the fact that is for a significant amount, in conjunction with the place where the work is to be carried out or the technical characteristics of the contract. The referring court may, in its overall assessment of the existence of certain cross-border interest, also take account of the existence of complaints brought by operators situated in other Member States, provided that it is determined that those complaints are real and not fictitious (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 April 2015, Enterprise Focused Solutions, C‑278/14, EU:C:2015:228, paragraph 20 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the present case, the referring court has established that the contract at issue in the main proceedings had a certain cross-border interest. As the Advocate General observed, in point 37 of her Opinion, the value of that contract, although below the thresholds laid down in Article 16(b) of Directive 2004/17, is relatively significant. Furthermore, as the Lithuanian Government stated, that contract concerns the construction of quays of a seaport of strategic importance for national security. It is also apparent from the order for reference that two foreign undertakings, including the successful tenderer, participated in the call for tenders.</p>

            <p>As regards public contracts, it is the concern of the European Union to ensure the widest possible participation by tenderers in a call for tenders, including contracts which are not covered by Directive 2004/17 (see, to that effect, judgments of 10 July 2014, Consorzio Stabile Libor Lavori Pubblici, C‑358/12, EU:C:2014:2063, paragraph 29, and of 28 January 2016, CASTA and Others, C‑50/14, EU:C:2016:56, paragraph 55).

            <p>In the case in the main proceedings, it is clear from the documents before the Court, first, that Article 24(5) of the Law on public procurement aims to ensure that the works are properly executed. Thus, it was adopted specifically with the aim of preventing a current practice which consists in a tenderer claiming to have professional capacities solely in order to win the contract concerned, not with the intention of performing the works itself, but of entrusting all or most of those works to subcontractors, a practice which affects the quality of the works and their proper performance. Second, by limiting the reliance on subcontractors to works identified as `subsidiary', Article 24(5) of the Law on public procurement aims to encourage the participation of small and medium-sized undertakings in public contracts as joint-tenderers in a group of economic operators rather than as subcontractors.</p>

However, it must still stipulate, with respect to all contracts, that those works are to be carried out by the tenderer itself. Thus, Article 24(5) of the Law on public procurement prohibits reliance on subcontractors for those works, including in situations in which the contracting entity is able to verify the capacities of the subcontractors concerned and to take the view, after that verification, that such a prohibition is unnecessary for the proper execution of the works having regard, in particular, to the nature of the tasks that the tenderer plans to delegate to those subcontractors.</p>

            <p>Moreover, in so far as the referring court and the Lithuanian Government submit that Article 24(5) of the Law on public procurement was adopted in order to prevent a current practice by which tenderers claim to have professional capacities solely in order to win the contract concerned with the intention of entrusting the largest part or most of the works to subcontractors, it must be observed that that provision does not specifically target that practice. Thus, it prohibits the tenderer from delegating the performance of all the works identified as the `main' works by the contracting entity, including the tasks which represent, proportionally, only a small part of those works. Therefore, that provision goes beyond what is necessary to prevent the abovementioned practice.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, the port authority stated essentially at the hearing that Clause 4.3 of the tender specifications at issue in the main proceedings had to be read together with Clause 4.2.3 thereof. According to the latter clause, tenderers wishing to submit a common tender must indicate in a joint-association agreement the share of works that each of them undertakes to perform, it being stated that that division is freely determined by those tenderers. Clause 4.3 enables the contracting authority to verify when examining the tenders that each of the tenders concerned has professional capacities corresponding proportionally to the share of the works it undertakes to perform in accordance with that contract, and that it will actually execute if the contract is awarded.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the answer to Question 1(b) is that Article 54(6) of Directive 2004/17 must be interpreted as precluding a clause in tender specifications, such as Clause 4.3 at issue in the main proceedings, which, in a case where a common tender is submitted by several tenderers, requires that the contribution of each of them in order to satisfy the requirements applicable with regard to professional capacities correspond, proportionally, to the share of the works that it will actually perform if that bid is successful.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fifth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. As regards a public contract which is not covered by the scope of Directive 2004/17/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 coordinating the procurement procedures of entities operating in the water, energy, transport and postal services sectors, as amended by Commission Regulation (EU) No 1336/2013 of 13 December 2013, but which has a certain cross-border interest, Articles 49 and 56 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a provision of national law, such as Article 24(5) of the Lietuvos Respublikos viešųjų pirkimų įstatymas (Law on public procurement), which provides that, where subcontractors are relied on for the performance of a public works contract, the tenderer is required to perform itself the main works, as defined by the contracting entity. 2. As regards such a public contract, the principles of equal treatment and non-discrimination and the obligation of transparency which derive from Articles 49 and 56 TFEU must be interpreted as meaning that they do not preclude the contracting entity from making changes to a clause in the tender specifications, after publication of the tender notice, relating to the conditions and scheme for combining professional capacities, such as Clause 4.3 at issue in the main proceedings, provided, first, that the changes made are not so substantial that they have attracted potential tenderers which, in the absence of such changes, would not be in a position to submit a tender, second, they are adequately publicised and, third, they are made before the tenderers submit their bids, that the time limit for submitting those tenders is extended when the changes concerned are substantial, the length of that extension depending on the extent of those changes, and that the length of time is sufficient to allow the economic operators concerned to adapt their tender as a consequence, which is for the referring court to ascertain. 3. Article 54(6) of Directive 2004/17, as amended by Regulation No 1336/2013, must be interpreted as precluding a clause in tender specifications, such as Clause 4.3 at issue in the main proceedings, which, in a case where a common tender is submitted by several tenderers, requires that the contribution of each of them in order to satisfy the requirements applicable with regard to professional capacities correspond, proportionally, to the share of the works that it will actually perform if that bid is successful.</p>
