            <p>In paragraphs 24 to 28 of the [decisions at issue], the Board of Appeal observed, first, that, at the time the applications for registration were filed, the signs were simply classified as ``figurative '', and no description was provided. Following the objections raised by the examiner, the applicant stated that the sign was a two-dimensional representation of the ``shape of a product '', namely, the handle of a knife (Case R 1235/2008-1), or that it represented the ``design of knife handles '' (Case R 1237/2008-1). In correspondence subsequent to the application for a declaration of invalidity filed by [Pi-Design and Others], the sign was, however, described by the applicant as ``an arbitrary geometrical figure '' or a ``pattern of dots '' (Case R 1235/2008-1).</p>

            <p>According to the Board of Appeal, that latter description was made with the specific aim of avoiding the application of Article 7(1)(e)(ii) of Regulation No [40/94], the photographs of the knives marketed by the proprietor confirming that the frame surrounding the black dots represented the contour of a knife handle and that those dots represented dents.</p>

            <p>The Board of Appeal stated in that context, in paragraph 29 of the [decisions at issue], that ``a trade mark must be examined in accordance with the circumstances of the case.

            <p>Next, in paragraphs 30 and 31 of the [decisions at issue], the Board of Appeal stated that ``the sign is a figurative mark consisting of the two-dimensional representation of the handle of the products for which registration is sought ''. Nevertheless, according to the Board of Appeal, the classification of a mark as figurative did not always rule out the application of Article 7(1)(e)(ii) of Regulation No [40/94].</p>

            <p>Last, in paragraphs 33 to 41 of the [decisions at issue], the Board of Appeal considered whether the black dots representing dents performed a technical function. Based on the information relating to existing patents, it concluded that the dents were necessary to obtain a non-skid effect and that the fact that the same result could be obtained by other shapes did not preclude the applicability of the ground for refusal in question from applying.</p>

That plea was broken down into three parts, the first alleging that the scope of that provision had been misinterpreted; the second, that the subject matter of the trade marks at issue had been incorrectly assessed; and the third, that the ground for refusal in question had been misapplied.</p>

            <p>By its first ground of appeal, which is its principal claim, Yoshida criticises the General Court for having contravened Article 7(1)(e)(ii) of Regulation No 40/94, first, in holding, in paragraph 39 of the judgment under appeal, that that provision `applies to any sign, whether two- or three-dimensional, where all the essential characteristics of the sign perform a technical function'.</p>

            <p>In that regard, Yoshida argues that the General Court adopted an approach contrary to the case-law of the Court of Justice (judgment of 14 September 2010, Lego Juris v OHIM, C‑48/09 P, EU:C:2010:516, paragraphs 48, 52 and 72), according to which</p>

                <p>the words `exclusively' and `necessary' used in that provision serve to restrict the scope of application of Article 7(1)(e)(ii) more narrowly to signs which are solely shapes of goods which only incorporate a technical solution.</p>

            <p>Second, Yoshida argues that the General Court was wrong to consider, in paragraphs 64 and 65 of the judgment under appeal, that, for it to be possible to register the signs at issue, the array of black dots had to be `a major non-functional element' of those signs and those signs had to have a `clear ornamental character'. According to Yoshida, Article 7(1)(e)(ii) of Regulation No 40/94 does not prevent the registration of `hybrid' signs comprising visually significant decorative design elements which do not only incorporate a technical solution but which also perform a distinguishing function. Such is the case with the signs at issue.</p>

            <p>In the first place, in so far as Yoshida argues that the signs at issue constitute `hybrid signs', it seeks to call into question the factual findings made by the General Court following the examination of the relevant evidence, in particular in paragraphs 46 to 50 and 63 to 65 of the judgment under appeal, relating to the essential characteristics of the signs at issue.</p>

            <p>However, under Article 256(1) TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, an appeal is limited to points of law. The General Court has exclusive jurisdiction to find and appraise the relevant facts and to assess the evidence. The appraisal of those facts and the assessment of that evidence thus do not, save where the facts or evidence have been distorted, constitute a point of law which is subject, as such, to review by the Court of Justice on appeal (judgment of 26 October 2016, Westermann Lernspielverlage v EUIPO, C‑482/15 P, EU:C:2016:805, paragraph 35).</p>

            <p>In that regard, given the exceptional nature of a complaint of distortion, both the provisions referred to and Article 168(1)(d) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice require, in particular, that an appellant indicate precisely the elements alleged to have been distorted by the General Court and show the errors of appraisal which, in its view, led to that distortion. Such a distortion must be obvious from the documents in the file, without there being any need to carry out a new assessment of the facts and the evidence (see, to that effect, judgment of 20 October 2011, PepsiCo v Grupo Promer Mon Graphic, C‑281/10 P, EU:C:2011:679, paragraphs 78 and 79).</p>

            <p>In the present case, Yoshida, which limits itself, in essence, to stating that the signs at issue contain significant decorative and distinctive elements, does not support its argument with elements from the file that are capable of clearly establishing that the General Court distorted the facts and evidence in not reaching the conclusion that the specific configuration of the array of black dots had a sufficiently significant ornamental character for them to be considered an essential non-functional element of the signs at issue.</p>

            <p>In the second place, to the extent that Yoshida argues that it is apparent from paragraphs 39, 64 and 65 of the judgment under appeal that the assessment made by the General Court for the purposes of the application of Article 7(1)(e)(ii) of Regulation No 40/94 is contrary to the case-law arising from the judgment of the Court of Justice of 14 September 2010, Lego Juris v OHIM ( C‑48/09 P, EU:C:2010:516), its criticisms stem from a selective reading of that judgment.</p>

            <p>It follows from that judgment that, by restricting the ground for refusal set out in Article 7(1)(e)(ii) of Regulation No 40/94 to signs which consist `exclusively' of the shape of goods which is `necessary' to obtain a technical result, the legislature duly took into account that any shape of goods is, to a certain extent, functional and that it would therefore be inappropriate to refuse to register a shape of goods as a trade mark solely on the ground that it has functional characteristics. By the terms `exclusively' and `necessary', that provision ensures that solely shapes of goods which only incorporate a technical solution, and whose registration as a trade mark would therefore actually impede the use of that technical solution by other undertakings, are not to be registered. Such a registration would unduly impair the opportunity for competitors to place on the market goods whose shapes incorporate the same technical solution (judgment of 14 September 2010, Lego Juris v OHIM, C‑48/09 P, EU:C:2010:516, paragraphs 48 and 59).</p>

            <p>As regards the condition relating to the fact that the ground for refusal covers any sign consisting `exclusively' of the shape of goods which is necessary to obtain a technical result, the Court has held that the presence of one or more minor arbitrary elements in a sign, all of whose essential characteristics are dictated by the technical solution to which that sign gives effect, does not alter the conclusion that the sign consists exclusively of the shape of goods which is necessary to obtain a technical result. In addition, the ground for refusal under Article 7(1)(e)(ii) of Regulation No 40/94 is applicable only where all the essential characteristics of the sign are functional, with the result that such a sign cannot be refused registration as a trade mark under that provision if the shape of the goods at issue incorporates a major non-functional element, such as a decorative or imaginative element which plays an important role in the shape (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 September 2010, Lego Juris v OHIM, C‑48/09 P, EU:C:2010:516, paragraph 52).</p>

            <p>The Court has also held that the correct application of Article 7(1)(e)(ii) of Regulation No 40/94 requires that the essential characteristics of the sign at issue -- that is, the most important elements of the sign -- be properly identified by the authority deciding on the application for registration of the sign as a trade mark. Once the sign's essential characteristics have been identified, the competent authority has to ascertain whether they all perform the technical function of the goods at issue (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 September 2010, Lego Juris v OHIM, C‑48/09 P, EU:C:2010:516, paragraphs 68, 69 and 72).</p>

            <p>Contrary to what Yoshida claims, it follows from those considerations that the fact that the sign concerned has ornamental and fanciful aspects does not preclude the ground for refusal under Article 7(1)(e)(ii) of Regulation No 40/94 from applying, in so far as those aspects do not play an important role in the shape of goods at issue, all the essential characteristics of which must perform a technical function.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, the General Court was right to conclude, in paragraph 39 of the judgment under appeal, that Article 7(1)(e)(ii) of Regulation No 40/94 applies where all the essential characteristics of the sign perform a technical function. Similarly, the General Court's assessment, in paragraphs 64 and 65 of the judgment under appeal -- essentially intended to ascertain whether the specific configuration of the array of block dots constituted a major non-functional element of the signs at issue -- correctly reflects the position of the Court of Justice recalled in paragraphs 26 to 28 of the present judgment.</p>

            <p>In the third place, in so far as Yoshida maintains that the distinctiveness of the signs at issue precludes the application of Article 7(1)(e)(ii) of Regulation No 40/94, it wrongly confuses the specific ground for refusal of registration set out in that provision and the ground provided for in Article 7(1)(b) of that regulation, according to which trade marks which are devoid of any distinctive character are not to be registered.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be noted that the inclusion in Article 7(1) of Regulation No 40/94 of the prohibition of registration as a trade mark of any sign consisting of the shape of goods which is necessary to obtain a technical result ensures that undertakings may not use trade mark law in order to perpetuate, indefinitely, exclusive rights relating to technical solutions (judgment of 14 September 2010, Lego Juris v OHIM, C‑48/09 P, EU:C:2010:516, paragraph 45).</p>

          <content eId="para_7356__content">
            <p>Moreover, the legislature has laid down with particular strictness that shapes necessary to obtain a technical result are unsuitable for registration as trade marks, since it has excluded the grounds for refusal listed in Article 7(1)(e) of Regulation No 40/94 from the scope of the exception under Article 7(3) of that regulation. It thus follows from Article 7(3) of the regulation that, even if a shape of goods which is necessary to obtain a technical result has become distinctive in consequence of the use which has been made of it, it is prohibited from being registered as a trade mark (judgment of 14 September 2010, Lego Juris v OHIM, C‑48/09 P, EU:C:2010:516, paragraph 47).</p>

            <p>Consequently, Article 7(1)(e)(ii) of Regulation No 40/94 constitutes an obstacle that may prevent a sign consisting exclusively of the shape of goods which is necessary to obtain a technical result from being registered as a trade mark, even though that sign is capable of performing the essential function of a trade mark, that of guaranteeing the identity of the origin of the goods or services in question to the consumer by enabling him, without any possibility of confusion, to distinguish those goods or services from others which have another origin (see, to that effect, judgments of 15 September 2005, BioID v OHIM, C‑37/03 P, EU:C:2005:547, paragraph 60, and of 16 September 2015, Société des Produits Nestlé, C‑215/14, EU:C:2015:604, paragraph 38).</p>

According to Yoshida, so far as those goods are concerned, Article 7(1)(e)(ii) of Regulation No 40/94 is not applicable, as the signs at issue constitute two-dimensional marks that may be used as logos.</p>

Since EUIPO and Pi-Design and Others have applied for costs to be awarded against Yoshida and Yoshida has been unsuccessful, it must be ordered to pay the costs of the appeal proceedings. On those grounds, the Court (Fifth Chamber) hereby: 1. Dismisses the appeal; 2. Orders Yoshida Metal Industry Co. Ltd to pay the costs.</p>
