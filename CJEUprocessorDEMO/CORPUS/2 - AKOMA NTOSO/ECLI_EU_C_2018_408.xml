It considered that Article 4(2) of the Hague Protocol on the application of the law of the forum covered only the rights arising as of the date of installation at the new place of habitual residence.</p>

            <p>Before the referring court, KP submits that, according to Article 3(1) of the Hague Protocol, the German law on maintenance obligations applies to his maintenance claim but does not enable him to obtain maintenance retroactively as the conditions provided for in Paragraph 1613 BGB are not met. It would be appropriate, therefore, according to KP, in accordance with Article 4(2) of the Hague Protocol, to apply Austrian law, which allows the retroactive recovery of maintenance claims.</p>

          <content eId="para_13328__content">
            <p>LO for his part contends that Article 4(2) of the 2007 Hague Protocol does not apply where individual sums claimed by way of maintenance are subject to prescription or are time-barred. In addition, that provision could apply only if the proceedings had been initiated by the maintenance debtor or if the court seised was that of a State in which none of the parties concerned has his residence. In the present case, KP has seized a court in the State of his current habitual residence. Lastly, LO considers that that provision cannot be applied to obtain the payment of maintenance retroactively where the maintenance claim is made after the removal of the maintenance creditor.</p>

          <content eId="para_13329__content">
            <p>The referring court observes that, pursuant to Article 3(2) of the Hague Protocol, following a change of the habitual residence of the creditor, the law of the State of that creditor's new habitual residence applies as of that change and therefore exclusively in relation to the future.</p>

            <p>Therefore, according to that court, it is necessary in the present case to apply German law in respect of the period preceding that change, unless that law is to be disregarded under Article 4(2) of the Hague Protocol. However, the application of that provision in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings is uncertain. That court refers, in this connection, to paragraph 63 of the Explanatory Report of Mr Bonomi on the Hague Protocol (text adopted by the Twenty-First Session of the Hague Conference on Private International Law) ( `the Bonomi Report'), according to which the subsidiary connection to the law of the forum is only of use if the maintenance proceedings are instituted in a State other than that of the creditor's habitual residence, since otherwise the law of the creditor's habitual residence and the law of the forum coincide. The referring court adds that, according to that report, the subsidiary application of the law of the forum under Article 4(2) can be envisaged only if the proceedings are initiated by the debtor, for instance before the competent authority of the State of his own habitual residence or if the authority seised is that of a State in which none of the parties concerned is resident.</p>

            <p>The referring court asks, furthermore, in view of the fact that in the present case KP has not put LO on notice, whether Article 4(2) of the Hague Protocol applies to those cases in which, under the applicable law according to Article 3 of the Protocol, a maintenance claim exists but is refused in relation to the past because the creditor does not meet certain legal conditions.</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is apparent from the order for reference that KP has moved to Austria and that that Member State is the State of his habitual residence. Austrian law is therefore the law applicable under Article 3(1) of the Hague Protocol. However, in accordance with Article 3(2) of that Protocol, Austrian law applies only from the point at which KP's residence was changed to Austria, that is to say, from 28 May 2015 in the present case. In respect of the previous period, from 1 June 2013 to 28 May 2015, the law of the State of KP's habitual residence is German law.</p>

The fact that the creditor has seized a court in the State of his habitual residence, with the result that the State of the forum corresponds to the State of his habitual residence, does not preclude the application of that provision as long as the law designated by the ancillary connecting rule in that provision does not coincide with the law designated by the main connecting rule in Article 3 of that Protocol.</p>

The German Government, for its part, considers that, with regard to maintenance claims relating to periods in the past, the law of the forum does not apply automatically and that there must be a connection between the factual situation giving rise to the debt claimed by the creditor and the law applicable for the purposes of assessing that claim.</p>

The applicability in principle of the law of the State of the creditor's habitual residence laid down in Article 3(1) of the Hague Protocol is limited by the second paragraph of that Article to the period covered by that residence. If Article 4(2) of the Protocol were to be interpreted to the effect that it allows the law of the forum, that is to say, in a case such as that in the main proceedings, the law of the State of the creditor's new habitual residence, always to be applicable to the period prior to the fixing of residence in that State, providing the condition laid down in that provision is met, that interpretation would be tantamount to rendering redundant the general rule set out in Article 3(2) regarding the scope ratione temporis of the law of the State of the creditor's habitual residence.</p>

            <p>In this respect, Article 3(1) of the Hague Protocol primarily provides for the application of the law of the State of the creditor's habitual residence, which is the most closely connected with the creditor's situation and appears therefore to be that which is the best adapted to govern the specific problems which the maintenance creditor may encounter.</p>

            <p>As regards the special rules set out in Article 4(2) to 4(4) of the Hague Protocol, which provide a range of primary and secondary connecting rules applicable in ``cascade '' and intended to counter the risk that the creditor is not able to obtain maintenance under the laws successively designated, Article 4(3) of the Hague Protocol designates first of all the law of the forum in cases where the creditor has seized the competent authority of the State in which the debtor has his habitual residence. As is apparent from point 59 of the Advocate General's Opinion, that State has a connection with the family situation of the creditor and the debtor, at least in so far as the possibilities of the satisfaction of the creditor's needs by the debtor are concerned. The predictability of that law is also attributable to the fact that it is dependent on the jurisdiction of the court chosen, which in the present case coincides with the jurisdiction under the traditional rule that the claimant must bring his action before the court of the defendant.</p>

            <p>In that regard, as is apparent from points 78 and 79 of the Advocate General's Opinion, that connection may result from the jurisdiction which the court seised would have had to deal with maintenance disputes in relation to the period concerned, in accordance with the applicable provisions of Regulation No 4/2009.</p>

            <p>That analysis is justified by the close links between the Hague Protocol and Regulation No 4/2009. Indeed, Article 15 of the Regulation expressly refers to the Hague Protocol and designation of the courts with jurisdiction in accordance with that Regulation indirectly allows designation of the law of the forum. In addition, as the Advocate General has stated in point 56 of his Opinion, that regulation is based on the premiss that there is a connection between the maintenance to which a given dispute relates and the State whose courts have jurisdiction to adjudicate on the dispute.</p>

            <p>It should be noted, at the outset, that such a question arises if the referring court were to find, in the light of the answer given to the first question, that the Austrian courts had jurisdiction under Regulation No 4/2009 to rule on a maintenance claim concerning KP in respect of the period from 1 June 2013 to 28 May 2015. In such a situation, the law of the forum, Austrian law in the present case, could apply if the maintenance creditor were to be `unable ... to obtain maintenance' under the law of the State of his habitual residence during a period in the past such as that at issue in the main proceedings, that being German law in the present case.

That report cites, by way of example, the case in which the law of the State of the creditor's habitual residence provides that the parents' obligation towards children ceases when they reach the age of 18 years, whereas the creditor has reached that age.</p>
