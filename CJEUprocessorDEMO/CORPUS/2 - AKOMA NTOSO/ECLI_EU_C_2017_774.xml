Indeed, it was intended that the Leenheerenpolder, which, at the time, was composed of agricultural land and did not host any of the natural habitat types and species protected elsewhere on the SCI, would be the subject of a so-called `depolderisation' action consisting in its conversion into a natural area under tidal influence to develop its potential.</p>

            <p>By decision of 4 July 2013, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, on the basis of Article 10a of the Nature Conservation Law of 1998, designated the Haringvliet site as an SAC, but excluded the Leenheerenpolder from that area. By judgment of 1 October 2014, the Raad van State (Council of State, Netherlands) annulled that decision, in so far as the Leenheerenpolder did not form part of that SAC. The court held that, since the Leenheerenpolder was included within the limits of the Haringvliet SIC as adopted by the Commission since Commission Decision 2004/813, the Kingdom of the Netherlands was required, in accordance with Article 4(4) of the Habitats Directive, to incorporate that polder in the SAC.</p>

            <p>By letter of 30 September 2014, the Secretary of State notified the Commission that the Leenheerenpolder had no ecological assets and that the initial plans for the reconversion of that polder had been abandoned on the ground that the restoration of the wetlands of Beningerwaard, of Tiengemeten and of polders smaller than the Haringvliet SIC were sufficient to achieve the conservation objectives of the SCI. The Secretary of State added, in that letter, that the decision to abandon the `depolderisation' plans was due to political, social and budgetary considerations.</p>

            <p>By letter of 24 October 2014, the Commission services replied that they accepted the proposal to change the Haringvliet SCI, given, on the one hand, the Netherlands authorities' favourable assessment of the restoration potential present elsewhere on that site and, on the other hand, the fact that a certain number of restoration measures had already been put in place or was planned elsewhere. In that letter, the Commission took the view that the initial proposal to incorporate the Leenheerenpolder into the Haringvliet SCI constituted a `scientific error'.</p>

            <p>In order to answer the question referred to the Court, it is therefore appropriate to examine whether the Habitats Directive authorises the Commission, acting on a proposal from the Member State concerned, to reduce the size of an SCI where the site's initial entry in the list of SCIs was marred by a scientific error, and, as the case may be, whether the reduction at issue in the main proceedings was legitimately warranted by that error.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be noted that to produce a draft list of SCIs, capable of leading to the creation of a coherent European ecological network of SACs, the Commission must have available an exhaustive list of the sites which, at national level, have an ecological interest which is relevant from the point of view of the Habitats Directive's objective of conservation of natural habitats and wild fauna and flora (judgement of 7 November 2000, First Corporate Shipping, C‑371/98, EU:C:2000:600, paragraph 22).</p>

            <p>Only in that way is it possible to realise the objective, in the first subparagraph of Article 3(1) of the Habitats Directive, of maintaining or restoring the natural habitat types and the species' habitats concerned at a favourable conservation status in their natural range, which may lie across one or more frontiers inside the European Union. It follows from Article 1(e) and (i) of the directive, read in conjunction with Article 2(1) of the directive, that the favourable conservation status of a natural habitat or a species must be assessed in relation to the entire European territory of the Member States to which the Treaty applies (judgment of 7 November 2000, First Corporate Shipping, C‑371/98, EU:C:2000:600, paragraph 23).</p>

            <p>However, as set out in Article 4(1) of the Habitats Directive, a site is proposed by the Member State concerned on the basis of the criteria set out in Annex III to the directive and relevant scientific information. In the light of the case-law referred to in paragraph 29 above, it follows that the fact that, on the basis of evidence of a scientific nature, an error that vitiated the relevant scientific information is made apparent may warrant, where appropriate, a reduction in the size of an SCI.</p>

            <p>That interpretation is supported by the Court's case-law stipulating that resources should not be used in vain to manage a site that proves to be of no use to the conservation of natural habitats and species (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 April 2014, Cascina Tre Pini, C‑301/12, EU:C:2014:214, paragraph 28).</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is apparent from the file before the Court that the Netherlands authorities justified their request to the Commission to have the Leenheerenpolder removed from the Haringvliet SCI on the ground that it was decided in 2011 to reassess the domestic policy on nature, and not on the ground that an error had been made at the time the proposal referred to in the first subparagraph of Article 4(1) of the Habitats Directive was made with regard to the ecological value of that polder and its capacity to contribute to the achievement of the objectives of that directive, as set out in Articles 2 and 3 thereof. In particular, the Netherlands authorities did not at any time claim that the potential of that polder with regard to the restoration of the natural habitat types and species concerned, by converting that agricultural area into a natural area under tidal influence, had disappeared. Moreover, in a letter addressed to the Commission on 30 September 2014, the Netherlands authorities stated that the plans to develop ecological assets in that polder had been abandoned for political, social and budgetary reasons, given that the developments that had already partially occurred elsewhere on the Haringvliet site were sufficient to achieve the objectives of that site.</p>
