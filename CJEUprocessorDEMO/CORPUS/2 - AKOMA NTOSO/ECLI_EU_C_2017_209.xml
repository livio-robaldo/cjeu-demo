            <p>On 24 September 2012 the applicant in the main proceedings appealed against that judgment to the Raad van State (Council of State, Belgium). When the auditeur proposed that the appeal should be declared inadmissible on the ground of lack of admissible pleas in law, the applicant in the main proceedings made no request within the time limit for the proceedings to be continued in order for him to be heard. Consequently, on 4 April 2013 the Raad van State (Council of State) found, on the basis of the seventh paragraph of Article 21 of the Coordinated Laws on the Council of State, that there was a presumption that the applicant in the main proceedings had discontinued the action.</p>

By judgment of 2 March 2012, that court dismissed the application.

By judgment of 19 June 2012, the Hof van Cassatie (Court of Cassation) dismissed the appeal, stating that it was not obliged to initiate proceedings before the Court for a preliminary ruling, as the pleas in law put forward by the applicant in the main proceedings were not admissible, for a reason specific to the procedure before the Hof van Cassatie (Court of Cassation).</p>

The successive decisions made by that court, which have all become final, were not the subject of any procedure for erasure, so that he could not have suffered any damage because of them. There cannot therefore be any basis for liability of the Belgian State as a result of that court's exercise of its judicial function.</p>

            <p>The referring court observes, however, that the appeal against that judgment to the Raad van State (Council of State) was not examined as to its substance or even its admissibility, since, as no request for the proceedings to be continued had been made within the statutory period following service of the auditeur's report, there was found to be a statutory presumption of discontinuance on the part of the applicant in the main proceedings. The question thus arises whether in such circumstances that judgment should be regarded as that of a court adjudicating at last instance because the appeal proceedings did not give rise to an as assessment of the substance. The request by the applicant in the main proceedings for the Raad voor Vreemdelingenbetwistingen (Council for asylum and immigration proceedings) to refer a question to the Court for a preliminary ruling was refused on the ground that it had been made in a procedural document which, because of the date on which it was filed, could not be taken into account.</p>

        <p>30 By its first question, the referring court essentially asks whether the third paragraph of Article 267 TFEU must be interpreted as meaning that a court against whose decisions there is a judicial remedy under national law may nonetheless be regarded as a court adjudicating at last instance, where an appeal on a point of law against a decision of that court is not examined because of discontinuance by the appellant.</p>

            <p>It must be recalled, as a preliminary point, that in accordance with the third paragraph of Article 267 TFEU national courts against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law are required to make a reference to the Court (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 October 1982, Cilfit and Others, 283/81, EU:C:1982:335, paragraph 6).</p>

            <p>The obligation to refer a question to the Court for a preliminary ruling under the third paragraph of Article 267 TFEU is based on cooperation, established with a view to ensuring the proper application and uniform interpretation of EU law in all the Member States, between national courts, in their capacity as courts responsible for the application of EU law, and the Court (see, to that effect, judgment of 9 September 2015, X and van Dijk, C‑72/14 and C‑197/14, EU:C:2015:564, paragraph 54).</p>

            <p>Moreover, the obligation to make a reference laid down by the third paragraph of Article 267 TFEU is intended in particular to prevent a body of national case-law that is not in accordance with the rules of EU law from being established in any of the Member States (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 September 2015, Intermodal Transports, C‑495/03, EU:C:2005:552, paragraph 29).</p>

            <p>As the Court has pointed out on a number of occasions, a court adjudicating at last instance is by definition the last judicial body before which individuals may assert the rights conferred on them by EU law. Courts adjudicating at last instance have the task of ensuring at national level the uniform interpretation of rules of law (see, to that effect, judgments of 30 September 2003, Köbler, C‑224/01, EU:C:2003:513, paragraph 34, and of 13 June 2006, Traghetti del Mediterraneo, C‑173/03, EU:C:2006:391, paragraph 31).</p>

            <p>In this respect, it appears from the documents before the Court that, under Article 39/67 of the Law of 15 December 1980, decisions of the Raad voor Vreemdelingenbetwistingen (Council for asylum and immigration proceedings) may be the subject of the appeal on a point of law provided for in Article 14(2) of the Coordinated Laws on the Council of State.</p>

            <p>It follows that the Raad voor Vreemdelingenbetwistingen (Council for asylum and immigration proceedings) cannot be regarded as a court adjudicating at last instance, in so far as its decisions may be reviewed by a higher court before which individuals can assert the rights conferred on them by EU law. The decisions it makes do not therefore come from a national court against whose decisions there is no judicial remedy under national law within the meaning of the third paragraph of Article 267 TFEU.</p>

            <p>The fact that, in accordance with Article 18 of the Royal Decree of 30 November 2006 laying down the procedure for appeals on a point of law before the Council of State, an appellant who has brought an appeal on a point of law against a decision of the Raad voor Vreemdelingenbetwistingen (Council for asylum and immigration proceedings) is irrebuttably presumed to have discontinued the action if he fails to request the proceedings to be continued within a period of 30 days from the date on which he was served with the auditeur's report proposing that the appeal should be declared inadmissible or dismissed does not affect the fact that the decisions of the Raad voor Vreemdelingenbetwistingen (Council for asylum and immigration proceedings) can be challenged before a higher court, and consequently come from a court that is not adjudicating at last instance.</p>

            <p>In the light of the above considerations, the answer to Question 1 is that the third paragraph of Article 267 TFEU must be interpreted as meaning that a court against whose decisions there is a judicial remedy under national law may not be regarded as a court adjudicating at last instance, where an appeal on a point of law against a decision of that court is not examined because of discontinuance by the appellant.</p>

            <p>41 By its third question, the referring court essentially asks whether the third paragraph of Article 267 TFEU must be interpreted as meaning that a court adjudicating at last instance may decline to refer a question to the Court for a preliminary ruling where an appeal on a point of law has to be dismissed on grounds of inadmissibility specific to the procedure before that court.</p>

          <content eId="para_3612__content">
            <p>In this respect, it should be recalled, to begin with, that, where there is no judicial remedy against the decisions of a national court, that court is in principle obliged to make a reference to the Court within the meaning of the third paragraph of Article 267 TFEU where a question of the interpretation of the FEU Treaty is raised before it (judgment of 18 July 2013, Consiglio Nazionale dei Geologi, C‑136/12, EU:C:2013:489, paragraph 25).</p>

          <content eId="para_3613__content">
            <p>It follows from the relationship between the second and third paragraphs of Article 267 TFEU that the courts referred to in the third paragraph have the same discretion as all other national courts as to whether a decision on a question of EU law is necessary to enable them to give judgment. They are not therefore obliged to refer a question of the interpretation of EU law raised before them if the question is not relevant, that is to say, if the answer to that question, whatever it may be, cannot have any effect on the outcome of the case (judgment of 18 July 2013, Consiglio Nazionale dei Geologi, C‑136/12, EU:C:2013:489, paragraph 26).</p>

            <p>Consequently, if, in accordance with the procedural rules of the Member State concerned, the pleas in law raised before a court referred to in the third paragraph of Article 267 TFEU must be declared inadmissible, a request for a preliminary ruling cannot be regarded as necessary and relevant for that court to be able to give judgment.</p>

          <content eId="para_3615__content">
            <p>According to settled case-law of the Court, the justification for a request for a preliminary ruling is not that it enables advisory opinions on general or hypothetical questions to be delivered, but rather that it is necessary for the effective resolution of a dispute (judgment of 2 April 2009, Elshani, C‑459/07, EU:C:2009:224, paragraph 42).</p>

            <p>In the present case, as may be seen from the order for reference, the Hof van Cassatie (Court of Cassation) held that, because the appeal on a point of law against the judgment of the Strafuitvoeringsrechtbank van de Nederlandstalige rechtbank van eerste aanleg Brussel (Court of enforcement of penalties of the Court of First Instance (Dutch-speaking), Brussels) of 23 May 2012 was inadmissible, the formulation of a question to be referred to the Court was of no relevance, since the answer to that question could not have any effect on the outcome of the case.</p>

          <content eId="para_3618__content">
            <p>It should be recalled here that, according to settled case-law of the Court, in the absence of EU rules on the matter, it is for the national legal order of each Member State to establish procedural rules for actions intended to safeguard the rights of individuals, in accordance with the principle of procedural autonomy, on condition, however, that those rules are not less favourable than those governing similar domestic situations (principle of equivalence) and that they do not make it excessively difficult or impossible in practice to exercise the rights conferred by EU law (principle of effectiveness) (judgment of 17 March 2016, Bensada Benallal, C‑161/15, EU:C:2016:175, paragraph 24 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_3619__content">
            <p>It follows that two cumulative conditions, namely respect for the principles of equivalence and effectiveness, must be satisfied in order for a Member State to be able to assert the principle of procedural autonomy in situations which are governed by EU law (judgment of 17 March 2016, Bensada Benallal, C‑161/15, EU:C:2016:175, paragraph 25).</p>

            <p>First, as regards the principle of equivalence, it should be borne in mind that this requires that all the rules applicable to actions apply without distinction to actions alleging infringement of EU law and to similar actions alleging infringement of national law (see, to that effect, judgments of 16 January 2014, Pohl, C‑429/12, EU:C:2014:12, paragraph 26, and of 20 October 2016, Danqua, C‑429/15, EU:C:2016:789, paragraph 30).</p>

          <content eId="para_3622__content">
            <p>Secondly, as regards the principle of effectiveness, a national procedural rule such as that at issue in the main proceedings must not be such as to render impossible in practice or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by the EU legal order (judgment of 20 October 2016, Danqua, C‑429/15, EU:C:2016:789, paragraph 29).</p>

            <p>Moreover, according to the Court's case-law, each case that raises the question whether a national procedural provision renders the exercise of rights conferred on individuals by the EU legal order impossible or excessively difficult must be analysed by reference to the role of that provision in the procedure, its progress and its special features, viewed as a whole, before the various national instances. In that context, it is necessary to take into consideration, where relevant, the principles which lie at the basis of the national legal system, such as the protection of the rights of the defence, the principle of legal certainty and the proper conduct of the proceedings (judgment of 21 February 2008, Tele2 Communications, C‑426/05, EU:C:2008:103, paragraph 55).</p>
