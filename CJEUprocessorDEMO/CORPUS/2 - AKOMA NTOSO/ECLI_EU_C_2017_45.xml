Horizontal price-fixing ... agreements ..., which are usually secret, are, by their very nature, among the most harmful restrictions of competition. As a matter of policy, they will be heavily fined.

By that decision, it found that there had been an infringement of Article 101(1) TFEU and Article 53 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area of 2 May 1992 ( OJ 1994 L 1, p. 3) in the bathroom fittings and fixtures sector. That infringement, in which 17 undertakings had allegedly participated, was said to have taken place over various periods between 16 October 1992 and 9 November 2004 and to have taken the form of anticompetitive agreements or concerted practices covering the territory of Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria. According to the decision at issue, the products covered by the cartel were bathroom fittings and fixtures belonging to the following three product sub-groups: taps and fittings, shower enclosures and accessories, and ceramic sanitary ware (ceramics).</p>

The third plea alleged a failure to take into account the individual nature of Aloys F. Dornbracht's participation in the infringement found, in breach of the principle of equal treatment. The fourth plea alleged a failure to take into account other, earlier Commission decisions, in breach of the principle of equal treatment. The fifth plea alleged a failure to take into account Aloys F. Dornbracht's limited economic capacity, in breach of the principle of proportionality. The sixth plea alleged breach of the principle of non-retroactivity as a result of the application of the 2006 Guidelines. The seventh plea alleged breach by Article 23(3) of Regulation No 1/2003 of the principle nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege. The eighth plea alleged that the 2006 Guidelines are unlawful, in that they afford the Commission too much discretion.</p>

            <p>The appellant puts forward six grounds in support of its appeal. The first ground of appeal alleges infringement of Article 23(3) of Regulation No 1/2003 and breach of the principle nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege and of the principles of equal treatment and of proportionality as a result of the misapplication of the ceiling provided for in Article 23(2) of that regulation. By its second ground of appeal, the appellant criticises the judgment under appeal in that the General Court wrongly, it claims, rejected the plea of illegality raised against the 2006 Guidelines. The third ground of appeal alleges that the General Court failed to penalise the Commission's infringement of point 37 of the 2006 Guidelines. By its fourth ground of appeal, the appellant relies on a breach of the principle of non-retroactivity arising from the application of the 2006 Guidelines to the present case. The fifth ground of appeal alleges errors of law in the calculation of the amount of the fine imposed on the appellant. Lastly, the sixth ground of appeal alleges breach of the principle that the proceedings must be concluded within a reasonable time.</p>

            <p>By its first ground of appeal, directed against paragraphs 213 to 227 of the judgment under appeal, the appellant complains that the General Court infringed Article 23(3) of Regulation No 1/2003, as well as the principle nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege and the principles of equal treatment and of proportionality, when it held that the 10% limit laid down in Article 23(2) of that regulation imposes a ceiling which applies only to the final amount of the fine, thus denying that the determination of the amount of the fine imposed by the Commission in the present case was unlawful and making it impossible for the General Court itself to reduce it. Such an interpretation would mean that a fine of 10% of the total turnover of the undertaking concerned would be imposed in virtually every case, irrespective of the gravity and duration of the infringement at issue.</p>

            <p>Referring, in particular, to a decision of the Kartellsenat of the Bundesgerichtshof (Cartel Panel of the Federal Court of Justice, Germany), the appellant submits that the 10% limit provided for in Article 23(2) of Regulation No 1/2003 imposes no such ceiling but sets the upper limit of the scale of fines, which should be applied only in respect of the most serious infringements. Such an approach would enable appropriate account to be taken of the gravity and duration of an infringement, as provided for in Article 23(3) of that regulation.</p>

            <p>In so far as, on the one hand, by its first ground of appeal, the appellant essentially complains that the General Court misinterpreted Article 23(2) of Regulation No 1/2003 in holding that it imposes a ceiling, it must be noted that the General Court, without adopting that position, correctly stated in paragraph 216 of the judgment under appeal that it is apparent from the settled case-law of the Court of Justice that it is only the final amount of the fine imposed which must comply with that upper limit of 10% of turnover referred to in that provision, and that that provision does not prohibit the Commission from arriving, during the various stages of calculation of the fine, at an intermediate amount higher than that limit, provided that the final amount of the fine does not exceed that limit (see, in particular, judgments of 28 June 2005, Dansk Rørindustri and Others v Commission, C‑189/02 P, C‑202/02 P, C‑205/02 P to C‑208/02 P and C‑213/02 P, EU:C:2005:408, paragraphs 277 and 278; of 29 June 2006, SGL Carbon v Commission, C‑308/04 P, EU:C:2006:433, paragraph 82; and of 12 July 2012, Cetarsa v Commission, C‑181/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:455, paragraph 80).</p>

            <p>On the other hand, as regards the complaints that the General Court infringed Article 23(3) of Regulation No 1/2003 and, therefore, the principle nullum crimen, nulla poena sine lege and the principles of equal treatment and of proportionality on the ground that it failed to take into account in an appropriate manner the gravity and duration of the infringements, it should be borne in mind that the Court has consistently held that the fact that, owing to the application of the limit of 10% of turnover referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 23(2) of that regulation, certain factors such as the gravity and duration of the infringement are not actually reflected in the amount of the fine imposed is merely a consequence of the application of that upper limit to the final amount (see, in particular, judgments of 28 June 2005, Dansk Rørindustri and Others v Commission, C‑189/02 P, C‑202/02 P, C‑205/02 P to C‑208/02 P and C‑213/02 P, EU:C:2005:408, paragraph 279, and of 12 July 2012, Cetarsa v Commission, C‑181/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:455, paragraph 81).</p>

The application of the method of setting fines described by the 2006 Guidelines means that the criteria of the duration and gravity of infringements committed by those undertakings, to which Article 23(3) of Regulation No 1/2003 refers, are not, therefore, taken into account in an appropriate manner.

In reality, such an appeal amounts to no more than a request for re-examination of the application submitted to the General Court, which falls outside the jurisdiction of the Court of Justice (see, in particular, judgments of 30 June 2005, Eurocermex v OHIM, C‑286/04 P, EU:C:2005:422, paragraphs 49 and 50, and of 12 September 2006, Reynolds Tobacco and Others v Commission, C‑131/03 P, EU:C:2006:541, paragraphs 49 and 50).</p>

            <p>The appellant submits in this regard that it is true that the Court ruled in its judgment of 28 June 2005, Dansk Rørindustri and Others v Commission ( C‑189/02 P, C‑202/02 P, C‑205/02 P to C‑208/02 P and C‑213/02 P, EU:C:2005:408, paragraph 231), that the Commission could, without disregarding the principle of non-retroactivity, calculate the amount of the fine on the basis of the 1998 Guidelines, even though they had been adopted after the infringement at issue in that case was committed, since those guidelines and the new method of calculation they contained were reasonably foreseeable at the time when that infringement was committed. However, according to the appellant, in the case giving rise to that judgment, there were no guidelines at the time when the infringement was committed, and therefore the question that arose was whether or not the fine had to be calculated on the basis of the new guidelines which the Commission first adopted in 1998. Contrary to what the General Court found in the judgment under appeal, that situation should, in the appellant's submission, be distinguished from a situation in which guidelines were applicable at the time when the infringement was committed but have been replaced or amended by new guidelines since that infringement. In the latter situation, the question arises as to which guidelines, the old or the new, should be applied for the purposes of calculating the amount of the fine. The General Court's application in the second situation of the approach adopted in the judgment of 28 June 2005, Dansk Rørindustri and Others v Commission ( C‑189/02 P, C‑202/02 P, C‑205/02 P to C‑208/02 P and C‑213/02 P, EU:C:2005:408), is, the appellant claims, contrary to the principles of equal treatment and of the protection of legitimate expectations.</p>

            <p>As regards, first, the argument put forward in the second part of that ground of appeal, alleging that the General Court made an error of assessment as to the product groups to which the infringement the appellant is said to have committed related, it must be noted, as the General Court stated in paragraph 51 of the judgment under appeal, that, in accordance with Article 44(1)(c) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court, in the version in force at the date of the judgment under appeal, the subject matter of the dispute and a summary of the pleas in law relied on constitute two essential elements which must be included in the application initiating proceedings, and that, under Article 48(2) of those rules of procedure, no new plea in law may be introduced in the course of proceedings unless it is based on matters of law or fact which have come to light in the course of the procedure (see, to that effect, judgments of 12 November 2009, SGL Carbon v Commission, C‑564/08 P, not published, EU:C:2009:703, paragraph 21, and of 3 April 2014, France v Commission, C‑559/12 P, EU:C:2014:217, paragraph 38). As the General Court found, however, the appellant disputed its awareness of the fact that the infringement covered three product sub-groups only in its reply before the General Court, and that argument did not amplify a complaint made in the application at first instance. Consequently, the General Court was fully entitled to reject it as being out of time, in paragraphs 53, 54, 114 and 171 of the judgment under appeal.</p>

            <p>In so far as, by the second part of its fifth ground of appeal, the appellant maintains that the General Court should have taken into account the fact that its activity was limited to only one of the three product sub-groups, suffice it to note that the General Court did in fact take that into account. Thus, in paragraph 154 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court stated that that fact had been taken into account by the Commission when calculating the value of sales on the basis of which the fine was calculated.</p>

            <p>Secondly, with regard to the complaint raised in the third part of this ground of appeal, according to which the General Court did not draw the appropriate conclusions from the appellant's exclusively `follow-my-leader' role when it set the fine to be imposed, it must be noted that that complaint is based on the premiss that the 1998 Guidelines, not those of 2006, were required to be applied in the present case. Since, in this case, the Commission applied the 2006 Guidelines, on which the General Court decided to draw in paragraph 246 of the judgment under appeal, and those guidelines do not provide for account to be taken of an exclusively passive or `follow-my-leader' role in bringing about the infringement, that complaint must be rejected.</p>

            <p>As regards, in the first place, the appellant's arguments alleging that the General Court made errors of assessment in relation in particular to the geographic scope of the infringement when determining, in the exercise of its unlimited jurisdiction, the amount of the fine, it should be noted at the outset that the General Court alone has jurisdiction to examine how in each particular case the Commission assessed the gravity of unlawful conduct. In an appeal, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, first, to examine to what extent the General Court took into consideration, in a legally correct manner, all the essential factors to assess the gravity of particular conduct in the light of Article 101 TFEU and Article 23 of Regulation No 1/2003 and, secondly, to consider whether the General Court responded to a sufficient legal standard to all the arguments raised in support of the claim for cancellation or reduction of the fine (see, inter alia, judgments of 17 December 1998, Baustahlgewebe v Commission, C‑185/95 P, EU:C:1998:608, paragraph 128; of 28 June 2005, Dansk Rørindustri and Others v Commission, C‑189/02 P, C‑202/02 P, C‑205/02 P to C‑208/02 P and C‑213/02 P, EU:C:2005:408, paragraph 244; and of 5 December 2013, Solvay Solexis v Commission, C‑449/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:802, paragraph 74).</p>

In the light of paragraphs 57 to 64 of the present judgment, the General Court was fully entitled, however, not to take into account for that purpose the appellant's assertion that the infringement concerned only one of the three product sub-groups or the `follow-my-leader' role of the appellant.</p>

            <p>Lastly, in paragraph 249 of the judgment under appeal, in view not only of the very nature of that infringement, but also its geographic scope -- the territory of two Member States -- and its long duration, the General Court found that the infringement was among the most harmful restrictions and considered that, having regard to point 23 of the 2006 Guidelines, for such an infringement, the proportion of the value of sales of 15% corresponded to a minimum.</p>

            <p>Consequently, in paragraph 250 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court considered it appropriate, for the calculation of the basic amount of the fine imposed on the appellant, to set both the `gravity of the infringement' multiplier and the `additional amount' multiplier at 15%.</p>

            <p>It follows from the foregoing that, contrary to what is claimed by the appellant, the General Court did take into account the fact that the geographic scope of the infringement covered only two Member States and not six. However, the General Court found that, despite the more limited geographic scope, a rate of 15% was appropriate in the light, inter alia, of the nature of the infringement. It should be pointed out in that respect that, having regard to point 23 of the 2006 Guidelines, on which the General Court decided to draw in this case, the 15% multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount' were warranted in view of the very nature of the infringement at issue, since, as the General Court noted, it is among the most harmful restrictions of competition for the purpose of point 23 of the 2006 Guidelines and that rate is the lowest rate on the scale of penalties prescribed for such infringements under those guidelines (in that regard, see, to that effect, judgments of 11 July 2013, Ziegler v Commission, C‑439/11 P, EU:C:2013:513, paragraphs 124 and 125, and of 11 July 2013, Team Relocations and Others v Commission, C‑444/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:464, paragraph 125). Accordingly, the appellant is wrong to criticise the General Court for having failed to take into account the geographic scope of the infringement when determining the multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and the `additional amount', and for having set those multipliers at 15%.</p>

            <p>That conclusion cannot be called into question on the ground that the rate is the same as that set for other undertakings whose participation in the infringement covered a larger geographic area than that established in the appellant's case, which, according to the appellant, is contrary to the principle of equal treatment.</p>

            <p>It will be recalled that that principle is a general principle of EU law enshrined in Articles 20 and 21 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. According to settled case-law, that principle requires that comparable situations must not be treated differently and different situations must not be treated in the same way unless such treatment is objectively justified (see, inter alia, judgment of 12 November 2014, Guardian Industries and Guardian Europe v Commission, C‑580/12 P, EU:C:2014:2363, paragraph 51).</p>

            <p>Observance of that principle is binding, in particular, on the General Court not only in the exercise of its review of the legality of the Commission's decision imposing fines but also in the exercise of its unlimited jurisdiction. When the amount of the fines imposed is determined, the exercise of such jurisdiction cannot result in discrimination between undertakings which have participated in an agreement or concerted practice contrary to Article 101(1) TFEU (see, to that effect, judgment of 18 December 2014, Commission v Parker Hannifin Manufacturing and Parker-Hannifin, C‑434/13 P, EU:C:2014:2456, paragraph 77).</p>

            <p>It follows from the case-law of the Court of Justice, however, that the taking into account, by virtue of the principle of equal treatment, of differences between the undertakings that have participated in a single cartel (in particular with regard to the geographic scope of their respective involvement) need not necessarily occur when the multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount' are set but may occur at another stage in the setting of the fine, such as when the basic amount of the fine is adjusted in the light of mitigating and aggravating circumstances under points 28 and 29 of the 2006 Guidelines (see, to that effect, judgments of 11 July 2013, Gosselin Group v Commission, C‑429/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:463, paragraphs 96 to 100, and of 11 July 2013, Team Relocations and Others v Commission, C‑444/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:464, paragraphs 104 and 105).</p>

            <p>As the Commission has observed, such differences may also be reflected by means of the value of sales that is used in calculating the basic amount of the fine inasmuch as that value reflects, for each participating undertaking, the scale of its involvement in the infringement in question, in accordance with point 13 of the 2006 Guidelines, under which it is possible to take as a starting point for the calculation of the fines an amount which reflects the economic significance of the infringement and the size of the undertaking's contribution to it (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 July 2013, Team Relocations and Others v Commission, C‑444/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:464, paragraph 76).</p>

Contrary to what is maintained by the appellant, the General Court listed, in paragraph 249 of the judgment under appeal, the factors it took into account in order to determine the multipliers for the `gravity of the infringement' and for the `additional amount' and stated that, under point 23 of the 2006 Guidelines and in view of the scale from 0% to 30% provided for therein, the infringement at issue, which was among the most harmful, warranted a rate of 15%.</p>

            <p>By its sixth ground of appeal, the appellant claims that the General Court infringed its obligation to adjudicate on the cases before it within a reasonable time. It observes that the proceedings before the General Court commenced on 8 September 2010 and ended more than three years later, namely on 16 September 2013, the date on which the judgment under appeal was delivered. That period is, it claims, in the light of the relevant case-law and having regard to the particular circumstances of that case, particularly long and excessive.</p>

            <p>In so far as the appellant, by its sixth ground of appeal, asks the Court, in the first place, to set aside the judgment under appeal on account of the excessive duration of the proceedings before the General Court, it should be noted that, in the absence of any evidence that the excessive duration of those proceedings had an effect on the outcome of the dispute, failure on the part of the General Court to adjudicate within a reasonable time cannot lead to the judgment under appeal being set aside. Indeed, where failure to adjudicate within a reasonable time has no effect on the outcome of the dispute, the setting aside of the judgment under appeal would not provide a remedy for any infringement by the General Court of the principle of effective judicial protection (judgments of 26 November 2013, Gascogne Sack Deutschland v Commission, C‑40/12 P, EU:C:2013:768, paragraphs 81 and 82; of 26 November 2013, Kendrion v Commission, C‑50/12 P, EU:C:2013:771, paragraphs 82 and 83; and of 10 July 2014, Telefónica and Telefónica de España v Commission, C‑295/12 P, EU:C:2014:2062, paragraph 64).</p>

            <p>In so far as, by its sixth ground of appeal, the appellant seeks, in the second place and in the alternative, a reduction of the fine imposed on it, it should be noted that the sanction for a breach, by a court of the European Union, of its obligation under the second paragraph of Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union to adjudicate on the cases before it within a reasonable time must be an action for damages brought before the General Court, since such an action constitutes an effective remedy. Accordingly, a claim for compensation for the damage caused by the failure on the part of the General Court to adjudicate within a reasonable time may not be made directly to the Court of Justice in the context of an appeal, but must be brought before the General Court itself (judgments of 10 July 2014, Telefónica and Telefónica de España v Commission, C‑295/12 P, EU:C:2014:2062, paragraph 66; of 9 October 2014, ICF v Commission, C‑467/13 P, not published, EU:C:2014:2274, paragraph 57; and of 21 January 2016, Galp Energía España and Others v Commission, C‑603/13 P, EU:C:2016:38, paragraph 55).</p>

            <p>Where a claim for damages is brought before the General Court, which has jurisdiction under Article 256(1) TFEU, it must determine such a claim sitting in a different composition from that which heard the dispute giving rise to the procedure whose duration is criticised (see, to that effect, judgments of 10 July 2014, Telefónica and Telefónica de España v Commission, C‑295/12 P, EU:C:2014:2062, paragraph 67; of 9 October 2014, ICF v Commission, C‑467/13 P, not published, EU:C:2014:2274, paragraph 58; and of 21 January 2016, Galp Energía España and Others v Commission, C‑603/13 P, EU:C:2016:38, paragraph 56).</p>

          <content eId="para_9496__content">
            <p>Nonetheless, where it is evident, without it being necessary for the parties to adduce additional evidence in that regard, that the General Court has breached, in a sufficiently serious manner, its duty to adjudicate within a reasonable period, the Court of Justice can find accordingly (see, to that effect, judgments of 9 October 2014, ICF v Commission, C‑467/13 P, not published, EU:C:2014:2274, paragraph 59; and of 21 January 2016, Galp Energía España and Others v Commission, C‑603/13 P, EU:C:2016:38, paragraph 57).</p>

            <p>However, in the present case, having regard in particular to the nature and the degree of complexity of the case and the number of actions brought against the decision at issue, it does not appear that the duration of the proceedings before the General Court -- approximately three years -- was manifestly unreasonable.</p>
