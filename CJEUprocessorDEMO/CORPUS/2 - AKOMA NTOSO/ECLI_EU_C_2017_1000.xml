            <p>By a notice published in the Official Journal of the European Union on 27 July 2013 (S 145-251280), the Province of Bolzano launched an open tendering procedure for the award of a public works contract concerning the financing, design of the final executive project, construction and management of the new Bolzano correctional facility.

            <p>Mantovani submitted a request for participation on 16 December 2013 in its own name and as lead contractor of a temporary association of undertakings which was to be established. That undertaking produced two declarations concerning compliance with the general requirements laid down in Article 38 of Legislative Decree No 163/2006. On 4 December 2013, it stated that Mr B., in his capacity as Chairman of the Board, Managing Director and legal representative who had ceased to perform his duties on 6 March 2013, had not been the subject of a conviction having the force of res judicata. On 16 December 2013, Mantovani reiterated that declaration.</p>

            <p>At its meeting on 9 January 2014, the contracting authority conditionally authorised Mantovani's application, while awaiting it to provide further information with respect to Mr B. An article in the local press, published on 6 December 2013, revealed that Mr B. had been the subject of a criminal prosecution, for having instigated a system of false invoices, and had negotiated a plea entailing a conviction and sentence of 1 year and 10 months' imprisonment.</p>

            <p>Subsequently, the contracting authority obtained Mr B.'s criminal record, which showed that that conviction was handed down on 5 December 2013, and became final on 29 March 2014. At its meeting on 29 May 2014, the contracting authority requested Mantovani to provide it with details of that conviction.</p>

            <p>Mantovani replied by claiming, inter alia, that Mr B.'s conviction had become final following its own declarations of 4 and 16 December 2013, the judgment of 6 December 2013 having been given in camera without any public hearing, and its publication having occurred only on 3 February 2014. Mantovani further stated that, in order to fully and effectively dissociate the company from Mr B.'s actions, the latter was immediately removed from his management role in the Mantovani group, the management bodies of the company had been reorganised, Mr B.'s shares had been bought back and an action for damages had been brought against him.</p>

            <p>After having established a classification in which Mantovani was conditionally positioned in fifth place, the contracting authority requested an opinion from the</p>

            </p>
            <p>replied, in essence, that although, in the absence of a final judgment, Mantovani's statement could not be classified as a `misrepresentation', the lack of timely notification of criminal proceedings concerning one of the persons mentioned in Article 38(1)(c) of Legislative Decree No 163/2006 may constitute an infringement of the obligation of sincere cooperation with the contracting authority, and accordingly impede the full and effective dissociation from the person concerned.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the contracting authority decided, at its meeting of 27 February 2015, to exclude Mantovani from the tender procedure. According to the minutes of that meeting, it was found that the general requirements laid down in Article 38 of Legislative Decree No 163/2006 were not met `because of the late and inadequate information provided by the company in order to prove that it had dissociated itself from the criminal conduct of the person having ceased to perform management functions' and that the conviction `was handed down prior to the statement submitted in the tender procedure and could, as such, have been notified by Mantovani at the stage when its participation was being assessed'.</p>

            <p>Mantovani brought an action before the Tribunale regionale di giustizia amministrativa, Sezione Autonoma di Bolzano (Regional Administrative Court, Autonomous Division of Bolzano, Italy) against that exclusion decision. By judgment of 27 August 2015, that court confirmed the lawfulness of the exclusion, on the basis that Mr B.'s conviction could have been the subject of a declaration during the tendering procedure and that only a tenderer who submitted factually accurate statements without misleading the contracting authority was entitled to claim the benefit of the dissociation referred to in Article 38(1)(c) of Legislative Decree No 163/2006.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the Consiglio di Stato (Council of State) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling: `Is it contrary to the correct application of Article 45(2)(c) and (g) and Article 45(3)(a) of Directive 2004/18, and of the EU law principles of protection of legitimate expectations and legal certainty, equal treatment, proportionality and transparency, of the prohibition of making the procedure more cumbersome, and of the greatest possible openness to competition of public tender procedures, as well as of the principle of completeness and accuracy of the requirements governing the implementation of penalties, for national legislation such as Article 38(1)(c) of Legislative Decree [No 163/2006] to extend the legal obligation to make a declaration regarding the absence of convictions by way of final judgment (including judgments implementing a sentence resulting from a negotiated plea), for the offences referred to in that provision, to office holders in the companies intending to submit a tender who ceased to hold office in the year preceding the publication of the tender notice, which amounts to a corresponding ground for exclusion of that company from the call for tenders if the undertaking fails to show that there has been complete and genuine dissociation from the conduct which carries criminal sanctions, where assessment of compliance with the dissociation requirement is a matter for the contracting authority, which contracting authority can effectively introduce certain obligations entailing the exclusion of the tenderer in the event that they are not fulfilled, namely:</p>

            <p>The Province of Bolzano takes the view that the reference for a preliminary ruling is inadmissible. In its view, the Court of Justice has already ruled, in the judgment of 10 July 2014, Consorzio Stabile Libor Lavori Pubblici ( C‑358/12, EU:C:2014:2063), on an issue relating to the interpretation of Article 45(2) of Directive 2004/18 which is similar to that raised in the present case.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it is sufficient to note that a request for a preliminary ruling on interpretation is not inadmissible simply because it is similar to a request for a preliminary ruling on which the Court has already ruled. In any event, the case which gave rise to the judgment referred to in the previous paragraph concerned a different legal situation, characterised by the exclusion of a tenderer for non-payment of social security contributions in the context of a tendering procedure to which only the fundamental rules and general principles of the FEU Treaty were applicable, since the threshold laid down in Article 7(c) of Directive 2004/18 had not been reached.</p>

            <p>The Province of Bolzano is of the opinion, moreover, that the question referred for a preliminary ruling has no connection with the main proceedings, since the exclusion was not a penalty for breach of the requirement governing notification or reporting, but for the lack of full and effective dissociation between Mantovani and the conduct of Mr B., its former director. Moreover, the reference to the ground for exclusion relating to misrepresentation referred to in Article 45(2)(g) and (3) of Directive 2004/18 is neither relevant nor decisive.</p>

Nonetheless, that court stated that it was faced with the question of whether EU law permits the taking into consideration of the absence of a declaration concerning criminal proceedings against former directors of the tendering company, who have not yet been the subject of a final judgment.</p>

It was in particular criticised for not having indicated, in its statements of 4 and 16 December 2013, that its former director was the subject of criminal proceedings which resulted in a conviction negotiated in camera on 6 December 2013.</p>

It is, in that regard, for the Court to extract from all the information provided by the referring court, in particular from the grounds of the order for reference, the points of EU law which require interpretation in view of the subject matter of the dispute (see, inter alia, judgment of 22 October 2015, Impresa Edilux and SICEF, C‑425/14, EU:C:2015:721, paragraph 20 and the case-law cited).</p>

In that context, Member States have the power to make the criteria laid down in Article 45(2) less onerous or more flexible (judgment of 14 December 2016, Connexxion Taxi Services, C‑171/15, EU:C:2016:948, paragraph 29 and the case-law cited).</p>

Conduct contrary to the professional ethics of those representatives may thus constitute a relevant factor in assessing the professional conduct of an undertaking. It is thus perfectly permissible for Member States to retain, as part of the exercise of their powers to determine the requirements governing the application of the optional grounds for exclusion, among the relevant factors in assessing the integrity of the tendering company, the possibility that certain actions of directors of that company are contrary to professional ethics.</p>

            <p>As regards the principle of legal certainty, of the protection of legitimate expectations and of the principle of transparency, the request for a preliminary ruling gives no indication of how those principles may need to be interpreted in the light of the case in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>As regards the principle of proportionality, it is necessary to examine its application in the light of the impact of the date from which the wrongful conduct of the administrator may be regarded as leading to the exclusion of the tendering company. If the intervening period is too significant, the national legislation is likely to reduce the scope of the EU directives on public procurement.</p>

            <p>In that context, the taking into account of wrongful conduct during the year preceding the date of publication of the tender notice does not appear to be disproportionate, especially since the legislation at issue in the main proceedings provides that an undertaking may prove that it effectively and completely dissociated itself from the conduct of its director.</p>

            <p>In the light of all of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the question referred is that Directive 2004/18, in particular Article 45(2)(c), (d) and (g) of that directive, and the principles of equal treatment and proportionality, must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which allows the contracting authority:</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby rules: Directive 2004/18/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 31 March 2004 on the coordination of procedures for the award of public works contracts, public supply contracts and public service contracts, in particular Article 45(2)(c), (d) and (g) of that directive, and the principles of equal treatment and proportionality, must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which allows the contracting authority:</p>
