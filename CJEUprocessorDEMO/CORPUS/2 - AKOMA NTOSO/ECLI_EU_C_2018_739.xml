However, such a decision could be replaced by a subsequent decision by the court of the Member State of habitual residence of the child prior to the wrongful removal or retention.

            <p>The Court held in those judgments that an anti-suit injunction, that is to say, an injunction intended to prohibit a person from commencing or continuing proceedings before the courts of another Member State, was incompatible with the Convention concluded on 27 September 1968 on Jurisdiction and the Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters ( OJ 1978 L 304, p. 36), and also with Council Regulation (EC) No 44/2001 of 22 December 2000 on jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters ( OJ 2001 L 12, p. 1), since such an injunction does not observe the principle that every court seised itself determines, under the rules applicable to it, whether it has jurisdiction to resolve the dispute before it. Such an interference with the jurisdiction of a court of another Member State is also incompatible with the system of mutual trust which forms the basis for the establishment of a mandatory system of jurisdiction which all courts falling within the scope of those legal instruments are required to respect (judgments of 27 April 2004, Turner, C‑159/02, EU:C:2004:228, paragraphs 24 and 25; of 10 February 2009, Allianz and Generali Assicurazioni Generali, C‑185/07, EU:C:2009:69, paragraphs 29 and 30; and of 13 May 2015, Gazprom, C‑536/13, EU:C:2015:316, paragraphs 33 and 34).</p>

            <p>In the present case, it must be concluded, in accordance with that case-law, that Regulation No 2201/2003, in particular Article 26 thereof, does not enable an injunction to be granted that is intended to prevent HCC from commencing judicial proceedings in the United Kingdom in relation to the adoption of the children or to challenge the jurisdiction of the English courts in that respect.</p>

            <p>However, it must be held that an injunction such as that sought by the parents concerned would, according to the information provided by the referring court and as noted by the Advocate General in points 153 and 154 of her Opinion, have neither the purpose nor the effect of preventing HCC from seising an English court in respect of the same subject matter as that of the dispute pending before the referring court, since a judicial adoption procedure commenced or continued in the United Kingdom has a subject matter and effects that are distinct from those of the proceedings based on Regulation No 2201/2003 concerning the return of the children and intended to preserve the right of appeal of the parents concerned.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, according to the actual wording of Article 1(3)(b) of Regulation No 2201/2003, the decision on that adoption and the measures preparatory to it do not fall within the scope of the regulation.</p>

            <p>Having regard to all of the above, the answer to the fourth question is that Regulation No 2201/2003 must be interpreted as not precluding, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, a court of one Member State from adopting protective measures in the form of an injunction directed at a public body of another Member State, preventing that body from commencing or continuing, before the courts of that other Member State, proceedings for the adoption of children who are residing there.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules: 1. The general provisions of Chapter III of Council Regulation (EC) No 2201/2003 of 27 November 2003 concerning jurisdiction and the recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial matters and the matters of parental responsibility, repealing Regulation (EC) No 1347/2000, must be interpreted as meaning that, where it is alleged that children have been wrongfully removed, the decision of a court of the Member State in which those children were habitually resident, directing that those children be returned and which is entailed by a decision dealing with parental responsibility, may be declared enforceable in the host Member State in accordance with those general provisions. 2. Article 33(1) of Regulation No 2201/2003, read in the light of Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, must be interpreted as precluding, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, enforcement of a decision of a court of a Member State which directs that children be made wards of court and that they be returned and which is declared enforceable in the requested Member State, prior to service of the declaration of enforceability of that decision on the parents concerned. Article 33(5) of Regulation No 2201/2003 must be interpreted as meaning that the period for lodging an appeal laid down in that provision may not be extended by the court seised. 3. Regulation No 2201/2003 must be interpreted as not precluding, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, a court of one Member State from adopting protective measures in the form of an injunction directed at a public body of another Member State, preventing that body from commencing or continuing, before the courts of that other Member State, proceedings for the adoption of children who are residing there.</p>
