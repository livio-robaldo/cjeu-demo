            <p>According to the national court, it is necessary to seek a uniform application of the provisions of those directives within the European Union. Therefore, although the dispute which it must resolve relates to transactions carried out outside the territorial scope of those directives, the question that arises is whether the sale and installation of photovoltaic panels and solar water heaters on buildings or with a view to supplying buildings with electricity or hot water constitute a single transaction that can be characterised as works of construction within the meaning of those directives.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be borne in mind that the Court has repeatedly held that it has jurisdiction to give preliminary rulings on questions concerning provisions of EU law in situations where the facts of the cases being considered by the national courts were outside the scope of EU law but where those provisions of EU law had been rendered applicable by domestic law due to a reference made by that law to the content of those provisions (see, to that effect, judgments of 21 December 2011, Cicala, C‑482/10, EU:C:2011:868, paragraph 17 and the case-law cited, and of 18 October 2012, Nolan, C‑583/10, EU:C:2012:638, paragraph 45).</p>

          <content eId="para_993__content">
            <p>Where, in regulating situations outside the scope of the EU measure concerned, national legislation seeks to adopt the same solutions as those adopted in that measure, it is clearly in the interest of the European Union that, in order to forestall future differences of interpretation, provisions taken from that measure should be interpreted uniformly (see, to that effect, judgments of 7 July 2011, Agafiţei and Others, C‑310/10, EU:C:2011:467, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited, and of 18 October 2012, Nolan, C‑583/10, EU:C:2012:638, paragraph 46).</p>

          <content eId="para_994__content">
            <p>Thus, an interpretation, by the Court, of provisions of EU law in situations outside its scope is justified where those provisions have been made applicable to such situations by national law directly and unconditionally, in order to ensure that those internal situations and situations governed by EU law are treated in the same way (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 December 2011, Cicala, C‑482/10, EU:C:2012:868, paragraph 19 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the present case, the referring court asks whether the sale and installation of photovoltaic panels and solar water heaters on buildings or with a view to supplying electricity or hot water to buildings constitute a single transaction that may be characterised as works of construction, within the meaning of the Sixth Directive and the VAT Directive, explaining that Article 256 of the CGI ensures that the relevant provisions of those directives are transposed into national law and that those concepts have the same scope with regard to the overseas departments -- territories which are expressly excluded from the scope of those directives.</p>

            <p>An EU interest in the uniform interpretation of the concepts of `works of construction' and `single transaction that may be characterised as works of construction', in order to forestall future differences in interpretation, is indeed conceivable.</p>

            <p>However, as the Advocate General stated in points 41 to 44 of his Opinion, in the first place, the relevant provisions of the Sixth Directive and of the VAT Directive cannot be regarded as having been transposed by Article 256 of the CGI.</p>

            <p>Whereas Article 5(5) of the Sixth Directive and Article 14(3) of the VAT Directive establish the right of Member States to regard the handing over of certain works of construction as a supply of goods, Article 256 of the CGI provides, on the contrary, that works of construction are to be regarded as supplies of services.</p>

            <p>In the second place, Articles 256 and 295 of the CGI cannot constitute, for the purposes of the case-law recalled in paragraph 27 of this judgment, a direct and unconditional reference to the relevant provisions of the directives.</p>

            <p>First, the choice made in Article 256 of the CGI only allows it to be inferred a contrario that works of construction, like all transactions that do not constitute supplies of goods, fall within the scope of Article 6(1) of the Sixth Directive and Article 24(1) of the VAT Directive.</p>

            <p>Second, Article 295 of the CGI, which establishes an exemption system, derogating from the rules applicable on metropolitan French territory, for goods supplied in territories expressly excluded from the scope of the Sixth Directive and of the VAT Directive, cannot be regarded as referring directly and unconditionally to the provisions of those directives.</p>

            <p>The request for a preliminary ruling has been, moreover, made specifically because, as regards the overseas departments to which the Sixth Directive and the VAT Directive do not apply, there are special provisions which provide for the exemption of the sale of photovoltaic panels and solar water heaters.</p>

            <p>Therefore, with regard to the solutions for situations that are outside the scope of the EU measures concerned, the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings is not consistent with the solutions adopted by the Sixth Directive and the VAT Directive, in so far as it establishes an exemption which is not provided for in those directives. It cannot therefore be held that the provisions of those directives were rendered directly and unconditionally applicable by national law to situations outside the scope of those directives.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fifth Chamber) hereby rules: The Court of Justice of the European Union does not have jurisdiction to answer the question referred by the Conseil d'État (Council of State, France) by decision of 20 May 2016.</p>
