No 309/1962), which is still applicable in bilateral relations with the Czech Republic (BGBl. III No 123/1997 ( `the Austrian-Czech Treaty')).</p>

            <p>That court refused that request, by decision of 18 July 2014, on the ground that the signature of the applicant in the main proceedings had not been authenticated by a court or a notary, contrary to the requirements of Article 53(3) of the GBG. Moreover, according to that court, authentication of the signature by a Czech lawyer is not covered by the Austrian-Czech Treaty. In any event, it took the view that the endorsement submitted by Ms Piringer did not bear the stamp of an official seal, as required by Articles 21 and 22 of that treaty.</p>

            <p>By an order of 25 November 2015, the Landesgericht Linz (Linz Regional Court, Austria) confirmed the decision delivered on 18 July 2014, finding in particular that, although the declaration of the authenticity of the signature constituted a public instrument under Czech law, the recognition of such a declaration in Austria was covered by Article 21(2) of the Austrian-Czech Treaty. Given that, under that provision, mutual recognition applies only to the certificate attesting the veracity of the signature of a private instrument that has been appended to that instrument by `a court, an administrative body or an Austrian notary', extending the scope of its application to certificates appended by Czech lawyers would, it held, be contrary not only to Article 21(2) but to the intention of the contracting parties themselves.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it follows from the second paragraph of Article 252 TFEU that it is the duty of the Advocate General, acting with complete impartiality and independence, to make, in open court, reasoned submissions on cases which require his involvement. The Court is not bound either by the Advocate General's Opinion or by the reasoning on which it is based (judgment of 21 December 2016, Council v Front Polisario, C‑104/16 P, EU:C:2016:973, paragraph 60 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>As a consequence, the fact that a party disagrees with that Opinion, irrespective of the questions examined therein, cannot in itself constitute grounds justifying the reopening of the oral procedure (judgment of 21 December 2016, Council v Front Polisario, C‑104/16 P, EU:C:2016:973, paragraph 61 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>That said, it should be recalled that the Court, under Article 83 of the Rules of Procedure, may at any time, after hearing the Advocate General, order that the oral procedure be reopened, in particular if it considers that it lacks sufficient information or where the case must be decided on the basis of an argument that has not been debated between the parties or the interested persons referred to in Article 23 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union.</p>

            <p>In this regard, it must be borne in mind that Directive 77/249, the purpose of which is to facilitate the effective exercise by lawyers of the freedom to provide services (judgment of 19 January 1988, Gullung, 292/86, EU:C:1988:15, paragraph 15), applies, in accordance with the wording of Article 1(1) thereof, to the activities of lawyers pursued by way of provision of services.</p>

            <p>It is therefore necessary to verify, in the first place, whether the authentication of a signature appended to a request for entry in the land register, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, constitutes a `lawyer's activity' and, in the second place, whether that authentication was effected in the context of the free provision of services, within the meaning of that provision.</p>

            <p>In the first place, it must be stated that Directive 77/249 does not expressly define what is covered by the term `lawyer's activity' within its meaning. Even though that directive draws a distinction between, on the one hand, activities relating to the representation of a client in legal proceedings or before public authorities and, on the other hand, all other activities, pursuant to, inter alia, Article 4(4) thereof (see judgment of 30 November 1995, Gebhard, C‑55/94, EU:C:1995:411, paragraph 14), it does not define the scope of those expressions.</p>

            <p>However, with regard to the actual notion of `lawyer', within the meaning of Directive 77/249, Article 1(2) thereof states that that notion is to be taken to mean `any person entitled to pursue his professional activities under one of the ... designations' applicable in each Member State. By that definition, the EU legislature left it to the Member States to define that notion themselves and referred to the designations used in each Member State to identify the persons entitled to pursue those professional activities.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the view must be taken that, so far as concerns also the definition of activities that may be pursued by lawyers, in the absence of any precise indication in Directive 77/249, the EU legislature wished to preserve the power of the Member States to determine the meaning of that notion by thus leaving them with a broad margin of discretion in that regard.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, for the purposes of interpreting Directive 77/249, it should be noted that, contrary to what, among others, the Czech and Spanish Governments argue, the notion of `lawyer's activity' within the meaning of that directive covers not only the legal services typically provided by lawyers, such as legal advice or representing and defending a client in court, but may also cover other kinds of services, such as the authentication of signatures. The fact that those latter services are not provided by lawyers in all Member States is of no relevance in that respect.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it is necessary to recall, as the Court has held on numerous occasions, that, in order to enable services to be provided, the person providing the service may go to the Member State where the person for whom it is provided is established or else the latter may go to the State in which the person providing the service is established. Whilst the former case is explicitly mentioned in the third paragraph of Article 57 TFEU, which permits the person providing the service to pursue his activity temporarily in the Member State where the service is provided under the same conditions as are imposed by that State on its own nationals, the latter case, which fulfils the objective of making all gainful activity not covered by the free movement of goods, persons and capital subject to the freedom to provide services, is the necessary corollary thereof (see, inter alia, judgment of 24 September 2013, Demirkan, C‑221/11, EU:C:2013:583, paragraph 34).</p>

            <p>Accordingly, it is the Court's established case-law that the freedom to provide services conferred by Article 56 TFEU on Member State nationals, and thus on European Union citizens, includes `passive' freedom to provide services, namely the freedom for recipients of services to go to another Member State in order to receive a service there, without being hindered by restrictions (see, inter alia, judgment of 24 September 2013, Demirkan, C‑221/11, EU:C:2013:583, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It follows that, to the extent to which it seeks to facilitate the effective exercise by lawyers of the freedom to provide services, Directive 77/249 must be interpreted as applying both in the typical case of the lawyer travelling to a Member State other than that in which he or she is established in order to provide his or her services and in the case where that professional does not travel, namely where, as in the case in the main proceedings, it is the recipient of the service who travels outside his or her Member State of residence in order to visit another Member State and to avail of the services of a lawyer established there.</p>

            <p>In order to answer that question, it is necessary, in the first place, to bear in mind that Article 56 TFEU requires not only the elimination of all discrimination on grounds of nationality against providers of services who are established in another Member State, but also the abolition of any restriction on the freedom to provide services, even if that restriction applies without distinction to national providers of services and to those of other Member States, which is liable to prohibit, impede or render less attractive the activities of a service provider established in another Member State where it lawfully provides similar services (judgments of 18 July 2013, Citroën Belux, C‑265/12, EU:C:2013:498, paragraph 35 and the case-law cited, and of 11 June 2015, Berlington Hungary and Others, C‑98/14, EU:C:2015:386, paragraph 35).</p>

            <p>In the present case, Paragraph 53(3) of the GBG confers on notaries and courts alone the power to authenticate signatures appended to the instruments necessary for the creation or transfer of rights to property.

In addition, having regard to the case-law cited in paragraphs 34 and 35 of the present judgment, such a reservation of competence also restricts the freedom of an Austrian national, as the recipient of such a service, to travel to the Czech Republic in order to avail there of a service which cannot be used in Austria for the purposes of making an entry in the land register.</p>

In particular, each entry in a land register -- such as the Austrian land register -- alters rights, in so far as the rights of the person who has requested that entry arise only after the corresponding entry has been made therein. Maintaining the land register thus constitutes an essential component of the preventive administration of justice in the sense that it seeks to ensure proper application of the law and legal certainty of documents concluded between individuals, which are matters coming within the scope of the tasks and responsibilities of the State.</p>

            <p>It is, however, still necessary to verify whether the measure at issue in the main proceedings satisfies the requirement of proportionality within the meaning of the case-law set out in paragraphs 53 and 60 of the present judgment.</p>

            <p>In the present case, as is apparent from the observations made by the Austrian authorities during the hearing, the notary's involvement is important and necessary for the purposes of entry in the land register, since the participation of that professional is not limited to confirming the identity of a person who has appended a signature to an instrument, but also involves the notary's becoming acquainted with the content of the instrument in question in order to ensure that the proposed transaction is lawful as well as verifying that the applicant enjoys legal capacity.</p>

            <p>In those conditions, the act of reserving activities relating to the authentication of instruments for creating or transferring rights to property to a particular category of professionals in which there is public trust and over which the Member State concerned exercises particular control constitutes an appropriate measure for attaining the objectives of proper functioning of the land register system and for ensuring the legality and legal certainty of documents concluded between individuals.</p>

            <p>Moreover, it is important to bear in mind that the activity of lawyers consisting in certifying the authenticity of signatures appended to instruments is not comparable to the authentication activity carried out by notaries and that stricter provisions govern the system of authentications.</p>

            <p>In that regard, at the hearing in the present case, the Czech Government stated that, while a Czech lawyer is indeed authorised to certify the authenticity of a signature under precise conditions defined in specific legislation, it is nevertheless clear from the case-law of the Nejvyšší soud (Supreme Court, Czech Republic) that the certificate of authenticity of a signature appended by a Czech lawyer does not constitute a public instrument. Therefore, in the event of a dispute between parties, that certification will not have the same evidentiary value as authentication by a notary.</p>

            <p>It follows, according to that Member State, that, if such a signature were to be recognised in Austria for the purposes of entry in the Austrian land register, that certification, in so far as it would be considered equivalent to authentication by a notary, would have the value of a public instrument. Accordingly, it would have a different strength in Austria to what it might have even in the Czech Republic.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the act of dispensing in a general manner, for reasons relating to the freedom of lawyers to provide services, with State control functions and with an effective guarantee of control over entries in the land register would lead to disruption of the smooth functioning of the land register and of the legality and legal certainty of documents concluded between individuals.</p>

            <p>In view of the foregoing, the answer to the second question is that Article 56 TFEU must be interpreted as not precluding legislation of a Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, under which authentication of signatures appended to the instruments necessary for the creation or transfer of rights to property is reserved to notaries, and as consequently excluding the possibility of recognition in that Member State of such authentication carried out, in accordance with his or her national law, by a lawyer established in another Member State.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fifth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. The second subparagraph of Article 1(1) of Council Directive 77/249/EEC of 22 March 1977 to facilitate the effective exercise by lawyers of freedom to provide services must be interpreted as not applying to legislation of a Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, under which authentication of signatures appended to the instruments necessary for the creation or transfer of rights to property is reserved to notaries, and as consequently excluding the possibility of recognising in that Member State such authentication carried out by a lawyer established in another Member State. 2. Article 56 TFEU must be interpreted as not precluding legislation of a Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, under which authentication of signatures appended to the instruments necessary for the creation or transfer of rights to property is reserved to notaries, and as consequently excluding the possibility of recognition in that Member State of such authentication carried out, in accordance with his or her national law, by a lawyer established in another Member State.</p>
