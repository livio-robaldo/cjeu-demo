            <p>Following an exchange of correspondence that began in January 2003 and a meeting with the Irish authorities relating to compliance of the Irish system of registration tax with the principles set out in the judgments of 21 March 2002, Cura Anlagen ( C‑451/99, EU:C:2002:195), and of 15 September 2005, Commission v Denmark ( C‑464/02, EU:C:2005:546), on 27 January 2011 the Commission sent Ireland a letter of formal notice. The Commission stated in that letter that, by levying a registration tax upon the registration by an Irish resident of a motor vehicle leased or rented in another Member State, without taking account of the duration of the use of the vehicle and without the resident in question having any right to an exemption or a refund, where the vehicle was neither intended to be used essentially in Ireland on a permanent basis nor in fact used in that way, Ireland was failing to fulfil its obligations under Articles 56 to 62 TFEU.</p>

            <p>In its reply dated 26 May 2011 to the letter of formal notice, Ireland contested the alleged incompatibility of its legislation with EU law. While accepting that the application of the registration tax to hired or leased vehicles could be regarded as a potential obstacle to the freedom to provide services, the Irish authorities contended that such legislation was justified by reasons relating to the choice made by Ireland of residence as a criterion for exercising its powers of taxation, and also by reasons relating to environmental protection, the safeguarding of competition and the coherence and effectiveness of the regime governing the registration tax. Ireland stressed that a change in the system of registration tax would confer a competitive advantage on vehicle leasing undertakings established in Northern Ireland, where registration tax was lower, and would thus encourage Irish residents to use vehicles from abroad, adversely affecting the domestic trade in vehicles and causing serious tax losses.</p>

            <p>By letter of 10 January 2012, the Irish authorities informed the Commission that they were going to establish a refund system that would enable applicants who had paid the full amount of registration tax to obtain a refund of the excess tax. By letter of 10 April 2012, the Irish authorities sent the Commission the text of the Finance Act 2012, which established such a system, while explaining that the order bringing that legislation into operation still had to be adopted. The refund system entered into force in Ireland on 8 April 2013.</p>

            <p>In a letter sent to the Irish authorities on 26 September 2013, the Commission contended that the Irish system of registration tax did not take due account of the order of 29 September 2010, VAV-Autovermietung ( C‑91/10, not published, EU:C:2010:558). According to the Commission, payment of the full amount of registration tax, without taking account of the duration of the leasing contract, when its duration could be established, was disproportionate, even if a system for refunding the balance was laid down. The Commission therefore requested the Irish authorities to provide it with information on the measures that they were envisaging adopting so as to comply with that order.</p>

            <p>Following an exchange of letters and a meeting with the Irish authorities, on 11 July 2014 the Commission issued an additional letter of formal notice, repeating its position relating to the guidance resulting from the order of 29 September 2010, VAV-Autovermietung ( C‑91/10, not published, EU:C:2010:558). According to the Commission, Ireland was failing to fulfil its obligations under Articles 56 to 62 TFEU, by requiring Irish residents, upon the registration of a motor vehicle leased or rented in another Member State, to pay the full amount of the registration tax due for a permanent registration, and not an amount proportionate to the duration of the use of the vehicle in Ireland, when that duration was predetermined and limited. Furthermore, the conditions for refunding the tax paid, namely the payment of an administration charge of EUR 500, the compulsory carrying out of technical examinations and the possible loss of interest, taken together, could discourage the provision of cross-border services.</p>

            <p>In its reply dated 11 November 2014 to the letter of formal notice, Ireland stated that the system of registration tax was fair and proportionate and complied with the requirements of Article 56 TFEU. It stated in particular that the Irish legislation was very different from the Netherlands legislation at issue in the order of 29 September 2010, VAV-Autovermietung ( C‑91/10, not published, EU:C:2010:558), that a refund was obligatory when the statutory conditions were met and that it was in the process of adopting measures providing for the payment of interest on sums refunded.</p>

            <p>On 26 February 2015 the Commission adopted an additional reasoned opinion, reiterating its position expressed in its additional letter of formal notice that payment of the full amount of registration tax, even combined with a refund mechanism, was disproportionate when the duration of the use was known in advance. Furthermore, the administration charge of EUR 500 was disproportionate and, taken together with the possible loss of interest and the obligation that a technical examination be carried out, neutralised a significant part of the refund. The Commission therefore called on Ireland to comply with the additional reasoned opinion within two months of receipt thereof, which occurred on 27 February 2015.</p>

            <p>Without formally pleading that the action is inadmissible, Ireland submits that, by its conduct during the pre-litigation procedure and when the action was brought, the Commission failed to observe the principle of sincere cooperation set out in Article 4(3) TEU and the general principle of good administration set out in Article 41 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, and did not respect Ireland's rights of defence.</p>

            <p>First of all, after accepting that a refund system may be compatible with Article 56 TFEU, the Commission changed its position in 2013, relying on the order of 29 September 2010, VAV-Autovermietung ( C‑91/10, not published, EU:C:2010:558), to reject henceforth the very principle of such a refund system in the context of cross-border application of a national registration tax. That change in the Commission's position as to what it considers to be required by Article 56 TFEU occurred although there was no relevant development in the case-law and although Ireland amended its legislation a number of times in order to comply with the Commission's initial demands.</p>

            <p>Next, the application was lodged prematurely and ignores some of the changes made to the Irish legislation, in particular the payment of interest provided for by the Finance Act 2014. Ireland observes that, even before the application was lodged on 23 October 2015, the Commission had been informed that on 1 January 2016 both the implementing regulations of 2015 laying down the method of calculating interest in the event of a refund and the Finance Act 2015 providing for the reduction of the administration charge to EUR 100 would enter into force.</p>

            <p>The Commission counters by stating that it was not inconsistent and did not change its position in carrying out, in the light of the measures recently adopted by Ireland, a fresh assessment as to whether the Irish system of registration tax complied with EU law. More generally, it submits that, on expiry of the period laid down in the additional reasoned opinion, Ireland had not taken the measures necessary to bring its legislation into line with EU law. Section 135D(2)(b) of the Finance Act 1992, a provision resulting from the Finance Act 2014, merely provides for the potential subsequent adoption of rules on the payment of interest and cannot be regarded as establishing a complete or operative system for such payment. It is true that such rules were finally enacted by means of the implementing regulations of 2015, but the latter were not adopted until 17 December 2015, that is to say, well after expiry of the period laid down in the additional reasoned opinion.</p>

            <p>In the present instance, as regards the argument that during the pre-litigation procedure the Commission changed its position regarding whether a system of taxation with a subsequent refund is compatible with EU law, it is to be noted that the Commission initially complained, in both the letter of formal notice and the reasoned opinion, that Ireland had imposed on any Irish resident an obligation to pay a registration tax upon the registration of a motor vehicle leased or rented in another Member State, without taking account of the duration of the use of the vehicle and without the resident in question having any right to an exemption or a refund, where the vehicle was neither intended to be used essentially in Ireland on a permanent basis nor in fact used in that way.</p>

            <p>Following the entry into force on 8 April 2013 of a system for refunding registration tax, on 11 July 2014 the Commission issued an additional letter of formal notice, setting a fresh period for Ireland to submit its observations, before sending it, on 26 February 2015, an additional reasoned opinion founded on the same complaints as those set out in the additional letter of formal notice. The Commission took the view therein that the levying of the full amount of tax, even combined with a refund mechanism, was disproportionate if the duration of the use was known in advance. It added that the administration charge of EUR 500 was also disproportionate and, considered together with the possible loss of interest and the obligation that a technical examination be carried out, neutralised a significant part of the refund.</p>

            <p>As regards the alleged breach of the principle of sincere cooperation and the principle of good administration because of the date chosen for bringing the action, it should be recalled, first, that it is for the Commission to determine whether it is expedient to take action against a Member State and what provisions, in its view, the Member State has infringed, and to choose the time at which it will bring an action for failure to fulfil obligations; the considerations which determine that choice cannot affect the admissibility of the action (judgments of 1 June 1994, Commission v Germany, C‑317/92, EU:C:1994:212, paragraph 4; of 18 June 1998, Commission v Italy, C‑35/96, EU:C:1998:303, paragraph 27; of 1 February 2001, Commission v France, C‑333/99, EU:C:2001:73, paragraph 24; and of 8 December 2005, Commission v Luxembourg, C‑33/04, EU:C:2005:750, paragraph 66). Indeed, the Commission is entitled to decide, in its discretion, on what date it may be appropriate to bring an action and it is thus not for the Court, in principle, to review the exercise of that discretion (judgments of 10 May 1995, Commission v Germany, C‑422/92, EU:C:1995:125, paragraph 18, and of 4 March 2010, Commission v Italy, C‑297/08, EU:C:2010:115, paragraph 87).</p>

          <content eId="para_18112__content">
            <p>Secondly, in accordance with the Court's settled case-law, the question whether a Member State has failed to fulfil its obligations must be determined by reference to the situation prevailing in the Member State at the end of the period laid down in the reasoned opinion, and the Court therefore cannot take account of any subsequent changes (judgments of 19 June 2003, Commission v France, C‑161/02, EU:C:2003:367, paragraph 9; of 20 May 2010, Commission v Spain, C‑158/09, not published, EU:C:2010:292, paragraph 7; and of 28 October 2010, Commission v Lithuania, C‑350/08, EU:C:2010:642, paragraph 30).</p>

That statement must be sufficiently clear and precise to enable the defendant to prepare his defence and the Court to rule on the application. It is therefore necessary for the essential points of fact and of law on which a case is based to be indicated coherently and intelligibly in the application itself and for the form of order sought to be set out unambiguously so that the Court does not rule ultra petita or fail to rule on a complaint (judgments of 11 July 2013, Commission v Czech Republic, C‑545/10, EU:C:2013:509, paragraph 108 and the case-law cited; of 23 February 2016, Commission v Hungary, C‑179/14, EU:C:2016:108, paragraph 141; and of 22 September 2016, Commission v Czech Republic, C‑525/14, EU:C:2016:714, paragraph 16).</p>

Those complaints correspond to the complaints that were set out in the additional letter of formal notice and the additional reasoned opinion. Whilst it is true that, in the grounds of the application initiating proceedings, the Commission referred a number of times to the system of registration tax as a whole, it nevertheless conducted a separate analysis there of both the obligation to pay the full amount of registration tax and the detailed rules for its refund, and stated, in particular in paragraph 29 of the application, that those measures, in isolation and in particular when combined, constituted a restriction on the freedom to provide services.</p>

            <p>As regards, in particular, the obligation to pay the full amount of registration tax in advance, the Commission observes that it is apparent from the Court's settled case-law that, in order to be proportionate, such a tax must be calculated with due regard for the term of the contract for hire of the vehicle concerned or for the duration of the vehicle's use on the relevant road network (orders of 27 June 2006, van de Coevering, C‑242/05, EU:C:2006:430, paragraphs 31 to 33; of 22 May 2008, Ilhan, C‑42/08, not published, EU:C:2008:305, paragraphs 20 and 24; and of 29 September 2010, VAV-Autovermietung, C‑91/10, not published, EU:C:2010:558, paragraphs 20, 21, 26 and 30). The Irish scheme for refunding registration tax essentially has the aim of bringing short-term vehicle importation within a more general export refund scheme rather than of specifically ensuring that the importation of vehicles for pre-determined temporary periods of time is taxed in proportion to the duration of the importation.</p>

            <p>Despite the fact that the registration tax is calculated on the basis of the open market selling price and depends, inter alia, on the vehicle's condition and mileage, it would be possible to establish a pro-rata tax without compromising the objectives pursued by the Irish authorities, on the basis of an estimate of the open market value calculated by reference to average mileage and depreciation. The definitive fixing of the amount of registration tax would occur subsequently, at the time of export, and would give rise to a refund or an additional payment, depending on whether the open market selling price at the time of export turns out to be higher or lower than that taken into account when tax was initially charged. In the event of a higher open market value, additional tax can be enforced, in principle, against two different debtors in the case of short-term hire, namely the lessor and the lessee, and can involve, if necessary, seizure of the vehicle. Such a system, even if founded on estimates requiring subsequent adjustment, is not more unfair or unjust than a system that, as in this instance, does not involve any deduction.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, Ireland's arguments referring to practical difficulties lack coherence. If Ireland's concern were related to the risk of the lessee overstaying in Ireland, there should be no requirement for extra-territorial enforcement because the vehicle remaining in Ireland beyond the date of expiry of the lease would still be in the territory of that Member State. There is nothing preventing Ireland from requiring, at the time of the vehicle's registration, proof of the limited duration of the contract, for example by requesting a copy of the contract, and from subsequently conducting checks relating to registration and compliance with other applicable fiscal and regulatory obligations, such as, for example, the obligation to keep annual motor tax and insurance payments up to date.</p>

Taking the duration of the use into account would make it possible to avoid vehicles being subject to onerous technical examination procedures and to the considerable fees that such procedures entail.</p>

            <p>The Court's case-law has been established in the context of national systems precluding any export refund (judgments of 21 March 2002, Cura Anlagen, C‑451/99, EU:C:2002:195, and of 23 February 2006, Commission v Finland, C‑232/03, not published, EU:C:2006:128; orders of 27 June 2006, van de Coevering, C‑242/05, EU:C:2006:430, and of 22 May 2008, Ilhan, C‑42/08, not published, EU:C:2008:305; judgment of 26 April 2012, van Putten, C‑578/10 to C‑580/10, EU:C:2012:246) or national systems which, although providing for such a refund, involved calculation of the amount of the refund on the basis of the duration of the use of the vehicle in the State and excluded the payment of interest (order of 29 September 2010, VAV-Autovermietung, C‑91/10, not published, EU:C:2010:558).</p>

On the contrary, it has recognised, in the order of 27 June 2006, van de Coevering ( C‑242/05, EU:C:2006:430), and in the judgment of 26 April 2012, van Putten ( C‑578/10 to C‑580/10, EU:C:2012:246), that, in the case of the taxation of leased or rented vehicles, an appropriately structured refund system may comply with the principle of proportionality.</p>

            <p>Also, unlike the cases which gave rise to the decisions referred to in paragraph 54 of the present judgment, the basis for assessment of the registration tax depends not on the time for which the vehicle concerned is in Ireland but on its condition and mileage. Thus, it is not possible to predict at the time of import the correct level of export refund and to calculate ex ante the registration tax actually payable in each case.</p>

            <p>Secondly, amendment of the system of registration tax to the effect recommended by the Commission would entail substantial amendment of the detailed rules for levying that tax and would result, in particular, in the open market selling price of the vehicle being replaced, as the basis for calculation of the tax, by the duration of its use on the Irish road network or by its presence in Ireland.</p>

            <p>First of all, although vehicle taxation is not harmonised and the Member States retain their freedom of action in that regard, the Commission seeks, by the present proceedings, to harmonise the bases for calculating registration taxes in the Member States. Next, the basis of calculation chosen by Ireland has the object and effect that vehicle taxation reflects the vehicles' actual use. It is thus consistent with the Court's case-law and the introduction of a method of ex ante calculation, on the basis of anticipated rather than actual use, would not be coherent. The refund, with interest, of excess registration tax upon export seeks to ensure that the taxpayer pays exactly the right amount of tax and is no worse off financially from having paid the full amount of tax in advance. Finally, Article 56 TFEU does not force the Member States to levy the same amount of tax on persons who make heavy use of their vehicle and those who make very little use of it, on the pretext that the duration of the lease is the same, and the fact that it is theoretically possible to replace taking account of the actual use and condition of a vehicle upon export with an exemption established in advance based on duration of use is in this regard irrelevant, as is the existence in other Member States of any tax systems founded on duration of use.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, amendment of the system of registration tax to the effect recommended by the Commission would prevent the objectives pursued by that tax from being achieved in Ireland. Those objectives are, first of all, to compensate for the external effects of vehicle use, such as the costs for society in terms of road infrastructure, traffic control, emergency services and registration services, and to compensate for the environmental effects in terms of air and noise pollution. Also, the registration tax is intended to be proportionate to the vehicle's market value and, finally, it encourages the purchase of environmentally-friendly vehicles.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, establishment of the system proposed by the Commission, which involves an initial estimate followed by a balancing payment upon export, would entail risks of loss of tax revenue and would also result in very great practical difficulties since, while subjecting vehicles to the same technical examinations, it would give rise to an additional administrative burden and to costs for the cross-border leasing of vehicles.</p>

            <p>Fifthly, Ireland observes that there is no duty to register a vehicle in Ireland for 30 days, the effect of this being that the registration tax cannot apply where the term of the rental is particularly short. It adds that, in any event, the tax is relatively low because the initial amount is 2.5 times -- and not, as the Commission incorrectly claims, 11 times -- the amount ultimately due. Moreover, in order to assess the effect of the registration tax, it is not appropriate to take as a basis the class of the most polluting vehicles as</p>

            <p>Sixthly, Ireland observes that setting the amount of the administration charge at EUR 500 was due to the necessity to recoup some of the significant initial costs of setting up the export refund system and adds that that amount has been reduced to EUR 100. The Court has held, as set out in the judgment of 7 April 2011, Tatu ( C‑402/09, EU:C:2011:219), that reasonable administrative fees may be sought for provision of a service, as long as they do not represent an excessive cost to the consumer and they do not constitute an unjustified obstacle to accessing the service, without, however, ruling itself that the cost to be borne by the taxpayer is not to exceed the cost of the operations in connection with the inspection.</p>

It therefore follows from section 135D(2)(b) that, even though the principle that interest is to be paid if part of the registration tax is refunded could be regarded as laid down in essence, that provision could not in itself produce legal effects enabling the excess registration tax to be refunded with interest and that actual application of the mechanism for payment of interest required the Irish authorities to adopt implementing measures.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, as Ireland moreover acknowledges, the Court ruled in the order of 29 September 2010, VAV-Autovermietung ( C‑91/10, not published, EU:C:2010:558), on the compliance with EU law of national legislation under which a person residing or established in one Member State who uses in that Member State a motor vehicle registered and hired in another Member State must, upon the first use of that vehicle on the road network of the first Member State, pay the full amount of a tax the balance of which, calculated according to the duration of the use of the vehicle on that network, is reimbursed, without interest, after that use has ended.

Since the duration of their use in Ireland is limited and known in advance, a less restrictive measure could consist in levying, at the time of their registration, a registration tax proportionate to the duration of that use.</p>

            <p>Ireland submits, however, that establishment of a system founded on the initial payment of a registration tax proportionate to the duration of use envisaged in Ireland, followed by a balancing payment upon export, would entail the risk of losses of tax revenue and would result in very great practical difficulties, because, in particular, it is not possible to predict, at the time of import, what the exact amount of the export refund will be and because the actual use of the vehicle could differ considerably from the planned use. If the registration tax paid initially proves insufficient but the vehicle has already been exported outside Ireland, the lessor and the owner of the vehicle could fall outside Ireland's geographic tax jurisdiction. Ireland adds that, since establishment of the system proposed by the Commission would require the same technical examination to be carried out as that in force and, subsequently, would give rise to the same administrative costs, it is to be feared that, where additional registration tax is payable, certain taxpayers will seek to avoid those costs and the additional registration tax, by not reporting an extension of the duration of the rental or leasing contract to the Irish authorities.</p>

Also, administrative disadvantages are not of themselves sufficient to justify a barrier to the freedom to provide services (see, to that effect, judgments of 4 March 2004, Commission v France, C‑334/02, EU:C:2004:129, paragraph 29; of 14 September 2006, Centro di Musicologia Walter Stauffer, C‑386/04, EU:C:2006:568, paragraph 48; of 27 November 2008, Papillon, C‑418/07, EU:C:2008:659, paragraph 54; and of 9 October 2014, van Caster, C‑326/12, EU:C:2014:2269, paragraph 56).</p>

            <p>Next, it must be pointed out that both the calculation of the registration tax to be paid and that of the registration tax to be refunded, as prescribed by the Finance Act 1992, are based on factors that are partly standardised.

Furthermore, other measures, such as an obligation to declare any extension of the rental or leasing contract or registration limited to the planned period of use, could be envisaged.</p>
