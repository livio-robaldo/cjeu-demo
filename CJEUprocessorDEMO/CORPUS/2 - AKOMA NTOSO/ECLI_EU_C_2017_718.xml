Aviva submitted that that should be the case and that, therefore, the members of the EEIG established in Poland, which are companies carrying on an economic activity in the area of insurance, had to be exempted from the obligation to charge and to declare VAT due on the costs passed on by the EEIG.</p>

            <p>By decision of 14 March 2013, the Minister of Finance considered that Aviva's position was incorrect. It found that the condition to which the exemption under Article 43(1)(21) of the Law on VAT is subject, that the conditions of competition must not be disturbed, had not been fulfilled. According to the Minister of Finance, the application of an exemption to an independent group of persons ( `IGP') places it in a privileged position on the market as compared with other entities engaged in the same transactions. It therefore considered that, where entities which are not part of an IGP and which carry on a similar, taxed activity operate on the market in question, it is appropriate to refuse that exemption on the ground that it is liable to infringe the competition rules.</p>

            <p>Aviva brought an action before the Wojewódzki Sąd Administracyjny w Warszawie (Regional Administrative Court, Warsaw, Poland), seeking, inter alia, annulment of that decision of the Minister of Finance. It claimed that that decision, according to which the services purchased by Aviva from the EEIG could not benefit from the exemption from VAT at issue, amounted to an infringement of Article 43(1)(21) of the Law on VAT.</p>

            <p>By judgment of 30 December 2013, the Wojewódzki Sąd Administracyjny w Warszawie (Regional Administrative Court, Warsaw) annulled the decision of the Minister of Finance of 14 March 2013. It held that the proposed EEIG satisfied all of the conditions permitting the application of the exemption under Article 43(1)(21) of the Law on VAT. That court took the view that distortions of competition could be raised only if there existed, on the market for ancillary services, entities other than the IGP concerned which were ready to offer services similar to those provided by that IGP and if, moreover, the current purchasers of the services, who are members of that IGP, were interested in purchasing those services from an entity outside of that group. According to that court, it would be difficult to find on the market an economic entity which would provide, as a shared-services centre, services to entities established in 12 Member States, without making profits and by operating exclusively within the structure of the group at issue in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>However, according to settled case-law, it is necessary, when interpreting a provision of EU law, to consider not only its wording but also the context in which it occurs and the objectives pursued by the rules of which it is part (judgments of 26 April 2012, Able UK, C‑225/11, EU:C:2012:252, paragraph 22, and of 4 April 2017, Fahimian, C‑544/15, EU:C:2017:255, paragraph 30 and the case law cited).</p>

            <p>As regards the context of Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112, it should be pointed out that that provision is included in Chapter 2, entitled `Exemptions for certain activities in the public interest', of Title IX of that directive. That heading indicates that the exemption provided for in that provision refers only to those IGPs whose members carry on activities in the public interest.</p>

            <p>That interpretation is also confirmed by the structure of Title IX of that directive relating to `Exemptions'. Within Directive 2006/112, Article 132(1)(f) is included, not in Chapter 1, entitled `General Provisions', of that title, but in Chapter 2. Moreover, in that title, a distinction is made between Chapter 2, entitled `Exemptions for certain activities in the public interest', and Chapter 3, entitled `Exemptions for other activities', a distinction which indicates that the rules laid down in Chapter 2 for certain activities in the public interest do not apply to the other activities referred to in Chapter 3.</p>

            <p>Chapter 3 includes, in Article 135(1)(a), an exemption for `insurance and reinsurance transactions'. It is thus clear from the general scheme of Directive 2006/112 that the exemption provided for in Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112 does not apply to insurance and reinsurance transactions and that, accordingly, the services provided by IGPs whose members are active in the area of insurance and reinsurance do not come within that exemption.</p>

            <p>As regards the aim of Article 132(1)(f), within Directive 2006/112, it is necessary to recall the purpose of all of the provisions of Article 132 of that directive, which is to exempt from VAT certain activities in the public interest with a view to facilitating access to certain services and the supply of certain goods by avoiding the increased costs that would result if they were subject to VAT (judgment of 5 October 2016, TMD, C‑412/15, EU:C:2016:738, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Thus, the services provided by an IGP come within the exemption provided for in Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112 where the provision of those services contributes directly to the exercise of activities in the public interest referred to in Article 132 of that directive (see, by analogy, judgment of 5 October 2016, TMD, C‑412/15, EU:C:2016:738, paragraphs 31 to 33).</p>

            <p>In addition, it must be recalled that the scope of the exemptions referred to in Article 132 of Directive 2006/112 is to be interpreted strictly, since they constitute exceptions to the general principle that VAT is to be levied on all services supplied for consideration by a taxable person (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 October 2016, TMD, C‑412/15, EU:C:2016:738, paragraph 34 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It follows, therefore, that the supply of services which do not contribute directly to the exercise of activities in the public interest referred to in Article 132, but to the exercise of other exempt activities, in particular those referred to in Article 135 of that directive, cannot come under the exemption provided for in Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112 should be interpreted to the effect that the exemption provided for in that provision relates only to IGPs whose members carry on activities in the public interest referred to in that article. Therefore, services provided by IGPs, whose members carry on an economic activity in the area of insurance, which does not constitute an activity in the public interest, are not entitled to that exemption.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be pointed out that, unlike what it is doing in the present case, the Court, in the judgment of 20 November 2003, Taksatorringen ( C‑8/01, EU:C:2003:621), did not resolve the question whether the exemption provided for in Article 13A(1)(f) of the Sixth Directive (corresponding to Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112) was limited to the services provided by an IGP whose members carried on activities in the public interest.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should, however, be noted that national authorities could not reopen tax periods which have been definitively closed, on the basis of Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112, as interpreted in paragraph 32 above (see, by analogy, judgments of 6 October 2009, Asturcom Telecomunicaciones, C‑40/08, EU:C:2009:615, paragraph 37, and of 21 December 2016, Gutiérrez Naranjo and Others, C‑154/15, C‑307/15 and C‑308/15, EU:C:2016:980, paragraph 68).</p>

            <p>As regards tax periods which have not yet been definitively closed, it must be recalled that, according to settled case-law, a directive cannot of itself impose obligations on an individual and cannot therefore be relied on as such against that individual (see, inter alia, judgment of 19 April 2016, DI, C‑441/14, EU:C:2016:278, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited). Thus, national authorities cannot rely on Article 132(1)(f) of Directive 2006/112, as interpreted in paragraph 32 above, in order to withhold that exemption from IGPs made up of entities such as insurance companies and, therefore, in order to refuse to exempt the supply of services by those IGPs from VAT.</p>
