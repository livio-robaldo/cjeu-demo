            <p>On 9 and 10 November 2004, the Commission conducted unannounced inspections at the premises of various companies and national industry associations operating in the bathroom fittings and fixtures sector. Between 15 November 2005 and 16 May 2006, the Commission sent requests for information to those companies and associations, including the appellants. It then, on 26 March 2007, adopted a statement of objections, which was also notified to the appellants.</p>

That infringement, in which 17 undertakings had allegedly participated, was said to have taken place over various periods between 16 October 1992 and 9 November 2004 and to have taken the form of anticompetitive agreements or concerted practices covering the territory of Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria. According to the decision at issue, the products covered by the cartel were bathroom fittings and fixtures belonging to the following three product sub-groups: taps and fittings, shower enclosures and accessories, and ceramic sanitary ware (ceramics).</p>

            <p>As regards the appellants' participation in the infringement identified, first, the Commission noted that, despite being primarily manufacturers of taps and fittings throughout the period of the infringement, they had nevertheless been aware of the entire product scope of the infringement, because of their participation in cartel meetings of various umbrella associations of which they were members. Secondly, so far as concerns the geographic scope of the cartel, the Commission found that the appellants had participated in meetings in five of the six Member States in which an infringement had been found up to 2002, namely Belgium, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria. As regards France, the Commission acknowledged that, notwithstanding the fact that there was an infringement as from 2002, the appellants ceased to participate in the national industry association concerned in that year. However, in the light of a variety of information and evidence, the Commission found that the appellants could reasonably have foreseen that the anticompetitive practices which characterised the infringement identified were having effects in France. Accordingly, the Commission concluded that the appellants could not have been unaware of the general scope and the essential characteristics of the infringement at issue.</p>

The application of that method means, therefore, that the criteria of the duration and gravity of infringements committed by those undertakings, to which Article 23(3) of Regulation No 1/2003 refers, are not taken into account in an appropriate manner. Thus, the application of those guidelines undermines, even more than the Guidelines on the method of setting fines imposed pursuant to Article 15(2) of Regulation No 17 and Article 65(5) [CS] ( OJ 1998 C 9, p. 3, `the 1998 Guidelines'), the principle that penalties must be specific to the offender.</p>

It is, they maintain, also apparent from the judgment of 16 June 2011, Putters International v Commission ( T‑211/08, EU:T:2011:289), and from the Commission Decision of 28 March 2012 relating to a proceeding under Article 101 TFEU and Article 53 of the EEA Agreement (Case COMP/39.452 -- Mountings for windows and window doors) ( `the Decision of 28 March 2012'), that when the Commission has made an error in the exercise of its power to set the amount of the fine, the General Court is itself obliged, in the context of its unlimited jurisdiction, to carry out an autonomous assessment of the fine, based on the particular circumstances of the case.</p>

            <p>As the General Court correctly noted in paragraph 87 of the judgment under appeal, it is apparent from the settled case-law of the Court of Justice that the fact that, owing to the application of the ceiling of 10% of turnover referred to in the second subparagraph of Article 23(2) of Regulation No 1/2003, certain factors such as the gravity and duration of the infringement are not actually reflected in the amount of the fine imposed is merely a consequence of the application of that upper limit to the final amount (see, in particular, judgments of 28 June 2005, Dansk Rørindustri and Others v Commission, C‑189/02 P, C‑202/02 P, C‑205/02 P to C‑208/02 P and C‑213/02 P, EU:C:2005:408, paragraph 279, and of 12 July 2012, Cetarsa v Commission, C‑181/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:455, paragraph 81).</p>

          <content eId="para_10412__content">
            <p>That upper limit seeks to prevent fines being imposed which it is foreseeable that the undertakings, owing to their size, as determined, albeit approximately and imperfectly, by their total turnover, will not be able to pay (judgments of 28 June 2005, Dansk Rørindustri and Others v Commission, C‑189/02 P, C‑202/02 P, C‑205/02 P to C‑208/02 P and C‑213/02 P, EU:C:2005:408, paragraph 280, and of 12 July 2012, Cetarsa v Commission, C‑181/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:455, paragraph 82).</p>

            <p>The limit is therefore one which is uniformly applicable to all undertakings and arrived at according to the size of each of them, and seeks to ensure that the fines are not excessive or disproportionate. That upper limit thus has a distinct and autonomous objective by comparison with the criteria of gravity and duration of the infringement (judgments of 28 June 2005, Dansk Rørindustri and Others v Commission, C‑189/02 P, C‑202/02 P, C‑205/02 P to C‑208/02 P and C‑213/02 P, EU:C:2005:408, paragraphs 281 and 282, and of 12 July 2012, Cetarsa v Commission, C‑181/11 P, not published, EU:C:2012:455, paragraph 83).</p>

            <p>It follows that both the arguments to the effect that insufficient account was taken of the gravity and duration of the infringements, owing to the application of the upper limit provided for in Article 23(2) of Regulation No 1/2003, and those to the effect that that limit is, on account of the 2006 Guidelines and unlike what happens under the 1998 Guidelines, regularly exceeded in the case of non-diversified `mono-product' undertakings, must be rejected as unfounded.</p>

            <p>Even on the assumption that, when the fines to be imposed on undertakings offering few products are being set, the intermediate amounts do more frequently exceed the upper limit laid down in Article 23(2) of Regulation No 1/2003 if the 2006 Guidelines are applied by the Commission than under the 1998 Guidelines, that circumstance cannot call into question the legality of the application of that limit referred to by the Court of Justice, as regards both fines that are imposed under the former guidelines and those imposed under the latter.</p>

            <p>The General Court cannot, therefore, be criticised for having adopted, in paragraph 87 of the judgment under appeal, the Commission's assessment regarding the amount of the fine imposed on the appellants, which was based on the 2006 Guidelines, without carrying out an autonomous assessment of that fine.</p>

            <p>By their second ground of appeal, the appellants claim that the General Court's explanations with regard to the principle that penalties must be specific to the offender are vitiated by a failure to state reasons. Notwithstanding the fact that, in paragraph 80 et seq., and in particular in paragraph 87, of the judgment under appeal, the General Court examined certain arguments put forward by the appellants in relation to that issue, it did not mention those relating to the judgment of 16 June 2011, Putters International v Commission ( T‑211/08, EU:T:2011:289), in particular the considerations in paragraph 75 of that judgment, despite the importance which the appellants attached to those arguments. Similarly, the judgment under appeal did not refer to the relevant grounds of the Decision of 28 March 2012, with the result that the General Court did not rule on those points.</p>

            <p>It should be borne in mind that, in accordance with the settled case-law of the Court, the General Court's obligation to state reasons does not require it to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one by one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case; the reasoning may therefore be implicit, on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why the General Court has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (see, to that effect, in particular, judgments of 7 January 2004, Aalborg Portland and Others v Commission, C‑204/00 P, C‑205/00 P, C‑211/00 P, C‑213/00 P, C‑217/00 P and C‑219/00 P, EU:C:2004:6, paragraph 372, and of 9 September 2008, FIAMM and Others v Council and Commission, C‑120/06 P and C‑121/06 P, EU:C:2008:476, paragraph 96).</p>

            <p>In particular, the obligation to state the reasons for its judgments does not in principle extend to requiring the General Court to justify the approach taken in one case as against that taken in another case before it, or, still less, as against a decision taken by the Commission in another case (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 July 2013, Team Relocations and Others v Commission, C‑444/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:464, paragraph 66, and order of 4 September 2014, Metropolis Inmobiliarias y Restauraciones v OHIM, C‑509/13 P, not published, EU:C:2014:2173, paragraph 51).</p>

            <p>The appellants claim, in particular, that, as is apparent from paragraph 104 of the judgment under appeal, it is common ground that the Commission has on a number of occasions infringed the procedural rules by disclosing their business secrets to other undertakings. They maintain that, in paragraphs 102 to 119 of that judgment, the General Court assessed the Commission's observance of the principle of protection of legitimate expectations in a very formalistic way, disregarding the essential nature of the appellants' expectations of the Commission's services in the context of the application of the 2002 Leniency Notice.</p>

            <p>In the appellants' submission, undertakings which cooperate should be able to rely on the Commission's assurances when these are given in a consistent manner by the agents responsible in the team dealing with the case. To hold, as the General Court did in paragraph 115 of the judgment under appeal, that such assurances do not give rise to such a legitimate expectation because they do not come from the competent service would, according to the appellants, run counter to the general interest objective of punishment of infringements and be in breach of the principle of protection of legitimate expectations.</p>

            <p>It must be noted that, in paragraphs 110 to 116 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court considered whether the Commission had breached the principle of protection of legitimate expectations when it declined to grant the appellants a reduction in the amount of the fine imposed on them.</p>

            <p>In that regard, the General Court correctly pointed out, in paragraph 111 of the judgment under appeal, that it is apparent from the settled case-law of the Court that the right to claim the protection of legitimate expectations presupposes that three cumulative conditions are satisfied, including the condition that precise, unconditional and consistent assurances must have been given by the EU administration (see, to that effect, judgments of 18 July 2007, AER v Karatzoglou, C‑213/06 P, EU:C:2007:453, paragraph 33, and of 16 December 2008, Masdar (UK) v Commission, C‑47/07 P, EU:C:2008:726, paragraph 81). The General Court went on, in paragraphs 113 to 116 of the judgment under appeal, to hold that those three conditions were not satisfied in the present case.</p>
