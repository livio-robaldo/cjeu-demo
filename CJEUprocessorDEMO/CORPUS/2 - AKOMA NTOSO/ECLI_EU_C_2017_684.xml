Therefore, the grant of a residence permit to a national of a Member State is to be regarded, not as a measure giving rise to rights, but as a measure by a Member State serving to prove the individual position of a national of another Member State with regard to provisions of European Union law (judgment of 21 July 2011, Dias, C‑325/09, EU:C:2011:498, paragraph 48 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Consequently, nothing in the documents before the Court permits the conclusion that Directive 2004/38 precludes a return decision such as that at issue in the main proceedings from being adopted by the same authorities and according to the same procedure as a decision to return a third-country national staying illegally referred to in Article 6(1) of Directive 2008/115.</p>

            <p>In view of the above, the answer to the second and third questions is that Directives 2004/38 and 2008/115 do not preclude a decision to return an EU citizen, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, from being adopted by the same authorities and according to the same procedure as a decision to return a third-country national staying illegally referred to in Article 6(1) of Directive 2008/115, provided that the transposition measures of Directive 2004/38 which are more favourable to that EU citizen are applied.</p>

            </tblock>
            <p>57 By its fourth question, the referring court asks whether the principle of effectiveness precludes a legal practice according to which a national of a Member State who is subject to a return order in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings may not rely, in support of an action against that order, on the unlawfulness of the exclusion order previously adopted against him.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it is apparent from the Court's settled case-law that, in the absence of EU rules, the Member States are responsible for designating the courts having jurisdiction and for determining the rules of procedure governing actions for safeguarding rights which individuals derive from European Union law. However, those rules must not be such as to render virtually impossible or excessively difficult the exercise of rights conferred by EU law (judgments of 29 April 2004, Orfanopoulos and Oliveri, C‑482/01 and C‑493/01, EU:C:2004:262, paragraph 80 and of 13 March 2014, Global Trans Lodzhistik, C‑29/13 and C‑30/13, EU:C:2014:140, paragraph 33).</p>

            <p>EU law in no way precludes national legislation from providing that it is not possible to rely, against an individual measure, such as a return decision, on the unlawfulness of an exclusion order which has become final, either because the time limit for bringing an action against that order expired, or because the action brought against it was dismissed.</p>

            <p>As the Court has held on several occasions, it is compatible with EU law to lay down reasonable time limits for bringing proceedings in the interests of legal certainty, which protects both the individual and the administrative authority concerned (judgment of 17 November 2016, Stadt Wiener Neustad, C‑348/15, EU:C:2016:882, paragraph 41 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It is apparent from the order for reference that, in the main proceedings, Mr Petrea claims that the exclusion order of 30 October 2011, on the basis of which the removal order of 14 October 2014 was made, was not notified to him under conditions which satisfy the requirements of Article 30 of Directive 2004/38, namely in such a way that he is `able to comprehend its content and the implications for [him]'. In such a case, the principle of effectiveness precludes the conclusion that the time limit for bringing an action against the first order had expired, and the unlawfulness of that order could still be raised in support of the action against the second order.</p>

            <p>In this case, it seems to result from order for reference that Mr Petrea was aware of the order of 30 October 2011, that he complied with it and that, prior to its adoption, he received an information bulletin for foreigners subject to exclusion, informing him, in a language he understood, of his rights and redress available to him, and of the possibility of requesting a written or oral translation of the main parts of the return decision. It seems moreover that the person concerned declared in writing that he waived all legal remedies against the order of 30 October 2011.</p>

            <p>66 First of all, it should be noted that, in the context of the fifth question, the referring court refers to Article 32 of Directive 2004/38, regarding the temporal effects of an exclusion order, although it is clearly apparent from the wording of its question that it concerns Article 30 of that directive, regarding the notifications of decisions taken under Article 27(1) thereof.</p>

          <content eId="para_17657__content">
            <p>Consequently, it must be considered that, by its fifth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 30 of Directive 2004/38 requires a decision adopted under Article 27(1) of that directive to be notified to the person concerned in a language he understands, although he did not bring an application to that effect.</p>

            <p>It should, first of all, be noted that such a requirement does not derive from the wording of Article 30(1) of that directive, which provides, more generally, that the persons concerned are to be notified in writing of any decision taken under Article 27(1) `in such a way that they are able to comprehend its content and the implications'.</p>

            <p>Next, it follows from the preparatory works to Directive 2004/38, in particular from the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and of the Council on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States [COM(2001) 257 final], that Article 30(1) of Directive 2004/38 does not mean that the removal order is to be translated into the language of the person concerned, but requires by contrast that the Member States take the necessary measures to ensure that the latter understands the content and implications of that decision, in accordance with the Court's findings in the judgment of 18 May 1982, Adoui and Cornuaille ( 115/81 and 116/81, EU:C:1982:183, paragraph 13).</p>

            <p>Finally, it should be noted, concerning return decisions adopted against third-country nationals, that Article 12(2) of Directive 2008/115 provides that the Member States are to provide, upon request, a written or oral translation of the main elements of decisions related to return, including information on the available legal remedies in a language the third-country national understands or may reasonably be presumed to understand.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Directive 2004/38/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 29 April 2004 on the right of citizens of the Union and their family members to move and reside freely within the territory of the Member States amending Regulation (EEC) No 1612/68 and repealing Directives 64/221/EEC, 68/360/EEC, 72/194/EEC, 73/148/EEC, 75/34/EEC, 75/35/EEC, 90/364/EEC, 90/365/EEC and 93/96/EEC and the protection of legitimate expectations do not preclude a Member State from, first, withdrawing a registration certificate wrongly issued to an EU citizen who was still subject to an exclusion order, and, secondly, adopting a removal order against him based on the sole finding that the exclusion order was still valid. 2. Directive 2004/38 and Directive 2008/115/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 December 2008 on common standards and procedures in Member States for returning illegally staying third-country nationals do not preclude a decision to return an EU citizen, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, from being adopted by the same authorities and according to the same procedure as a decision to return a third-country national staying illegally referred to in Article 6(1) of Directive 2008/115, provided that the transposition measures of Directive 2004/38 which are more favourable to that EU citizen are applied. 3. The principle of effectiveness does not preclude a legal practice according to which a national of a Member State who is subject to a return order in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings may not rely, in support of an action against that order, on the unlawfulness of the exclusion order previously adopted against him, in so far as the person concerned had effectively the possibility to contest that latter order in good time in the light of the provisions of Directive 2004/38. 4. Article 30 of Directive 2004/38 requires the Member States to take every appropriate measure with a view to ensuring that the person concerned understands the content and implications of a decision adopted under Article 27(1) of that directive but that it does not require that decision to be notified to him in a language he understands or which it is reasonable to assume he understands, although he did not bring an application to that effect.</p>
