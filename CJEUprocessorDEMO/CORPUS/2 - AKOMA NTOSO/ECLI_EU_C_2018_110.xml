Paragraph 2 shall not apply if the taxpayer can demonstrate that: a. there are predominantly sound business reasons for the loan and for the associated legal transaction; or b. ultimately, a profit tax or income tax which, in accordance with the Netherlands criteria, is reasonable is levied on the interest of the person to whom interest is payable, in law or fact, directly or indirectly, and that there is no offsetting of losses or charges of another kind for the years preceding that in which the loan is taken out with the result that, ultimately, no tax is payable on the interest according to the criteria of reasonableness referred to, except where it is plausible that the loan was taken out with a view to offsetting losses or charges of another kind which arose during the year itself or will arise in the short term.'</p>

            <p>The company X BV incorporated under Netherlands law is part of a Swedish group, which also includes an Italian company. In order to purchase shares in the latter, which were held by third parties, X BV set up another Italian company, to which it contributed capital in the amount of EUR 237312000. That contribution was financed by means of a loan to X BV from a Swedish company in the same group. Under that loan, in 2004 X BV owed the lending company the sum of EUR 6503261 in respect of interest. That interest was deducted by X BV in its corporation tax return for 2004. Nonetheless, the tax authorities considered that Article 10a(2)(b) of the Law on corporation tax precluded that deduction, and they issued a notice of assessment to X BV which the latter seeks to have annulled in the Netherlands courts.</p>

            <p>X NV, a company incorporated under Netherlands law, has an indirect subsidiary established in the United Kingdom. In its corporation tax returns for 2008 and 2009, X NV sought to deduct as an expense the loss on its shareholdings resulting from fluctuations in the exchange rate. Pursuant to Article 13(1) of the Law on corporation tax, according to which neither gains made nor losses incurred by reason of shareholdings are taken into account for the purposes of determining the profit, the tax authorities refused to allow that deduction.</p>

            <p>Article 49 TFEU requires the elimination of restrictions on freedom of establishment of nationals of a Member State in the territory of another Member State. That freedom includes, for companies established in accordance with the legislation of a Member State and having their registered office, central administration or principal place of business within the European Union -- which Article 54 TFEU treats in the same way as natural persons who are nationals of Member States, for the purposes of exercising freedom of establishment -- the right to exercise their activity in other Member States through a subsidiary, branch or agency (see, to that effect, judgments of 21 May 2015, Verder LabTec, C‑657/13, EU:C:2015:331, paragraph 32, and of 2 September 2015, Groupe Steria, C‑386/14, EU:C:2015:524, paragraph 14).</p>

            <p>Although, according to their wording, the provisions on freedom of establishment are aimed at ensuring the benefit of national treatment in the host Member State, they also prohibit the Member State of origin from hindering the establishment in another Member State of one of its nationals or of a company incorporated in accordance with its legislation.</p>

            <p>However, a difference in treatment stemming from a Member State's legislation to the detriment of companies exercising their freedom of establishment does not constitute an obstacle to that freedom if it relates to situations which are not objectively comparable or is justified by an overriding reason in the public interest and proportionate to that objective (see, to that effect, judgments of 12 December 2006, Test Claimants in the FII Group Litigation, C‑446/04, EU:C:2006:774, paragraph 167, and 25 February 2010, X Holding, C‑337/08, EU:C:2010:89, paragraph 20).</p>

            <p>The Court has had occasion, in the judgment of 25 February 2010, X Holding ( C‑337/08, EU:C:2010:89), to rule on the compatibility with EU law of a Member State's tax legislation, such as the Netherlands tax legislation, which reserves to resident parent companies and their resident subsidiaries the possibility of being subject to a tax integration scheme, that is to say to have tax levied on them as if they were a single tax entity. Such a scheme constitutes an advantage for the companies concerned in so far as it allows, in particular, for the profits and losses of the companies constituting the tax entity to be consolidated at the level of the parent company and for the transactions carried out within that tax entity to remain neutral for tax purposes.</p>

            <p>In paragraph 19 of that judgment, the Court held that the exclusion of such an advantage for a parent company which owns a subsidiary established in another Member State is liable to render less attractive the exercise by that parent company of its freedom of establishment by deterring it from setting up subsidiaries in other Member States.</p>

            <p>The Court nonetheless decided, in paragraph 43 of that judgment, that that difference in treatment was justified in view of the need to safeguard the allocation of the power to impose taxes between the Member States and that the restriction on the freedom of establishment stemming therefrom was proportionate to that objective.</p>

            <p>It cannot, however, be inferred from the judgment of 25 February 2010, X Holding ( C-337/08, EU:C:2010:89) that any difference in treatment between companies belonging to a tax-integrated group, on the one hand, and companies not belonging to such a group, on the other, is compatible with Article 49 TFEU. As regards tax advantages other than the transfer of losses within the tax-integrated group, a separate assessment must, therefore, be made as to whether a Member State may reserve those advantages to companies belonging to a tax-integrated group and consequently exclude them in cross-border situations (see, to that effect, judgment of 2 September 2015, Groupe Steria, C‑386/14, EU:C:2015:524, paragraphs 27 and 28).</p>

The referring court asks the Court of Justice, in essence, whether Article 49 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding those differences in treatment.</p>

            <p>Under Article 10a(2)(b) of the Law on corporation tax, interest in respect of loans taken out with a related entity is not deductible from taxable profit if that loan relates to a capital contribution, in particular in the form of the purchase of shares in a related entity.

            <p>Since, according to the referring court, a capital contribution is not apparent in a single tax entity, Article 10a(2)(b) of the Law on corporation tax does not apply to a company which borrows from a related entity in order to make a capital contribution by purchasing shares in its subsidiary with which it forms a single tax entity. In that situation, the company is, therefore, able to deduct from its taxable profits the interest in respect of its loan without having to fulfil the conditions listed in Article 10(3) of that law.</p>

            <p>In the present case, the difference in treatment at issue stems from the combination of Article 10a(2)(b) and Article 15 of the Law on corporation tax. However, the purpose of those provisions is different. Whereas Article 10a(2)(b) of that law seeks to prevent the Netherlands tax base being eroded by contrived intra-group financial arrangements, Article 15 of the law allows the profits and losses of the companies constituting the single tax entity to be consolidated at the level of the parent company and the transactions carried out within the group to remain neutral for tax purposes. According to the referring court, one of the consequences of the single tax entity scheme is that the association between the loan and the capital contribution which determines whether Article 10a(2)(b) of the Law on corporation tax applies disappears because of consolidation.</p>

            <p>First, the Court must assess whether such a difference in treatment may be justified by the need to safeguard the allocation of the power to impose taxes between the Member States. The Court has held, in the judgment of 25 February 2010, X Holding ( C‑337/08, EU:C:2010:89), as is apparent from paragraph 23 of the present judgment, that consolidation at the parent-company level for the profits and losses of the companies constituting a single tax entity represents an advantage which may justifiably be reserved to resident companies in view of the need to safeguard the allocation of the power to impose taxes between the Member States.</p>

          <content eId="para_6659__content">
            <p>However, the advantage which X BV claims in the present case may not be confused with the advantage provided by consolidation within a single tax entity. The main proceedings concern the possibility of deducting interest charges, not the general offsetting of costs and gains specific to a single tax entity. Far from reserving that possibility of deducting interest to single tax entities, Netherlands law affords that possibility to any company and restricts it only in the particular case and conditions laid down in Article 10a(2)(b) of the Law on corporation tax. In avoiding that restriction, a parent company which together with its subsidiary forms a single tax entity does not, therefore, obtain an advantage specifically linked to the tax scheme of the single tax entity.</p>

            <p>That is true all the more so since the application of Article 10a(2)(b) of the Law on corporation tax seems not to depend on the place of taxation of the income comprising the interest paid and, therefore, on ascertaining which State benefits from that taxation, a factor which the Netherlands Government has not indeed addressed.</p>

            <p>Secondly, the referring court asks whether justification could be derived from the need to ensure the coherence of the Netherlands tax system. The Court accepts that such a justification constitutes an overriding reason in the public interest, provided that a direct link is established between the tax advantage concerned and the offsetting of that advantage by a particular tax levy, the direct nature of that link falling to be examined in the light of the objective pursued by the rules in question (judgment of 2 September 2015, Groupe Steria, C‑386/14, EU:C:2015:524, paragraph 31 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>However, the Netherlands Government does not claim that such a link exists.

In any event, the Netherlands Government does not mention any specific evidence from which it may be concluded that the coherence of the single tax entity scheme would be jeopardised if the deduction of interest in respect of a loan intended to finance the purchase of shares in a non-resident subsidiary were permitted.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, that difference in treatment is justified, according to the Netherlands Government, by the objective of the fight against tax evasion and fraud and aims to prevent conduct involving the creation of wholly artificial arrangements which do not reflect economic reality with a view to evading the tax normally due on the profits generated by activities carried out on national territory.</p>

            <p>That is unquestionably the aim pursued by Article 10a(2)(b) of the Law on corporation tax. As the referring court sets out, it is a question of preventing own funds of a group from being artificially presented as funds borrowed by a Netherlands entity of that group and the interest in respect of that loan from being deducted from the taxable profits in the Netherlands. The purpose of the prohibition of the deduction of interest in respect of intra-group loans is expressly confirmed by the rule that loan interest may be deducted, pursuant to Article 10a(3)(a), if the intra-group transaction is economically justified.</p>

            <p>However, in order for a restriction on the freedom of establishment to be justified on the ground of prevention of abusive practices, the specific objective of that restriction must also be to prevent that abuse (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 September 2006, Cadbury Schweppes and Cadbury Schweppes Overseas, C‑196/04, EU:C:2006:544, paragraph 55). However, the Netherlands Government does not even attempt to show that the difference in treatment referred to in paragraph 30 above is based on such an intention. Nor could that be the case, since the difference in treatment does not stem from Article 10a(2)(b) of the Law on corporation tax alone, but from that provision in conjunction with Article 15 of that law, relating to the single tax entity, which has a different purpose, as is apparent from paragraph 34 above.</p>

            <p>In addition, as the Advocate General observed in point 82 of his Opinion, that difference in treatment is not objectively justifiable by the prevention of abusive practices. When a parent company finances the purchase of shares in a subsidiary by a loan taken out with another related company, the risk that that loan does not reflect a genuine economic transaction and is intended simply to create a deductible charge artificially is no less if the parent company and the subsidiary are both resident in the same Member State and together form a single tax entity than if the subsidiary is established in another Member State and is not, therefore, permitted to form a single tax entity with the parent company.</p>

Articles 49 and 54 TFEU must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, pursuant to which a parent company established in a Member State is not allowed to deduct from its profits capital losses derived from fluctuations in the exchange rate, in connection with the value of its shares in a subsidiary established in another Member State, where the same legislation does not provide, symmetrically, for tax to be levied on capital gains derived from those fluctuations.</p>
