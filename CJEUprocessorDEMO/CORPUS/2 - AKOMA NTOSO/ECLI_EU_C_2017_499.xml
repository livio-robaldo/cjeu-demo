For each sector within the meaning of the first subparagraph and for a sector external to them, they must include in the annex to their annual accounts a balance sheet and an additional profit and loss account, kept in accordance with the principles of commercial law. ...(1b)   Public funds paid to one of the two sectors of activity referred to in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1a shall not be transferred to the other. The accounts for the two sectors of activity shall be kept in a way that reflects this prohibition. This also applies to undertakings within the meaning of points (2) and (3) in the first subparagraph of paragraph 1. ...(1d)   For public railway undertakings providing railway services in both for passenger and freight transport, paragraph 1a shall apply mutatis mutandis, with the proviso that the necessity to draw up separate accounts or include in the annex to the annual accounts a balance sheet and an additional profit and loss account applies only in respect of the railway freight sector and that that balance sheet may also be replaced by a statement of assets. Public funds paid for activities relating to the provision of passenger transport services as public-service remits must be shown separately in the relevant accounts and may not be transferred to activities relating to the provision of other transport services or any other business. ...'</p>

In doing so they may levy mark-ups on the cost that is directly incurred as a result of operating the rail service, and may distinguish between long-distance passenger services, short-distance passenger services and rail freight services, and also between market segments within those services, while guaranteeing competitiveness, in particular of international rail freight.

It follows that the essential points of law and of fact on which such an action is based must be indicated coherently and intelligibly in the application itself (judgment of 2 June 2016, Commission v Netherlands, C‑233/14, EU:C:2016:396, paragraph 32 and the case-law cited).</p>

In so doing, DB AG, to which the undifferentiated profits of its subsidiaries managing railway infrastructure are transferable, could use them at will.</p>

            <p>In that regard, the Federal Republic of Germany submits, in essence, that the Commission misinterprets the contested provision since it wrongly treats `balance sheet' and `accounting' in the same way and that the transparency requirement therein does not require public funds to appear in the company's external accounts, namely, the balance sheet, the income statement or the activity report. It requires only separate accounting for the transport and infrastructure companies, a requirement satisfied in this case, DB Netz, DB Station &amp; Service and DB Energie being legally autonomous and not providing transport services. The purpose of that provision is not to control the use of funds in accordance with their allocation, but only to ensure fair and non-discriminatory access to infrastructure.</p>

In that regard, it points out that the Court has recognised the lawfulness of undertakings structured in the form of a holding company and that the Commission's approach restricts the managerial independence of groups of railway undertakings, contrary to Articles 4 and 5 of Directive 91/440.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, Directive 2001/14 does not preclude the transfer of profits from charges from the use of railway infrastructure calculated on the basis of an adequate rate of return on the undertaking's own funds. The first subparagraph of Paragraph 14(4) of the AEG provides, in addition, that the charges must be fixed so that they cover the railway infrastructure manager's costs and a rate of return may be added if the market could bear this. Contrary to the view put forward by the Commission, income generated in this way does not create any infrastructure funding deficit.</p>

            <p>In the reply, the Commission states that Article 6 of Directive 2001/14 is explained by the method of calculating the infrastructure charges, which is usually based on the direct costs, and by the chronic deficit which infrastructure managers face if the public authorities do not assume, at least in part, liability for infrastructure costs. Viewed in that way, Article 6 of Directive 2001/14 requires Member States to take financial responsibility vis-à-vis infrastructure managers by balancing their budgets.</p>
