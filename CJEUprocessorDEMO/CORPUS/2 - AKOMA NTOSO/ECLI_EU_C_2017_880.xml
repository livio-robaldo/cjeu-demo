Those conditions and requirements include, as is clear from point 1(f)(iii) and (v) of Part I, an undertaking by that association, first, to verify continuously, and, in particular, before requesting authorisation for access of persons to the TIR procedure, the fulfilment of the minimum conditions and requirements by such persons as laid down in Part II of Annex 9 to the convention and, secondly, to cover its liabilities with an insurance company, pool of insurers or financial institution.</p>

That obligation, furthermore, cannot lead to excessive procedural obligations on the part of the competent customs authority which fail to take any account of the guaranteeing association's own responsibilities in implementing the TIR procedure, and which are incompatible with the objective, referred to in the above paragraph, of facilitating the recovery of the customs debt.</p>

It follows, furthermore, from the very nature of joint and several liability that each debtor is liable for the full amount of the debt and the creditor is, in principle, free to claim payment of that debt from one or more of the debtors as he chooses (see, to that effect, judgment of 18 May 2017, Latvijas dzelzceļš, C‑154/16, EU:C:2017:392, paragraph 85).</p>

            <p>, the competent customs authorities notified the TIR carnet holder that the TIR operation had not been discharged and claimed payment of those debts from it, with the result that the minimum requirements indicated in the explanatory note to Article 8(7) of the TIR Convention were properly fulfilled, at least in so far as concerns that holder. Moreover, those authorities even went beyond those minimum requirements, since, after claiming payment from the guaranteeing association, they applied to the competent tax authorities for enforced recovery from that holder.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the answer to the second question is that Article 8(7) of the TIR Convention must be interpreted as meaning that, in a situation such as that in the main proceedings, the customs authorities have fulfilled the obligation laid down in that provision to require payment of the import duties and taxes concerned, so far as possible, from the holder of the TIR carnet as the person directly liable for those sums, before bringing a claim against the guaranteeing association.</p>

            <p>89 By its third question, the referring court asks whether the third indent of Article 203(3) and Article 213 of the Customs Code must be interpreted as meaning that the fact that a recipient acquired or held goods which he knew to have been conveyed under cover of a TIR carnet and the fact that it has not been established that the goods were presented and declared to the customs office of destination, are sufficient, in themselves, for it to be concluded that such a recipient was aware or should reasonably have been aware that those goods had been removed from customs supervision within the meaning of the first of those provisions and therefore he must be held jointly and severally liable for the customs debt pursuant to the second of those provisions.</p>

That provisions refers, in the plural form, to the `persons from whom the sums mentioned above are due', with whom the guaranteeing association may be jointly and severally liable for payment, while Article 8(7) of that convention refers to payment of those sums by the `person or persons directly liable' for such sums.</p>

The third indent of Article 203(3) of the Customs Code covers any person who, although not responsible for the unlawful removal of the goods from customs supervision from which the customs debt arose, and not himself required to clear the goods through customs, has nevertheless been involved in the unlawful removal either before or after that removal as a result of having acquired or held the goods (see, by analogy, judgment of 25 January 2017, Ultra-Brag, C‑679/15, EU:C:2017:40, paragraph 22).</p>

Accordingly, the status of `debtor' for the purposes of the third indent of Article 203(3) of the Customs Code is subject to conditions based on subjective criteria, namely whether natural or legal persons participated knowingly in acquiring or holding goods removed from customs supervision (see, by analogy, judgment of 3 March 2005, Papismedov and Others, C‑195/03, EU:C:2005:131, paragraph 40 and the case-law cited).</p>
