            <p>After dealing with the question of jurisdiction under a special procedure, that court, by judgment of 22 December 2014, dismissed the action on the ground that the Danish courts did not have jurisdiction, since the agreement on jurisdiction concluded between the parties to the insurance contract was binding on the injured party. Assens Havn has appealed against that judgment to the referring court.</p>

            <p>In the view of the referring court, the main question is whether Assens Havn which, pursuant to Article 95(2) of the Law on insurance contracts, is entitled to act directly against the insurance company of the party which caused the harm, is bound by the agreement on jurisdiction in the insurance contract between Skåne Entreprenad and Navigators, by virtue of Article 13, point 5, of Regulation No 44/2001, considered in conjunction with Article 14, point 2(a), of that regulation. If that is the case, the Sø- og Handelsrett (Maritime and Commercial Court) was correct to dismiss the action brought by Assens Havn.</p>

            <p>The referring court points out that although, under Danish law, an injured party cannot, in principle, bring an action directly against a company providing insurance cover for the party which has caused the harm, Article 95 of the Law on insurance contracts does provide for this where, for example, the policyholder has gone into liquidation, as is the case here.</p>

            <p>In the present case, as is apparent from paragraphs 24 and 25 of this judgment, the referring court, which is responsible for interpreting its own national law, is of the view that Article 95(2) of the Law on insurance contracts, applicable to the dispute in the main proceedings, institutes, in favour of the victim, the right to bring a direct action, within the meaning of Article 11(2) of Regulation No 44/2001, against the insurer.</p>

            <p>As regards whether an agreement on jurisdiction may be invoked against the victim of damage, it is apparent, firstly, that, under Article 13, point 5, of Regulation No 44/2001, read in conjunction with Article 14, point 2(a), thereof, it is possible to derogate by such an agreement from the provisions of Section 3 of that regulation, in particular in the case of insurance contracts covering all liabilities arising from the use or operation of vessels.</p>

            <p>Secondly, it is not in dispute that Article 11(2) of Regulation No 44/2001, pursuant to which Articles 8, 9 and 10 of that regulation apply to direct actions brought by a victim against an insurer, does not refer to Articles 13 and 14 of that regulation and, accordingly, agreements of prorogation of jurisdiction.</p>

            <p>In that regard, the Court has previously noted that, in matters of insurance, prorogation of jurisdiction is strictly circumscribed by the aim of protecting the economically weaker party (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 May 2005, Société financière et industrielle du Peloux, C‑112/03, EU:C:2005:280, paragraph 31).</p>

            <p>Moreover, under Article 23(5) of that regulation, agreements on jurisdiction have no legal force if they are contrary to Article 13. It follows from those provisions that that regulation establishes a system in which derogations from the jurisdictional rules in matters of insurance must be interpreted strictly (see, by analogy, judgment of 12 May 2005, Société financière et industrielle du Peloux, C‑112/03, EU:C:2005:280, paragraph 31).</p>

            <p>Moreover, it is clear that the situation of a third party victim of insured damage is even farther removed from the contractual relationship involving an agreement on jurisdiction than an insured beneficiary who did not expressly consent to that agreement, as referred to in the judgment of 12 May 2005, Société financière et industrielle du Peloux ( C‑112/03, EU:C:2005:280).</p>

            <p>The view must therefore be taken that an agreement on jurisdiction made between an insurer and an insured party cannot be invoked against a victim of insured damage who wishes to bring an action directly against the insurer before the courts for the place where the harmful event occurred, as recalled in paragraph 31 of this judgment, or before the courts for the place where the victim is domiciled, a possibility accepted by the Court in its judgment of 13 December 2007, FBTO Schadeverzekeringen ( C‑463/06, EU:C:2007:792, paragraph 31).</p>
