Paragraph 1(1) of that law classifies as `payment service providers' credit institutions, electronic money institutions, the Federal State, the Länder and municipalities, and the European Central Bank, the Deutsche Bundesbank and the other central banks in the European Union. Under Paragraph 1(1)(5), undertakings which, although not themselves included among those entities, provide payment services commercially or to an extent requiring a commercially organised business operation are also payment service providers.

            <p>Mr Rasool is the manager of RE, which operates two gaming arcades in Germany equipped with slot machines. Until the end of 2012, RE made available to customers of the gaming arcades multifunctional terminals which enabled them to exchange banknotes for coins and to withdraw cash by using a bank card and the associated personal identification number (PIN) issued by their bank.</p>

            <p>Until May 2011 the cash withdrawal service was operated in the following manner. The network operator, after the PIN code was entered, checked that the customer's bank account had sufficient funds and, if it did, allowed the cash to be withdrawn. The network operator also ensured that on each occasion RE was reimbursed amounts corresponding to the sums withdrawn by customers. RE for its part did not receive any remuneration in return for making the multifunctional terminals available, and it paid the network operator EUR 0.13 per transaction and a fixed monthly remuneration of EUR 48. In short, the only activity of RE consisted in loading the multifunctional terminals with cash.</p>

            <p>From June 2011, following an amendment to national legislation, in order to be able to continue supplying the cash withdrawal service without holding an authorisation as a payment service provider, RE partly changed the method of functioning of the multifunctional terminals installed in the gaming arcades, so that they offered a `cash back' option. With this method, customers could no longer withdraw money from the multifunctional terminals unless they ordered at the same time a voucher for EUR 20 allowing them to put coins in the slot machines. That amount was debited to the customers' accounts by their banks, in addition to the amount of cash withdrawn.</p>

            <p>Since it took the view that even with this method of operation RE should be classified as a `payment institution' requiring authorisation as such, the Staatsanwaltschaft Stuttgart (Public Prosecutor's Office, Stuttgart, Germany) brought criminal proceedings against Mr Rasool, in his capacity as manager of RE, for intentionally providing payment services without authorisation, contrary to Paragraph 8 of the Law on the supervision of payment services. On the basis of Paragraph 73 of the Criminal Code, it applied for forfeiture of all the sums credited to RE by the various banks of the customers who had made withdrawals. Those sums amounted to EUR 1096290. By judgment of 11 March 2015, the referring court, the Amtsgericht Nürtingen (Local Court, Nürtingen, Germany) acquitted Mr Rasool, on the ground that he had not provided payment services within the meaning of the Law on the supervision of payment services.</p>

            <p>The Stuttgart Public Prosecutor's Office appealed on a point of law against that judgment to the Oberlandesgericht Stuttgart (Higher Regional Court, Stuttgart, Germany), which by judgment of 18 March 2016 set aside the referring court's judgment of 11 March 2015, on the ground in particular that, although the operation of the multifunctional terminals was not the main activity of RE, it could not avoid the obligation to obtain authorisation under Paragraph 8(1) of the Law on the supervision of payment services. The case was therefore remitted to the referring court.</p>

          <content eId="para_9253__content">
            <p>In those circumstances, that court considers, first, that the activity carried on by RE falls within the exception in Article 3(o) of Directive 2007/64, in particular because RE was not a `party to the framework contract with the customer withdrawing money from a payment account' within the meaning of that provision and had not concluded any contract with the banks of its customers withdrawing money by means of the multifunctional terminals. The court further considers that no requirement of consumer protection appears to justify the obligation for RE to obtain authorisation to provide payment services, since all that company does is load the multifunctional terminals with cash.</p>

          <content eId="para_9254__content">
            <p>Secondly, the referring court considers that in any event, after the change to the `cash back' system, RE's activity falls within the scope of Article 3(e) of Directive 2007/64, and that consequently that activity is not subject to authorisation.</p>

          <content eId="para_9255__content">
            <p>Thirdly, the referring court asks the Court whether the service offered by RE can be categorised as a `payment service', in particular in so far as the activities of that company enable cash withdrawals from a payment account within the meaning of point 2 of the annex to Directive 2007/64.</p>

          <content eId="para_9256__content">
            <p>The referring court observes in this respect that the loading of the multifunctional terminals with cash by RE indeed offered customers of the gaming arcades the material possibility of withdrawing cash. However, in its opinion, the term `enabling' in point 2 of the annex to Directive 2007/64 cannot cover activities, such as those carried out by RE in the present case, that are purely ancillary to the payment services provided by a bank, namely those enabling an account to be opened and operations to be performed from the account by means of a bank card, and by a company, such as the network operator, which links the multifunctional terminals to the customers' bank accounts.</p>

            <p>In addition, the referring court is uncertain whether the activity of which RE is accused may be categorised as a `payment service', since it was a service provided free of charge to the customers of the gaming arcades. Such a free service is purely ancillary to RE's main activity, namely the operation of the gaming arcades, so that it does not satisfy the condition in Article 4(3) of Directive 2007/64 that the provider's activity must be a business activity.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, the referring court is uncertain whether the prosecution brought by the Stuttgart Public Prosecutor's Office might not infringe the principles identified in the Court's case-law according to which intervention by the State in the field of games of chance is not justified where the Member State concerned does not pursue a consistent and systematic policy corresponding to an overriding requirement such as the protection of consumers. Moreover, those prosecutions are arbitrary, in so far as the unlawful provision of a money withdrawal service, such as that said to have been offered by RE, is only very rarely the subject of criminal proceedings.</p>

            <p>Article 4(3) of Directive 2007/64, read in conjunction with point 2 of the annex to the directive, categorises as a `payment service' a business activity enabling cash withdrawals from a payment account as well as all the operations required for operating a payment account.</p>

            <p>In the present case, without it being necessary to establish whether or not the service at issue in the main proceedings, given that it is said to have been provided free of charge, constituted a business activity of RE, it must be observed that, according to the order for reference, RE did no more than lease and install the multifunctional terminals in its gaming arcades and load them with cash.</p>

            <p>While those actions were preliminary steps linked to the operations performed on the payment accounts of the customers of the gaming arcades, it is apparent from the order for reference that those operations were carried out by an external provider, namely the network operator. It was the network operator who operated the link between the multifunctional terminals and the bank accounts of those customers, by recognition of their bank card and PIN code, thus making the withdrawal of cash possible.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, it cannot be found that a service such as that offered by RE by means of the multifunctional terminals enabled `cash withdrawals from a payment account' within the meaning of point 2 of the annex to Directive 2007/64. Moreover, there is no information before the Court to show that on the occasion of that service RE carried out `all the operations required for operating a payment account' within the meaning of that provision.</p>

            <p>According to recital 6 of Directive 2007/64, the directive does not effect a complete harmonisation in the field of payment services.

            <p>However, subject to the assessment of the referring court in this respect, the documents before the Court show that RE's main activity was the operation of gaming arcades and that, in that context, the operations concerning the multifunctional terminals formed part of a service that was purely ancillary to that activity.</p>

            <p>Secondly, since RE did not perform any operation relating to the accounts of the customers of the gaming arcades, requirements of the protection of consumers as recipients of payment services, apparent from recitals 20, 22, 26, 36 and 54 of Directive 2007/64, do not justify the categorisation as a `payment service' within the meaning of that directive of a cash withdrawal service such as that offered by RE.</p>
