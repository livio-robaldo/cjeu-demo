            <p>The Landgericht Hannover (Hanover Regional Court, Germany) takes the view that, in principle, this action should not be upheld, since all the national laws that are potentially applicable in the case require the consumer expressly to set an additional deadline so that the contractor may repair the defects in question, unless the setting of such a deadline is superfluous, which it is not possible to establish on the basis of the facts and the evidence submitted in the main proceedings. The referring court states that such a date was set, in good time, not by Mrs Schottelius, the beneficiary of the rights under the warranty, but by her husband, as set out in a letter from a lawyer dated 16 November 2011. Further, the notice given by Mrs Schottelius's husband, as a third party, is, according to the referring court, invalid under German law, since Mr Schottelius had assigned his rights under the guarantee to his wife. Mrs Schottelius maintains that, in any event, Mr Seifert had a sufficient period of time to remedy the defects in question.</p>

            <p>By its question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the second indent of Article 3(5) of Directive 1999/44 must be interpreted as meaning that, in accordance with a principle of EU consumer protection law, in order for a consumer who has entered into a contract with a seller for consumer goods to be able to enforce his secondary rights under a warranty, it is sufficient for the seller to have failed to take remedial action within a reasonable period of time, without it being necessary for the consumer to have set a time limit for rectifying the defects in question.</p>

According to that government and the institution, Directive 1999/44 is not applicable to the dispute in the main proceedings since, inter alia, the relevant contract is not a `contract of sale' within the meaning of that directive, but is rather a `contract for work'.

            <p>In this regard, it should be noted at the outset that it is for the Court to examine the conditions in which the case was referred to it by the national court, in order to assess whether it has jurisdiction (see, to that effect, orders of 3 July 2014, Tudoran, C‑92/14, EU:C:2014:2051, paragraph 35 and case-law cited, and of 4 September 2014, Szabó, C‑204/14, not published, EU:C:2014:2220, paragraph 16).</p>

            <p>It also follows from established case-law that, in principle, the Court only has jurisdiction to interpret the provisions of EU law that are actually applicable in the main proceedings (see, to that effect, judgments of 18 December 1997, Annibaldi, C‑309/96, EU:C:1997:631, paragraph 13, and of 7 July 2011, Agafiţei and Others, C‑310/10, EU:C:2011:467, paragraph 28 and case-law cited, and order of 14 April 2016, Târșia, C‑328/15, not published, EU:C:2016:273, paragraph 19 and case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the present case, it must be noted, first, that the referring court is raising a question as to how the second indent of Article 3(5) of Directive 1999/44 should be interpreted. Thus, it proceeds from the premiss that the directive is applicable in a situation such as the one at issue in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>In such circumstances, in order to establish whether the Court has jurisdiction to answer the question that has been referred to it, it is necessary to consider whether Directive 1999/44 must be interpreted as also applying to a contract for work, such as the contract at issue in the main proceedings, which relates to the renovation of a swimming pool by a contractor.</p>

            <p>It is clear from, inter alia, Article 1(1) of that directive that the latter's objective is to approximate the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States on certain aspects of the `sale' of consumer goods and associated guarantees. It is also apparent from that directive and, in particular, from Article 1(2) thereof, which defines, inter alia, the terms `consumer' and `seller', that the directive only applies to contracts of sale entered into between a professional seller and a consumer-purchaser.</p>

            <p>In the second place, it should be noted that, according to the Court's settled case-law, it follows from the need for a uniform application of EU law that, where a provision thereof makes no reference to the law of the Member States with regard to a particular concept, that concept must be given an autonomous and uniform interpretation throughout the European Union which must take into account the context of the provision and the objective pursued by the legislation in question (see, inter alia, judgment of 9 November 2016, Wathelet, C‑149/15, EU:C:2016:840, paragraph 28 and case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Although the text of Directive 1999/44 does not define `contract of sale', nor does it contain any reference to national laws as regards the meaning to be applied to that term. It therefore follows that it must be regarded, for the purposes of application of the directive, as designating an autonomous concept of EU law which must be interpreted in a uniform manner throughout the European Union (see, by analogy, judgment of 18 October 2011, Brüstle, C‑34/10, EU:C:2011:669, paragraph 26).</p>

            <p>In the third place, in order to determine whether a contract for work, such as the one at issue in the main proceedings, which involves a supply of services, can be considered to be a `contract of sale' within the meaning of that directive, it should be noted that the directive sets out explicitly the contracts that involve a supply of services which are capable of being deemed to be equivalent to contracts of sale.</p>

          <num>34</num>
          <content eId="para_16430__content">
            <p>Indeed, it is apparent from the provisions of Directive 1999/44 as well as from the context of the directive that the notion of `sale' only covers certain contracts that are capable of falling within other classifications under national legal systems, namely contracts for work or services.</p>

          <content eId="para_16431__content">
            <p>Thus, first, under Article 1(4) of that directive, `contracts for the supply of consumer goods to be manufactured or produced shall also be deemed contracts of sale.' Consequently, a contract whose subject is the sale of an asset that must first be manufactured or produced by the seller does fall within the scope of the directive.</p>

            <p>Second, Article 2(5) of Directive 1999/44 deems a lack of conformity resulting from incorrect installation of the consumer goods to be equivalent to lack of conformity of the goods if, among other things, installation forms part of the contract of sale of those goods. Thus, the service for the installation of goods, when associated with the sale, does fall within the scope of that directive.</p>

            <p>It follows from the findings above that, first, Directive 1999/44 applies not only to contracts of sale sensu stricto, but also to certain categories of contract involving a supply of services, which, in accordance with applicable national law, are capable of falling within the classification of contracts for services or work, namely contracts for the supply of consumer goods to be manufactured or produced and contracts providing for the installation of such goods linked to the sale.</p>

            <p>In the fourth place, such an interpretation of the notion of `contracts of sale' within the meaning of Directive 1999/44 is supported by the preparatory documents relating to that directive and by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods signed in Vienna on 11 April 1980, on which that directive was based.</p>

            <p>In this regard, it must be noted that it is apparent from the Explanatory Memorandum to the Proposal for a European Parliament and Council Directive on the sale of consumer goods and associated guarantees (COM(95) 520 final) submitted by the Commission on 23 August 1996 ( OJ 1996 C 307, p. 8) that `the complexity and diversity of services do not lend themselves to a simple extension to services of rules governing the sale of goods'. Thus, owing to their particular characteristics, services should not in principle fall within the scope of Directive 1999/44.</p>

            <p>The explicit inclusion of certain categories of contract that contemplate both a sale and a supply of services, as referred to in paragraphs 35 and 36 of this judgment, can be explained, in particular, by the fact that the EU legislature intended, in the first place, to address the difficulty the consumer has in differentiating the two roles performed by the professional and, in the second place, to ensure a high level of consumer protection, as stated in recital 1 of Directive 1999/44.</p>

            <p>The proposal for a directive referred to in paragraph 40 of this judgment explains, to that effect, that the installation of goods linked to a sale should fall within the scope of that directive given, first, the difficulty in practice of distinguishing the service (installation of the goods) from the sale of those goods and, second, the need to protect the consumer consistently.</p>

            <p>As regards the notion of treating contracts for the provision of consumer goods to be manufactured or produced, as referred to in Article 1(4) of Directive 1999/44, as contracts of sale, this was included during the first reading of that proposal for a directive by the Parliament, in the light of Article 3(1) of the United Nations convention mentioned in paragraph 39 of this judgment. The aim was to take into account, inter alia, the difficulty involved in classifying those contracts that include both an obligation to do something, which is particular to contracts for work and services, and an obligation to deliver an asset, which is the characteristic of a contract of sale.</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is apparent from the documents before the Court that Mrs Schottelius and her husband asked Mr Seifert, a contractor, to renovate their swimming pool. For that purpose, they entered into a contract for work with Mr Seifert. Under that contract, the contractor did indeed sell them various goods necessary to renovate that swimming pool, such as, for example, a filtration system featuring a pump. Nevertheless, it is clear that the provision of services for the installation of the goods is the principal subject of that contract for work and that the sale of the goods is merely ancillary by comparison with that provision of services.</p>
