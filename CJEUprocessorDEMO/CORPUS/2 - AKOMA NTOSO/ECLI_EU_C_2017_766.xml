                <p>The rules of jurisdiction should be highly predictable and founded on the principle that jurisdiction is generally based on the defendant's domicile. Jurisdiction should always be available on this ground save in a few well-defined situations in which the subject matter of the dispute or the autonomy of the parties warrants a different connecting factor. The domicile of a legal person must be defined autonomously so as to make the common rules more transparent and avoid conflicts of jurisdiction.</p>

                <p>In addition to the defendant's domicile, there should be alternative grounds of jurisdiction based on a close connection between the court and the action or in order to facilitate the sound administration of justice. The existence of a close connection should ensure legal certainty and avoid the possibility of the defendant being sued in a court of a Member State which he could not reasonably have foreseen. This is important, particularly in disputes concerning non-contractual obligations arising out of violations of privacy and rights relating to personality, including defamation.'</p>

            <p>On 29 September 2015, Bolagsupplysningen, a company incorporated under Estonian law, and Ms Ilsjan, an employee of that company, brought an action against Svensk Handel, a company incorporated under Swedish law which is a trade association, before the Harju Maakohus (Harju Court of First Instance, Estonia). The applicants in the main proceedings asked that court to require Svensk Handel to rectify incorrect information, published on its website, pertaining to Bolagsupplysningen and to delete the comments appearing there, to pay to Bolagsupplysningen the amount of EUR 56634.99 as compensation for harm sustained and to pay to Ms Ilsjan fair compensation for non-material damage, as assessed by the court.</p>

          <content eId="para_727__content">
            <p>According to the application, Svensk Handel had included Bolagsupplysningen in a `blacklist' on its website, stating that the company carries out acts of fraud and deceit. The application states that on the discussion forum on that site there are approximately 1000 comments, a number of which are direct calls for acts of violence against Bolagsupplysningen and its employees, including Ms Ilsjan. Svensk Handel refused to remove Bolagsupplysningen from the list and to delete the comments, allegedly paralysing Bolagsupplysningen's business activities in Sweden with the result that the company suffers material damage on a daily basis.</p>

            <p>By its order of 1 October 2015, the Harju Maakohus (Harju Court of First Instance) held that the action was inadmissible. According to that court, it was not possible to apply Article 7(2) of Regulation No 1215/2012, since it did not appear from the application that the damage had occurred in Estonia. The court found that the information and comments at issue were published in Swedish and, without a translation, they were incomprehensible to persons residing in Estonia. Comprehension of the information at issue was language dependent. The occurrence of damage in Estonia had not been proved and the reference to turnover in Swedish kronor suggested that the damage had been caused in Sweden. The fact that the website at issue was accessible in Estonia could not automatically justify an obligation to bring a civil case before an Estonian court.</p>

            <p>Nonetheless, the referring court adds that, unlike an intellectual and industrial property right, whose protection is limited to the territory of the Member State in which that right is registered, the rights that have allegedly been infringed in the present case are not, by their nature, rights that can only be protected within the territory of certain Member States (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 October 2013, Pinckney, C‑170/12, EU:C:2013:635, paragraphs 35 to 37). Bolagsupplysningen claims, in essence, that the publication of the incorrect information has harmed its good name and reputation. In that regard, the Court of Justice has previously held that injury caused by a defamatory publication to the reputation and good name of a legal person occurs in the places where the publication is distributed and in which the victim claims to have suffered injury to its reputation (judgment of 7 March 1995, Shevill and Others, C‑68/93, EU:C:1995:61, paragraphs 29 and 30).</p>

            <p>However, it is the view of the referring court that it is not possible to determine with certainty whether Bolagsupplysningen may, on the basis of the principles mentioned in the paragraph above, also seek the rectification of the incorrect information and the deletion of the comments before an Estonian court.</p>

            <p>Nor is it possible to determine whether Bolagsupplysningen may also seek compensation for the entirety of the damage that it claims to have suffered before the Estonian courts. Recalling the principle that a person who considers that his rights have been infringed by means of content placed online on a website has the option of bringing an action for damages, in respect of all the harm caused, either before the courts of the Member State in which the publisher of that content is established or before the courts of the Member State in which the centre of his interests is based (judgment of 25 October 2011, eDate Advertising and Others, C‑509/09 and C‑161/10, EU:C:2011:685, paragraph 52), the referring court notes that that principle was adopted specifically in the context of the infringement of the personality rights of a natural person. The referring court states that this is why it has not been established that that principle also applies to legal persons.</p>

            <p>Lastly, the referring court is uncertain whether the seat and/or the place of business of a legal person provide sufficient grounds for assuming that the centre of interests of that legal person is also located there. Regardless of whether such a premiss should be relied on, the question arises as to which circumstances and criteria a court is to take into account in determining where the centre of interests of a legal person is located.</p>

            <p>It is settled case-law that the rule of special jurisdiction in matters relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict must be interpreted independently, by reference to the scheme and purpose of the regulation of which it forms part (see, to that effect, judgment of 25 October 2011, eDate Advertising and Others, C‑509/09 and C‑161/10, EU:C:2011:685, paragraph 38).</p>

            <p>The case in the main proceedings does not concern the question whether or not the action can be brought before the Estonian courts by virtue of them being the courts for the place of the event giving rise to the damage. It is common ground that that place is not situated within the jurisdiction of the courts seised by Bolagsupplysningen and Ms Ilsjan.

            <p>In the specific context of the internet, the Court has, nonetheless, ruled, in a case relating to a natural person, that, in the event of an alleged infringement of personality rights by means of content placed online on a website, the person who considers that his rights have been infringed must have the option of bringing an action for damages, in respect of all the harm caused, before the courts of the Member State in which the centre of his interests is based (judgment of 25 October 2011, eDate Advertising and Others, C‑509/09 and C‑161/10, EU:C:2011:685, paragraph 52).</p>

            <p>As regards such content, the alleged infringement is usually felt most keenly at the centre of interests of the relevant person, given the reputation enjoyed by him in that place.

            <p>In that regard, the Court has pointed out that the rule of special jurisdiction in matters relating to tort, delict or quasi-delict does not pursue the same objective as the rules on jurisdiction laid down in Sections 3 to 5 of Chapter II of Regulation No 1215/2012, which are designed to offer the weaker party stronger protection (see, to that effect, judgment of 25 October 2012, Folien Fischer and Fofitec, C‑133/11, EU:C:2012:664, paragraph 46). The criterion of the centre of interests is intended to determine the place in which damage caused by online content occurs and, consequently, the Member State whose courts are best able to hear and to rule upon the dispute.</p>

            <p>As to the identification of the centre of interests, the Court has stated that, with regard to a natural person, this generally corresponds to the Member State of his habitual residence. However, such a person may also have his centre of interests in a Member State in which he does not habitually reside, in so far as other factors, such as the pursuit of a professional activity, may establish the existence of a particularly close link with that State (judgment of 25 October 2011, eDate Advertising and Others, C‑509/09 and C‑161/10, EU:C:2011:685, paragraph 49).</p>

          <content eId="para_757__content">
            <p>As regards a legal person pursuing an economic activity, such as the applicant in the main proceedings, the centre of interests of such a person must reflect the place where its commercial reputation is most firmly established and must, therefore, be determined by reference to the place where it carries out the main part of its economic activities. While the centre of interests of a legal person may coincide with the place of its registered office when it carries out all or the main part of its activities in the Member State in which that office is situated and the reputation that it enjoys there is consequently greater than in any other Member State, the location of that office is, not, however, in itself, a conclusive criterion for the purposes of such an analysis.</p>

            <p>Thus, when the relevant legal person carries out the main part of its activities in a Member State other than the one in which its registered office is located, as is the case in the main proceedings, it is necessary to assume that the commercial reputation of that legal person, which is liable to be affected by the publication at issue, is greater in that Member State than in any other and that, consequently, any injury to that reputation would be felt most keenly there. To that extent, the courts of that Member State are best placed to assess the existence and the potential scope of that alleged injury, particularly given that, in the present instance, the cause of the injury is the publication of information and comments that are allegedly incorrect or defamatory on a professional site managed in the Member State in which the relevant legal person carries out the main part of its activities and that are, bearing in mind the language in which they are written, intended, for the most part, to be understood by people living in that Member State.</p>

            <p>It is also appropriate to point out that, in circumstances where it is not clear from the evidence that the court must consider at the stage when it assesses whether it has jurisdiction that the economic activity of the relevant legal person is carried out mainly in a certain Member State, so that the centre of interests of the legal person which is claiming to be the victim of an infringement of its personality rights cannot be identified, that person cannot benefit from the right to sue the alleged perpetrator of the infringement pursuant to Article 7(2) of Regulation No 1215/2012 for the entirety of the compensation on the basis of the place where the damage occurred.</p>
