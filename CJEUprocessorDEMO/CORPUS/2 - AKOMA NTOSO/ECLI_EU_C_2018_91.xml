            <p>Before the tax authorities, NTN claimed that, under the contract at issue, the Municipality of Nagyszénás had entrusted it with the performance of public tasks through the use of financial resources provided by the municipality and that the contract did not constitute a contract for the provision of services. NTN also maintained that it was a `budgetary entity' since it fulfilled its responsibilities by means of `aid', that is to say, financial resources provided by the municipality.</p>

            <p>The Office took the view, in particular, that, NTN had received the compensation at issue in the main proceedings as consideration for providing specific services and that a taxable operation had therefore taken place, with the result that the amount of the compensation was taxable. It found that the fact that the Municipality of Nagyszénás could expressly request NTN to submit reports and to keep it duly informed about the performance of the contract at issue was further evidence that NTN had not received aid, but had rather been remunerated for the provision of specific services.</p>

          <content eId="para_19782__content">
            <p>The Office also found that NTN was to be regarded as a taxable person. On the one hand, NTN did not have the status of a body authorised to exercise public powers, for it was not a body financed through the State budget, but a commercial company established by the Municipality of Nagyszénás and registered in the commercial register. On the other hand, the activity carried out by NTN was not an activity pertaining to public authorities, but rather an economic activity, that company merely contributing to the performance of municipal tasks rather than carrying them out directly. In that context, the Office also noted that it was relevant that NTN supplied services not only to the Municipality of Nagyszénás, but also to other persons, and that NTN had exercised its right to deduct VAT in that regard.</p>

          <content eId="para_19783__content">
            <p>The court hearing the case at first instance dismissed the action brought by NTN against the decisions of the Office. It considered that there were no grounds for holding that NTN performed public tasks under the contract at issue, since NTN was not a `budgetary entity', but a commercial company carrying on non-profit-making activity, and the Municipality of Nagyszénás remained responsible for the performance of those public tasks.</p>

          <content eId="para_19784__content">
            <p>Furthermore, that court took the view that the compensation had been paid as consideration for the services that NTN had to perform under the contract, rather than generally financing NTN's activity, so that it constituted a taxable amount for VAT. The fact that NTN deducted the input tax on purchases relating to the performance of those tasks also supported the view that the operations that were the object of the contract were taxable.</p>

            <p>According to the Kúria (Supreme Court, Hungary), before which NTN has brought an appeal on a point of law against the first instance decision, the question that arises in the present case is whether a commercial company such as NTN falls within the scope of Article 13(1) of Directive 2006/112 and whether, in consequence, it is not liable to VAT.</p>

                <p>31 By its third question, which it is appropriate to examine first, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 2(1)(c) of Directive 2006/112 must be interpreted as meaning that an activity such as that at issue in the main proceedings, whereby a company performs certain public tasks under a contract concluded between that company and a municipality, constitutes a supply of services effected for consideration and subject to VAT under that provision.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be noted that the possibility of classifying a supply of services as a `transaction for consideration', which, as a general rule, is subject to VAT under Article 2(1)(c) of Directive 2006/112, requires only that there be a direct link between that supply and the consideration actually received by the taxable person. Such a direct link is established if there is a legal relationship between the provider of the service and the recipient pursuant to which there is reciprocal performance, the payment received by the provider of the service constituting the value actually given in return for the service supplied to the recipient (judgments of 29 October 2015, Saudaçor, C‑174/14, EU:C:2015:733, paragraph 32, and of 2 June 2016, Lajvér, C‑263/15, EU:C:2016:392, paragraph 26).</p>

            <p>In the circumstances of the case, it is for the referring court to establish whether it is apparent from the documents before it and, in particular, from the contract at issue that the activities of NTN are effected for consideration and, therefore, constitute an economic activity within the meaning of Article 9(1) of Directive 2006/112, thus conferring on NTN the status of a taxable person. Nonetheless, the Court may provide the referring court with points of interpretation, in the light of the information included in the order for reference, in order to enable it to give its ruling (see, to that effect, judgment of 29 October 2015, Saudaçor, C‑174/14, EU:C:2015:733, paragraph 34).</p>

            <p>The direct nature of that link could not be called into question by the fact, assuming it were to be established, that the contract at issue contained clauses allowing, in certain circumstances, the amount of compensation to be adjusted; nor by the fact that that amount was fixed at a level lower than the open market value, provided that the amount of compensation was determined in advance on the basis of well-established criteria which ensured that it was sufficient to cover the operating costs of NTN (see, to that effect, judgments of 29 October 2015, Saudaçor, C‑174/14, EU:C:2015:733, paragraph 38, and of 2 June 2016, Lajvér, C‑263/15, EU:C:2016:392, paragraphs 45 and 46).</p>

            <p>Furthermore, in determining whether the activity at issue in the main proceedings is effected `for consideration', the fact that performance of the public tasks constitutes a legal obligation imposed on the Municipality of Nagyszénás is not capable of calling into question the classification of such an activity as a `supply of services' or the direct link between the service provided and the consideration given in exchange (see, by analogy, judgment of 2 June 2016, Lajvér, C‑263/15, EU:C:2016:392, paragraph 41).</p>

            <p>The fact that the activity at issue consists in the performance of duties conferred and regulated by law in the public interest is irrelevant for the purposes of determining whether that activity can be classified as a supply of services effected for consideration. In that context, the Court has held that, even when the object of the activity in question is to fulfil a constitutional obligation exclusively and directly incumbent upon the Member State concerned, the direct link between the supply of services and the consideration received cannot be called into question by that fact alone (see, inter alia, judgment of 2 June 2016, Lajvér, C‑263/15, EU:C:2016:392, paragraph 42).</p>
