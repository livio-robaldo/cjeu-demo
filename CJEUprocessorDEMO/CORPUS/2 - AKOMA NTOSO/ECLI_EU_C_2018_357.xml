                <p>The introduction of the proceeds of illegal activities into the financial system and their investment after laundering are detrimental to sound and sustainable economic development. Accordingly, Council Directive 91/308/EEC of 10 June 1991 on prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering [( OJ 1991 L 166, p. 77)] introduced a Community mechanism to prevent money laundering by monitoring transactions through credit and financial institutions and certain types of professions. As there is a risk that the application of that mechanism will lead to an increase in cash movements for illicit purposes, Directive 91/308 should be supplemented by a control system on cash entering or leaving the Community.</p>

                <p>At present such control systems are applied by only a few Member States, acting under national legislation. The disparities in legislation are detrimental to the proper functioning of the internal market. The basic elements should therefore be harmonised at Community level to ensure an equivalent level of control on movements of cash crossing the borders of the Community. Such harmonisation should not, however, affect the possibility for Member States to apply, in accordance with the existing provisions of the Treaty, national controls on movements of cash within the Community.'</p>

              <item>

                <p>Must Article 9(1) of Regulation [No 1889/2005] be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which lays down as aggravating circumstances, in the case of failure to comply with the obligation to declare, lack of proof of the lawful origin of the means of payment and inconsistency between the activity carried on by the person concerned [and the amount of the movement]?</p>

                <p>19 The Spanish Government disputes the admissibility of the first question referred on the ground that the fine at issue in the main proceedings is lower than the amount of the undeclared cash and therefore far from double that amount. Therefore, an answer to that question is not necessary to resolve the dispute in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be recalled that it is solely for the national court before which the dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine in the light of the particular circumstances of the case both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court. Consequently, where the questions submitted concern the interpretation or the validity of a rule of EU law, the Court is in principle bound to give a ruling (judgment of 16 June 2015, Gauweiler and Others, C‑62/14, EU:C:2015:400, paragraph 24).</p>

            <p>It follows that questions relating to EU law enjoy a presumption of relevance. The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred for a preliminary ruling by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgment of 16 June 2015, Gauweiler and Others, C‑62/14, EU:C:2015:400, paragraph 25).</p>

            <p>In the present case, the Spanish Government does not dispute the fact that the national legislation at issue in the main proceedings permits the imposition of a fine of up to double the value of the undeclared cash. As is clear from paragraph 9 above, Article 57(3) of Law 10/2010 provides that any failure to comply with the obligation to declare, such as the one at issue in the main proceedings, is punishable by a fine of no less than EUR 600 and no more than double the amount of the undeclared cash.</p>

            <p>The first and second questions, which should be answered together, concern the interpretation of Article 9(1) of Regulation No 1889/2005, and more specifically whether that provision precludes legislation of a Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which provides that the failure to comply with an obligation to declare significant sums of cash entering or leaving the territory of that State is punishable with a fine calculated by taking into account certain aggravating circumstances, and which may be up to double the undeclared amount.</p>

            <p>It should be noted as a preliminary point that, according to settled case-law, in the procedure laid down by Article 267 TFEU providing for cooperation between national courts and the Court of Justice, it is for the latter to provide the national court with an answer which will be of use to it and enable it to determine the case before it. To that end, the Court should, where necessary, reformulate the questions referred to it. The Court may also find it necessary to consider provisions of EU law which the national court has not referred to in its questions (judgment of 13 October 2016, M. and S., C‑303/15, EU:C:2016:771, paragraph 16 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be pointed out that the referring court starts from the premiss that the movement of cash at issue in the main proceedings must be regarded as leaving the European Union, given that Mr Zheng, before his arrival in China, did not have access to the money in his suitcase which had been checked in at the Grand Canary airport.</p>

            <p>It must be recalled in that context that the obligation to declare laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation No 1889/2005 applies only to natural persons entering or leaving the European Union and carrying cash of a value of EUR 10000 or more. In addition, it is clear from that provision that the declaration provided for in that regulation must be made by the natural person concerned to the competent authorities of the Member State through which he or she enters or leaves the European Union.</p>

            <p>Although that regulation does not define the concept of `natural person entering or leaving' the European Union, the Court has already held that that notion is not ambiguous and must be understood as having its normal meaning, that is to say, as referring to the movement of a natural person from a place which is not part of EU territory to a place which is part of that territory, or from a place which is part of EU territory to one which is not (judgment of 4 May 2017, El Dakkak and Intercontinental, C‑17/16, EU:C:2017:341, paragraphs 19 to 21).</p>

The Court held that such a fine goes beyond what is necessary in order to ensure compliance with that obligation and the fulfilment of the objectives pursued by that regulation, given that the penalty provided for in Article 9 does not seek to penalise possible fraudulent or unlawful activities, but solely a breach of that obligation (judgment of 16 July 2015, Chmielewski, C‑255/14, EU:C:2015:475, paragraphs 29 31).</p>

            <p>In that regard, although questions concerning EU law enjoy a presumption of relevance, as was observed in paragraphs 20 and 21 above, it is settled case-law that the need to provide an interpretation of EU law which will be of use to the national court makes it necessary for that court to define the factual and legal context of the questions it is asking or, at the very least, to explain the factual circumstances on which those questions are based. The order for reference must also set out the precise reasons why the national court is unsure as to the interpretation of EU law and considers it necessary to refer a question to the Court for a preliminary ruling (judgment of 14 June 2017, Online Games and Others, C‑685/15, EU:C:2017:452, paragraph 43 and the case-law cited).</p>
