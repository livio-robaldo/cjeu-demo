            <p>PPG and SNF claim that the General Court erred in law in its interpretation of the definition of `intermediate' in Article 3(15) of the REACH regulation. They submit that the General Court, in paragraphs 54 to 58 and 66 to 68 of the judgment under appeal, added a condition that was not laid down by that provision. That additional condition restricts the definition of `intermediate' exclusively to substances for which the `main purpose' of the chemical process is the manufacture of another substance. That addition has the consequence of excluding from the category of intermediates any substance synthesised for the purposes of achieving a particular function, corresponding to the end use of that substance.</p>

            <p>In order to determine whether the first ground of appeal, alleging an error of law in the interpretation of the definition of `intermediate', in Article 3(15) of the Reach Regulation, is well founded, it must be noted that, in that regulation, the word `intermediate' is used as a noun to identify certain substances which, on account of their use, enjoy a derogation, consisting of a reduction in certain obligations laid down by that regulation.</p>

            <p>In accordance with the definition in Article 3(15) of the REACH Regulation, the word `intermediate' applies to a substance manufactured for and consumed in or used for chemical processing in order to be transformed into another substance, known as `synthesis'.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, Article 3(15) of the REACH Regulation divides intermediates into three categories. The first, that of a `non-isolated intermediate', concerns an intermediate that is not intentionally removed from the equipment in which it is synthesised. The REACH Regulation does not apply to that first category, by virtue of Article 2(1)(c) of that regulation. The second category, `on-site isolated intermediate', applies to any intermediate in respect of which the manufacturing and synthesis take place on the same site. The third category, `transported isolated intermediate', concerns any intermediate transported from one site to another. The latter two categories of intermediates are exempted from Title VII of that regulation, by virtue of Article 2(8)(b) of that regulation.</p>

            <p>It follows from those facts that Article 3(15) of the REACH Regulation requires three conditions to be fulfilled for the use of a substance to be capable of being regarded as use of an intermediate. As the Advocate General pointed out in point 56 of her Opinion, the first of those conditions concerns the intended purpose at the time of the manufacture and use of a substance as an intermediate, which consists of transforming that substance into another. The second condition concerns the technical means by which that processing takes place, namely a chemical process known as `synthesis'. The third condition restricts the scope of the definition of `intermediate' to uses of a substance which remains confined to a controlled environment, which may be either the equipment within which synthesis takes place, or the site in which the manufacturing and synthesis takes place or to which that substance is transported, `site' being defined in Article 3(16) of the REACH Regulation as a `single location' in which infrastructure and facilities are installed.</p>

            <p>In the present case, as regards the first two conditions referred to in the above paragraph, the General Court held, in paragraph 66 of the judgment under appeal, that `it is apparent from the definition of an intermediate, laid down in Article 3(15) of [the REACH] Regulation, that the classification of a substance as an intermediate depends on the intended purpose of its manufacture and use. [A]ccording to that definition, an intermediate is a substance that is manufactured for chemical processing and consumed in or used in that processing in order to be synthesised'. By that assessment, which was reiterated, in essence, in paragraphs 67 and 68 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court correctly interpreted the definition of `intermediate' and, contrary to what PPG and SNF claim, did not err in law in that regard.</p>

            <p>Moreover, the objections directed against paragraphs 50 to 58 of the judgment under appeal relating to the General Court's assessment concerning the admissibility of the action at first instance, criticise, in essence, the grounds on which the General Court refused to find that acrylamide is exclusively used as an intermediate. In that regard, having found, in paragraph 51 of the judgment under appeal, that 99.9% of acrylamide is used as an intermediate, the General Court considered, for the rest, that the use of that substance in grouting products and for the preparation of electrophoresis gels could not be classified as intermediate use.</p>

          <content eId="para_1914__content">
            <p>As regards grouting products, the General Court, in essence, considered that, although the use of acrylamide involves the chemical transformation of that substance into polyacrylamide, the main purpose of that process was not to produce acrylamide but to perform a grouting function described in paragraph 52 of the judgment under appeal as consisting, inter alia, of water shut-off, concrete repair and salt damp remediation.</p>

            <p>The General Court also held in paragraph 54 of the judgment under appeal that `according to the definition set out in Article 3(15) of [the REACH] Regulation, an intermediate is a substance that is manufactured for chemical processing and consumed in or used in that processing in order to be synthesised. In the present case, it is true that the acrylamide-based grouting agent is used in the manufacture of another substance during which it is itself transformed into that other substance, namely a polymer. However, as ECHA submits, the acrylamide is not used for the purposes of undergoing synthesis, within the meaning of the definition in Article 3(15) of [the REACH] Regulation. It is not used with the aim of manufacturing that other substance, the main purpose of the chemical process being to obtain a sealing function that occurs when the acrylamide grouting agent polymerises. Upon polymerisation, it solidifies into a rigid gel that is waterproof when used in grouting applications. The use of acrylamide as a grouting agent is not an intermediate use, but rather an end use of the substance'.</p>

            <p>However, it should be noted that, since the intended purpose at the time of the manufacture and use of the substance is to transform it into another substance, the first of the three conditions which derive from Article 3(15) of that regulation in order for a substance to be classified as an `intermediate' is satisfied. Article 3(15) of that regulation contains no additional criterion allowing a differentiation to be made according to whether that purpose was primary or secondary in nature or examination of whether or not the chemical process by which one substance is transformed into another is indistinguishable from the end use for which that substance is intended.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, by failing to classify acrylamide, in the context of the process of transformation into polyacrylamide for grouting purposes, as an `intermediate', the General Court, by adding a condition that is not laid down in Article 3(15) of the REACH regulation, misinterpreted that provision.</p>

            <p>However, that error of law does not affect the validity of the judgment under appeal in so far as it relates to grounds included for the sake of completeness. The reasons set out in paragraphs 50 to 58 of the judgment under appeal, which are the subject of the first ground of appeal relating to the admissibility of the action at first instance, follow the finding, not disputed, in paragraph 43 of the judgment under appeal, that the decision at issue may directly affect the legal situation of suppliers of that substance. Those direct effects arise from the obligations to provide information laid down in Article 31(9)(a) of that regulation, while the identification of a substance in accordance with the procedure referred to in Article 59 of the REACH Regulation constitutes new information that may require the suppliers of that substance to update the safety data sheet referred to in Article 31 of that regulation. It follows that the first ground of appeal, in so far as it is directed against paragraphs 50 to 58 of the judgment under appeal, is ineffective.</p>

            <p>PPG and SNF submit that, in finding, in paragraph 65 of the judgment under appeal, that, under Article 59 of the REACH Regulation, any intermediate that may be classified as a `substance' may be subject to the identification procedure provided for by that provision, even though Article 59 comes under Title VII of that regulation, the General Court infringed that article. The fact that a substance has the intrinsic properties of very high concern referred to in Article 57 of that regulation does not authorise ECHA to infringe that regulation.</p>

            <p>According to PPG and SNF, the interpretation of Article 59 of the REACH Regulation made by the General Court in paragraph 66 of the judgment under appeal is incorrect. They claim that it is possible to include a substance on the candidate list of substances while specifying that that inclusion is without prejudice to the use of that substance as an intermediate. Since intermediates are not intended to be included in Annex XIV to that regulation, there is no reason to name them in a list drawn up for the purpose of such inclusion.</p>

            <p>It is apparent from Article 1(1) of that regulation that its purpose is to ensure a high level of protection of human health and the environment, including the promotion of alternative methods for assessment of hazards of substances, as well as the free circulation of substances on the internal market while enhancing competitiveness and innovation. To that end, that regulation introduces an integrated system for monitoring chemical substances, including registration, evaluation and authorisation, together with possible restrictions on their use (see, inter alia, judgment of 15 March 2017, Polynt v ECHA, C‑323/15 P, EU:C:2017:207, paragraph 20).</p>

            <p>As is made clear, inter alia, in recitals 69 and 70 of the REACH Regulation, that regulation makes substances `of very high concern' subject to careful attention. Those substances are thus subject to the authorisation regime laid down in Title VII of that regulation. Article 55 of that regulation states that the aim of the authorisation regime is `to ensure the good functioning of the internal market while assuring that the risks from substances of very high concern are properly controlled and that these substances are progressively replaced by suitable alternative substances or technologies where these are economically and technically viable' (see, inter alia, judgment of 15 March 2017, Polynt v ECHA, C‑323/15 P, EU:C:2017:207, paragraph 21).</p>

That exemption mechanism implies an inextricable link between a substance and its uses or categories of uses (judgment of 13 July 2017, VECCO and Others v Commission, C‑651/15 P, EU:C:2017:543, paragraphs 30 and 37).</p>

            <p>In addition to that special exemption laid down in Article 58(2) of the REACH Regulation, Article 2(8)(b) of that regulation establishes a general exemption, by virtue of which `on-site isolated intermediates and transported isolated intermediates shall be exempted from ...

Such a substance accordingly would escape the identification procedure laid down in Article 59 of that regulation, even if, on account of its intrinsic properties, that substance fell under Article 57 of that regulation and should, consequently, be considered to be of very high concern. The authorisation procedure governed by Chapters 2 and 3 of Title VII of that regulation would thus be inapplicable to such a substance.</p>

            <p>As the Advocate General observed in points 85 to 87 of her Opinion, it is apparent from a combined reading of Article 3(15) of the REACH Regulation, which defines `intermediate', and the provisions of Title VII of that regulation, that the exemption laid down in Article 2(8)(b) of that regulation must be understood as being applicable only to uses of a substance that may be classified as an on-site or transported isolated intermediate.

            <p>It follows that the exemption laid down in Article 2(8)(b) of the REACH Regulation concerns only the authorisation procedure laid down in Chapters 2 and 3 of Title VII of that regulation.

            <p>As the Advocate General pointed out in point 83 of her Opinion, it is apparent from the legislative history of the REACH Regulation that the raison d'être for such a relationship between the authorisation procedure and the exemption for substances used as on-site or transported isolated intermediates relates to the fact that, by their nature, those uses do not give rise to concern and may, accordingly, be exempted from the authorisation procedure.</p>

As has already been pointed out ..., according to that definition, an intermediate is a substance that is manufactured for chemical processing and consumed in or used in that processing in order to be synthesised. In so far as any substance may, in principle, be manufactured for chemical processing and consumed in or used in that processing in order to be synthesised and, therefore, have the status of an intermediate, the fact that a substance has, in a specific case, the status of an intermediate cannot exempt it from the identification procedure provided for by Article 59 [of that regulation]'.</p>
