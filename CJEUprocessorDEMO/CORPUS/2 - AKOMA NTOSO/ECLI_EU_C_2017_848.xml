            <p>The appellant is a Syrian businessman who was made subject to restrictive measures under the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP). His name was added to the list in annex I to Council Decision 2013/255/CFSP of 31 May 2013 concerning restrictive measures against Syria ( OJ 2013 L 147, p. 14) by Implementing Decision 2014/488, and the list in annex II to Council Regulation (EU) No 36/2012 of 18 January 2012 concerning restrictive measures in view of the situation in Syria and repealing Regulation (EU) No 442/2011 (OJ 2012 L 16, p. 1) by Implementing Regulation No 793/2014. He sought, in his application instituting the proceedings before the General Court, the annulment of that implementing decision and that implementing regulation in so far as they concerned him.</p>

            <p>The appellant submits that the General Court was wrong not to take into account his request to modify the application, when that request, even though expressed orally at the hearing, was the object of a written form before the oral phase of the procedure closed, since it was referred to in the minutes of the hearing. He submits that, in that way, and notwithstanding the failure to lodge a separate written document in the strict sense, his request to modify the application should have been regarded as having satisfied the requirements set out in Article 86 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court. He submits, in addition, that the lack of a specific written request did not harm the rights of the opposing party and did not impede the work of the General Court.</p>

            <p>The appellant considers, furthermore, that the General Court erred in law in the judgment under appeal in not taking into account the particular nature of the language of the case that he had chosen, namely Bulgarian. That language version of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court used an ambiguous word which did not necessarily imply a requirement for a separate written document for making a request to modify the application.</p>

            <p>Moreover, he submits that the General Court infringed the principle of audi alteram partem in not granting him additional time in order to lodge an application seeking the annulment of Decision 2015/837, even though he only learned of that decision in the course of the hearing.</p>

            <p>The Council submits that Article 86(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court requires, without any ambiguity, the submission of a written request. Even if the Bulgarian language version diverges from the other language versions in that regard, the Council considers that that language version cannot prevail. All the other language versions use, according to the Council, words that express, incontestably, the need for a separate written document. In any event, a contextual analysis of the whole of Article 86 of the Rules of Procedure suffices to show that it must only concern a written document, in particular as regards items `attached' to the document.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, it must be noted that it is clear from the case-law of the Court that the forms of order sought by the parties may not, in principle, be altered (see, inter alia, the judgment of 11 November 2010, Commission v Portugal, C‑543/08, EU:C:2010:669, paragraph 20 and the case-law cited). Article 86 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court is a codification of pre-existing case-law on the admissible exceptions to the principle that the forms of order sought by the parties are unalterable. The Court's observations, in the present appeal, therefore apply only in the context of that exceptional situation.</p>

          <content eId="para_3321__content">
            <p>It must be recalled that, in direct actions, Article 45 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court allows the applicant to choose the language of the case. In the present case, HX's choice, in the proceedings before the General Court leading to the judgment under appeal, was for the Bulgarian language, of which his lawyer has command.</p>

            <p>The appellant submits before the Court, without being challenged by the Council, that that language version of Article 86(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court is ambiguous, in the sense that, contrary to the English language version ( `separate document') and the French version ( `acte séparé') of that provision, the Bulgarian language version thereof does not use the word `document', but the term `molba' ( `request'). That word does not necessarily convey the requirement of being in writing, since more usually it means the expression of a wish, which could just as well be oral as written.</p>

          <content eId="para_3323__content">
            <p>It is not therefore inconceivable that that ambiguity induced the appellant's lawyer to consider that it would be admissible to request the modification of the application orally at the hearing in which he said he learned of the decision that is the object of the request. Furthermore, the appellant could have been reassured in having that impression by the fact that the said request was, subsequently, recorded in the minutes of the oral hearing, which is an official record, pursuant to Article 102(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court.</p>

          <content eId="para_3324__content">
            <p>If the General Court considered that the request to modify the application submitted in that way did not comply with the form required by its Rules of Procedure, it was under an obligation, at the very least, to inform the appellant of his error and to place him in a position of being able to rectify it.</p>

          <content eId="para_3325__content">
            <p>As the Advocate General observed, in points 33 and 34 of her Opinion, while it is perfectly in order for modification of the application to be subject to certain formal requirements, such formal requirements do not apply for their own sake but are, on the contrary, intended to ensure the adversarial nature of proceedings and the sound administration of justice.</p>

          <num>24</num>
          <content eId="para_3326__content">
            <p>In that regard, Article 86(3) and (4) of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court themselves provide that the failure to satisfy certain formalities in the presentation of requests for modifications does not necessarily render them inadmissible. The same discretion on the part of the General Court is also found in respect of the annexes to the application, since Article 78(5) of the rules provides for a possibility of regularising the annexes in accordance with directions set by the Registrar, failing which the General Court may still decide that the application is nevertheless admissible.</p>

            <p>That conclusion cannot validly be called into question by the argument made by the Council based, first, on the fact that the Bulgarian language version of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court is the only one to contain the ambiguity pointed out by the applicant and, second, on the case-law of the Court according to which the need to apply and interpret EU law uniformly precludes the examination of a provision in one of the language versions in isolation, but requires, on the contrary, its interpretation in the light of all the other language versions in accordance with its author's intention (see, to that effect, the judgments of 12 November 1969, Stauder, 29/69, EU:C:1969:57, paragraph 3; of 17 July 1997, Ferriere Nord v Commission, C‑219/95 P, EU:C:1997:375, paragraph 15, and of 15 October 2015, Grupo Itevelesa and Others, C‑168/14, EU:C:2015:685, paragraph 42).</p>

That presupposes that the action is capable, by its outcome, of procuring an advantage to the party bringing it (judgments of 19 October 1995, Rendo and Others v Commission, C‑19/93 P, EU:C:1995:339, paragraph 13; of 7 June 2007, Wunenburger v Commission, C‑362/05 P, EU:C:2007:322, paragraph 42, and of 28 May 2013, Abdulrahim v Council and Commission, C‑239/12 P, EU:C:2013:331, paragraph 61).</p>
