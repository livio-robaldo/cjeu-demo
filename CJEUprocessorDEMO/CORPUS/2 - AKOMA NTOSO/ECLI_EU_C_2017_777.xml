            <p>That court states that the article at issue is shaping knickers designed as hip panties in knitted fabric with vertical and horizontal elasticity. It states that if the knickers are pulled by hand they are less stretchy horizontally than vertically, and the degree to which horizontal stretchability is restricted may be the subject of different assessments based on individual perceptions.

            <p>That court adds that the Explanatory Notes to the CN relating to subheading 6212 20 00 define `panty girdles' more precisely for the purpose of that subheading, and it is common ground that the article at issue has the characteristics which are described in points (a) and (c) of that explanatory note.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, according to that court, the decisive issue in the present case is whether, in addition to those characteristics, that article also has the characteristics described in the first sentence of point (b) of the second subparagraph of that explanatory note, that is having vertical elasticity and restricted horizontal elasticity.</p>

        <paragraph eId="para_1191">
          <num>26</num>
          <content eId="para_1191__content">
            <p>However, it considers that the words in the first sentence of point (b) of the second subparagraph of that explanatory note, `having vertical elasticity and restricted horizontal elasticity' are not sufficiently clear and precise.</p>

        <paragraph eId="para_1192">
          <num>27</num>
          <content eId="para_1192__content">
            <p>Thus, by its questions, that court asks the Court of Justice to interpret the first sentence of point (b) of the second subparagraph of the Explanatory Notes to the CN relating to subheading 6212 20 00.</p>
          </content>
        </paragraph>

          <num>28</num>
          <content eId="para_1193__content">
            <p>First, the referring court, which starts from the premiss that panty girdles must always have horizontal elasticity, asks in particular about the comparison to be made between horizontal and vertical elasticity. In that connection, it states that horizontal elasticity must be clearly less than vertical elasticity, since only minimal differences in the vertical and horizontal elasticity would not satisfy the requirements set out in that explanatory note.</p>

        </paragraph>
        <paragraph eId="para_1194">
          <num>29</num>
          <content eId="para_1194__content">
            <p>Second, that court observes that the characteristic described as `restricted' can also refer to an absolute restriction on horizontal elasticity, in the sense that the horizontal elasticity of the panty-girdle has, by means of additional constraints, a fixed limit blocking the horizontal elasticity at a certain point of its extension. In that connection, the second sentence of point (b) of the second subparagraph of the Explanatory Note to subheading 6212 20 00 might suggest that that type of restriction on elasticity is covered.</p>
          </content>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph eId="para_1195">
          <num>30</num>
          <content eId="para_1195__content">
            <p>According to that court, the question also arises as to which are the objective criteria on the basis of which either the comparison between vertical and horizontal elasticity is to be made or, if there is an absolute restriction on that elasticity, the characteristics of that elasticity. As regards the case in which a comparison between vertical and horizontal elasticity is to be made, a purely sensory examination by manually stretching the material or use of technical measurement methods providing data on the stretchability of the material used are possible.</p>

          <num>31</num>
          <content eId="para_1196__content">
            <p>Finally, the referring court observes that, since the first sentence of point (b) of the second subparagraph of the Explanatory Notes to the CN relating to subheading 6212 20 00 are incapable of defining the features and characteristics of a panty girdle relevant for classification purposes, it may be necessary, as regards the requirements that the horizontal elasticity must satisfy and, having regard to the HS Explanatory Note relating to heading 6212, to take as a basis only the existence of a verifiable body-supporting function.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the Finanzgericht Hamburg (Finance Court, Hamburg) decided to stay proceedings and seek a preliminary ruling from the Court on the following questions: `1.(a) Are the ...

            <p>It should be stated that as it is clear from Section A, entitled `General Rules for the interpretation of the combined Nomenclature' of Title I, headed `General Rules', in the first part of the CN, entitled Preliminary provisions', the classification of goods is to be determined according to the terms of the headings and any section or chapter notes, the titles of sections, chapters and sub-chapters being provided for ease of reference only (see, to that effect, judgment of 8 December 2016, Lemnis Lighting, C‑600/15, EU:C:2016:937, paragraph 35).</p>

            <p>In the interests of legal certainty and ease of verification, the decisive criterion for the classification of goods for customs purposes is in general to be sought in their objective characteristics and properties as defined in the wording of the relevant heading of the CN and of the notes to the sections or chapters (judgments of 8 December 2016, Lemnis Lighting, C‑600/15, EU:C:2016:937, paragraph 36, and of 16 February 2017, Aramex Nederland, C‑145/16, EU:C:2017:130, paragraph 22).</p>

            <p>It should be borne in mind that the Council of the European Union has conferred upon the Commission, acting in cooperation with the customs experts of the Member States, broad discretion to define the subject matter of tariff headings falling to be considered for the classification of particular goods. However, the Commission's power to adopt the measures mentioned in Article 9(1)(a), (b) (d) and (e) of Regulation No 2658/87, like drafting additional notes, does not authorise it to alter the subject matter of the tariff headings which have been defined on the basis of the HS established by the HS Convention whose scope the European Union has undertaken, under Article 3 thereof, not to modify (judgment of 12 February 2015, Raytek and Fluke Europe, C‑134/13, EU:C:2015:82, paragraph 29).</p>

            <p>Having regard to the intended purpose of the product at issue in the main proceedings, classified as `sculpting knickers' by the referring court and `seamless shapewear' by the main customs office in Hanover, it appears that, by its action, that product is intended to support and sculpt the human body. Therefore, that product has, subject to verification by the referring court, the essential characteristic of very restricted horizontal elasticity in order to support the human body and to create the objective effect of a slimmer silhouette.</p>

            <p>In that connection, Lutz claims essentially that, unlike traditional corsets and girdles, in which the effects of supporting and sculpting the human body are generally achieved by a rigid stitched front panel and elastic side panels, which involves the assembly of the various parts by a sewing machine, the new system of knitted support belt knitted with circular stitching in those under garments, which is a patented technical innovation, automatically incorporates the slimming panels in those garments, so that a graduated corseting effect is incorporated into it.</p>

            <p>Thus, it must be held that the girdle or panty-girdle at issue may be distinguished from ordinary underwear by much reduced horizontal elasticity, in order to support the human body and achieve a slimmer silhouette.</p>
