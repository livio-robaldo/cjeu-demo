            <p>Recital 1 of Directive 2008/98 is worded as follows: `Directive 2006/12/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 5 April 2006 on waste [( OJ 2006 L 114, p. 9)] establishes the legislative framework for the handling of waste in the Community. It defines key concepts such as waste, recovery and disposal and puts in place the essential requirements for the management of waste, notably an obligation for an establishment or undertaking carrying out waste management operations to have a permit or to be registered and an obligation for the Member States to draw up waste management plans. It also establishes major principles such as an obligation to handle waste in a way that does not have a negative impact on the environment or human health, an encouragement to apply the waste hierarchy and, in accordance with the polluter-pays principle, a requirement that the costs of disposing of waste must be borne by the holder of waste, by previous holders or by the producers of the product from which the waste came.'</p>

Furthermore, the recovery of waste and the use of recovered materials should be encouraged in order to conserve natural resources. In the interests of clarity and readability, Directive [2006/12] should be repealed and replaced by a new directive.'</p>

            <p>The referring court specifies that Mr and Mrs Vladika have only a 120-litre container and that VG Čistoća calculates a monthly fee for waste transport in order to generate the invoices for its waste management services on the basis of the size of the containers used. That company therefore generated invoices based on the volume of the containers emptied and not on the weight of the waste actually produced by the defendants in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>The referring court considers that, in order to ensure respect for the principle of equality, the applicant in the main proceedings should set up a collection system under which only the waste actually produced by users would be charged to them. The referring court also takes the view that those users should be provided with special containers for specific waste collection (paper, plastic, mixed waste). The referring court adds that users should not be required to pay for the disposal of waste by way of recycling. It is therefore uncertain as to whether users should be required to pay for all of the items listed on the invoices issued in respect of municipal waste management.</p>

How do EU citizens pay the invoices for the collection and transport of municipal waste, that is, do they pay for the collection and transport of municipal waste according to the volume of the empty bins or containers, or according to the volume of refuse transported, and is any other item included within the fee?'</p>

            <p>So far as concerns the financing of the cost of management and disposal of urban waste, inasmuch as a service provided on a collective basis to a body of `holders' is involved, the Member States are obliged, under Article 15 of Directive 2008/98, to ensure that, in principle, all the users of that service, in their capacity as `holders' within the meaning of Article 3 of that directive, collectively bear the overall cost of disposing of the waste (see, by analogy, judgment of 16 July 2009, Futura Immobiliare and Others, C‑254/08, EU:C:2009:479, paragraph 46).</p>

            <p>As EU law currently stands, there is no legislation adopted on the basis of Article 192 TFEU imposing a specific method upon the Member States for financing the cost of the disposal of urban waste, with the result that the cost may, in accordance with the choice of the Member State concerned, equally well be financed by means of a tax or of a fee or in any other manner. Accordingly, recourse to criteria of invoicing based on the volume of the container provided for users, calculated on the basis of, inter alia, the surface area of the property which they occupy and of its use, may provide a means of calculating the costs of disposing of that waste and allocating those costs among the various holders, in so far as this parameter is such as to have a direct impact on the amount of those costs (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 July 2009, Futura Immobiliare and Others, C‑254/08, EU:C:2009:479, paragraphs 48 and 50).</p>

            <p>Consequently, national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which, for the purposes of financing the management and disposal of urban waste, provides for a fee calculated on the basis of an estimate of the volume of waste generated, and not on the basis of the quantity of waste actually produced and presented for collection, cannot, as EU law currently stands, be considered contrary to Article 14 and Article 15(1) of Directive 2008/98 (see, by analogy, judgment of 16 July 2009, Futura Immobiliare and Others, C‑254/08, EU:C:2009:479, paragraph 51).</p>

            <p>Although, as the relevant EU law currently stands, the competent national authorities have a wide discretion with regard to determining how prices are calculated, such as for waste management costs and the additional levy at issue in the main proceedings, it is nonetheless incumbent on the referring court, on the basis of the facts and points of law placed before it, to determine whether the price charged and that additional levy do not result in the imposition on certain `holders' of costs that are manifestly disproportionate to the volume or to the type of waste that they are liable to produce (see, by analogy, judgment of 16 July 2009, Futura Immobiliare and Others, C‑254/08, EU:C:2009:479, paragraphs 55 and 56).</p>

            <p>For that purpose, account should, inter alia, be taken of criteria relating to the type of property that the users occupy, its surface area and use, the productive capacity of the waste `holders', the volume of the containers provided to the users, and the frequency of collection, in so far as those parameters are liable to have a direct impact on the amount of the costs of waste management and disposal.</p>

            <p>In the light of all of the foregoing, the answer to the question referred is that Article 14 and Article 15(1) of Directive 2008/98 must, as EU law currently stands, be interpreted as not precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which, for the purposes of financing an urban waste management and disposal service, provides for a price calculated on the basis of an estimate of the volume of waste generated by users of that service, and not on the basis of the quantity of waste which they have actually produced and presented for collection, as well as for the payment by users, in their capacity as waste holders, of an additional levy intended to finance capital investments necessary for the processing of waste, including the recycling thereof. It is, however, incumbent on the referring court to verify, on the basis of the matters of fact and law placed before it, whether this results in the imposition on certain `holders' of costs which are manifestly disproportionate to the volumes or nature of the waste that they are liable to produce. Accordingly, the national court may take into account, inter alia, criteria relating to the type of property that the users occupy, its surface area and use, the productive capacity of the `holders', the volume of the containers provided to the users, and the frequency of collection, in so far as those parameters are liable to have a direct impact on the amount of the costs of waste management.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Sixth Chamber) hereby rules: Article 14 and Article 15(1) of Directive 2008/98/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 19 November 2008 on waste and repealing certain Directives must, as EU law currently stands, be interpreted as not precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which, for the purposes of financing an urban waste management and disposal service, provides for a price calculated on the basis of an estimate of the volume of waste generated by users of that service, and not on the basis of the quantity of waste which they have actually produced and presented for collection, as well as for the payment by users, in their capacity as waste holders, of an additional levy intended to finance capital investments necessary for the processing of waste, including the recycling thereof.
