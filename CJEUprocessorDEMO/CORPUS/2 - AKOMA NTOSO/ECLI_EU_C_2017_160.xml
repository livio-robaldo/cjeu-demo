It is also stated in Article 4(2) of that regulation that application of the measures referred to in Article 4(1) must be limited to the withdrawal of the advantage obtained plus, where so provided for, interest which may be determined on a flat-rate basis.</p>

            <p>It must be borne in mind that, in accordance with the case-law of the Court, an irregularity is `continuous or repeated' for the purposes of the second subparagraph of Article 3(1) of Regulation No 2988/95 where it is committed by an operator who derives economic advantages from a body of similar transactions which infringe the same provision of EU law (judgment of 11 June 2015, Pfeifer &amp; Langen, C‑52/14, EU:C:2015:381, paragraph 49 and the case-law cited).</p>

There is, therefore, a continuous irregularity in the persistent failure to settle the principal claim, during the entire period in which the operator remains liable for that claim.</p>

            <p>In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the fourth and fifth questions is that the fourth subparagraph of Article 3(1) of Regulation No 2988/95 must be interpreted as meaning that, as regards proceedings resulting in the adoption of administrative measures for the recovery of interest, such as those at issue in the main proceedings, limitation becomes effective on the expiry of the period laid down in the fourth subparagraph of Article 3(1), when within that period the competent authority, while having sought recovery of the aid or amounts wrongly received by the operator concerned, has not adopted a decision regarding that interest.</p>

            <p>62 By its sixth question, the national court asks, in essence, whether Article 3(3) of Regulation No 2988/95 must be interpreted as meaning that a limitation period laid down under national law, which is longer than that laid down in Article 3(1) of that regulation, may be applied, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, as regards the recovery of claims for interest arising before the date on which that period entered into force, not yet time-barred under Article 3(1).</p>

            <p>As regards the principle of proportionality, it is to be noted that the application of a longer national limitation period, such as is referred to in Article 3(3) of Regulation No 2988/95, with a view to bringing proceedings in respect of irregularities, within the meaning of that regulation, must not go clearly beyond what is necessary to achieve the objective of protecting the European Union's financial interests (see, to that effect, judgment of 17 September 2014, Cruz &amp; Companhia, C‑341/13, EU:C:2014:2230, paragraph 59 and the case-law cited). As regards a five-year limitation period, such as that laid down in Article 2224 of the Civil Code, in the version resulting from Law No 2008-561, it must be pointed out that that period is only one year longer than the period laid down in Article 3(1) of Regulation No 2988/95. Consequently, such a period does not go beyond what is necessary to enable the national authorities to bring proceedings in respect of irregularities prejudicing the European Union's budget and complies with the requirement for proportionality.</p>

If it were established that limitation had not become effective by that date, it would be apparent, under the fourth subparagraph of Article 3(1) of Regulation No 2988/95, that the period equal to twice the five-year limitation period provided for by that Law had, in any event, expired as at the date on which the competent authority had adopted its decision as regards the interest at issue in the main proceedings, in April 2013, which it is, however, for the national court to verify.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 3(1) of Council Regulation (EC, Euratom) No 2988/95 of 18 December 1995 on the protection of the European Communities financial interests must be interpreted as meaning that the limitation period laid down in that provision is applicable to the recovery of claims for interest, such as those at issue in the main proceedings, due on the basis of Article 11(3) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3665/87 of 27 November 1987 laying down common detailed rules for the application of the system of export refunds on agricultural products, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 495/97 of 18 March 1997, and Article 5a of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3002/92 of 16 October 1992 laying down common detailed rules for verifying the use and/or destination of products from intervention, as amended by Commission Regulation (EC) No 770/96 of 26 April 1996. 2. The second subparagraph of Article 3(1) of Regulation No 2988/95 must be interpreted as meaning that the fact that an operator is liable for claims for interest, such as those at issue in the main proceedings, does not constitute a `continuous or repeated irregularity' within the meaning of that provision. Such claims must be regarded as resulting from the same irregularity, within the meaning of Article 1(1) of Regulation No 2988/95, as that giving rise to the recovery of the aid and amounts wrongly received, constituting the principal claims. 3. The first subparagraph of Article 3(1) of Regulation 2988/95 must be understood as meaning that, as regards proceedings resulting in the adoption of administrative measures for the recovery of claims for interest, such as those at issue in the main proceedings, the limitation period laid down in the first subparagraph of Article 3(1) starts to run from the date on which the irregularity which gives rise to the recovery of the aid and amounts not due, on the basis of which that interest is calculated, was committed, that is, on the date of the factor constituting that irregularity, namely, either the date of the act or omission or the date of the prejudice, which occurs last. 4. The fourth subparagraph of Article 3(1) of Regulation No 2988/95 must be interpreted as meaning that, as regards proceedings resulting in the adoption of administrative measures for the recovery of interest, such as those at issue in the main proceedings, limitation becomes effective on the expiry of the period laid down in the fourth subparagraph of Article 3(1), when within that period the competent authority, while having sought recovery of the aid or amounts wrongly received by the operator concerned, has not adopted a decision regarding that interest. 5. Article 3(3) of Regulation No 2988/95 must be interpreted as meaning that a limitation period laid down under national law, which is longer than that laid down in Article 3(1) of that regulation, may be applied, in a situation such as that at issue in the main proceedings, as regards the recovery of claims arising before the date on which that period entered into force, not yet time-barred under Article 3(1).</p>
