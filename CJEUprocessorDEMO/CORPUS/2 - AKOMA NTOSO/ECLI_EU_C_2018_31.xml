                <p>The Italian government undertakes to avoid similar problems in the future by imposing the rigorous application of the additional levy on the basis of a new law for the future management of milk quotas, providing a radical overhaul and modernisation of its implementation provisions.

The Commission's requests concerned, inter alia, the allocation of the additional levy between the taxable persons as well as the measures taken for recovery in the event of non-payment, the impact of the legislative amendments introduced on the effectiveness of recovery of the additional levy as well as on the administrative procedures for that recovery and the management of litigation.</p>

            <p>First, it should be noted that in the forms of order sought in its application, the Commission asks the Court to state that the Italian Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under `[t]he relevant provisions of EU law applicable to the years concerned, and in particular' the provisions referred to in paragraph 1 of the present judgment. However, in the introductory part of that application and in paragraph 2 thereof, the Commission lists, without reference to the words `in particular', the various provisions of EU law which are the subject of the alleged infringement. Moreover, it is not clear from that application that the Commission intended to include in its action other provisions of EU law than those explicitly referred to in paragraph 1 of the present judgment. In those circumstances, the forms of order sought must be understood in the sense that they cover only the latter provisions.</p>

          <content eId="para_11584__content">
            <p>Second, it should be made clear that the Commission's action for failure to fulfil obligations relates to the failure of the Italian Republic to take the measures necessary to comply with some of its obligations under EU law and which relate to the scheme for the additional levy on milk production in excess of the national quota available to that Member State. The Commission criticises that Member State for failing to have put in place a scheme ensuring that the additional levy due at the national level is actually allocated to and paid by the economic operators concerned or, failing payment, recovered by the competent authorities.</p>

            <p>The forms of order sought in the application do not, however, refer to the specific amounts to which the lack of recovery would have given rise during the various tax years, or even to an overall amount covering the entirety of the tax years concerned.</p>

            <p>It follows that it is not necessary to determine, in the context of the present action, whether the total amount of the additional levies not yet recovered corresponds to the sum of EUR 1343 million, as indicated in the Commission's pleadings, or the sum of EUR 827.39 million, according to the Italian Republic.</p>

            <p>The Commission claims that, on 11 October 2014, namely the date of the expiry of the period laid down in the reasoned opinion, to which an additional period of one month was added, the Italian Republic had not introduced an effective scheme to recover the amounts due by way of the additional milk levy for the tax years 1995/96 to 2008/09.</p>

            <p>The Commission takes the view that the Italian Republic has failed to fulfil its obligation to allocate and recover in full with due diligence and speed the additional levy between the producers that have contributed to each overrun of the national reference quantities. In that regard, the Commission relies, in particular, on the case-law from the judgment of 21 January 1999, Germany v Commission ( C‑54/95, EU:C:1999:11, paragraph 177), according to which it is incumbent on the Member States, by virtue of the obligation of general diligence laid down in Article 4(3) TEU, to recover promptly the sums due by way of the additional levy.</p>

            <p>Thus, the Commission takes the view that the fact that the amounts due by way of the additional levy on milk are so high, as is clear from paragraph 29 of the present judgment, is the result of negligence on the part of the Italian Republic and the lack of effectiveness of the scheme implemented by that Member State to ensure the allocation and recovery of that levy within its territory during the period covered by the application.</p>

            <p>According to the Commission, in the first place, the implementation under national law of the EU's rules in this area has been excessively confusing, which has caused significant delays in the application of the national additional levy scheme and large-scale litigation. Consequently, the recovery of that levy has been made more difficult, in particular because of the suspension of payments awarded by certain national courts as a precautionary measure.</p>

            <p>In the second place, the Italian Republic has not made effective use of the administrative mechanisms which it could have used to recover the amounts due by way of the additional levy, in particular the compensation scheme. In Italy, the possibility of offsetting the amounts due under that heading and the amounts of aid to be paid in the context of the common agricultural policy have been introduced inefficiently and belatedly. Moreover, the Commission takes the view that some legislative provisions still in force hinder compensation being implemented.</p>

            <p>In the third place, the recovery procedures have been largely blocked since the entry into force of some legislative amendments introduced in the course of 2003, due to the absence of implementing provisions or conventional agreements between the authorities and the communities concerned which are necessary for the recovery procedures.</p>

In that regard the Commission states that the amounts payable have been wrongly considered to be irretrievable, which has also undermined the effectiveness of that recovery.</p>

Second, it contends that the Commission does not adduce evidence that the Italian Republic has infringed its obligations in connection with the allocation and recovery of the additional levy.</p>

With the passage of time, division and recovery of the additional levy is likely to become complicated or impossible for reasons such as the fact that undertakings may have ceased trading or accounting documents may have been lost (see, to that effect, judgments of 11 October 1990, Italy v Commission, C‑34/89, EU:C:1990:353, paragraph 12, and of 21 January 1999, Germany v Commission, C‑54/95, EU:C:1999:11, paragraph 177).</p>

            <p>In support of that argument, the Italian Republic relies on paragraph 36 of the judgment of 13 November 2001, France v Commission ( C‑277/98, EU:C:2001:603) in which the Court held that Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 1546/88 of 3 June 1988 laying down detailed rules for the application of the additional levy referred to in Article 5c of Regulation (EC) No 804/68 ( OJ 1988 L 139, p. 12), under which Member States are to adopt whatever measures are required to ensure collection of the additional levy, has created an obligation to use best endeavours and not an obligation to achieve a specific result.</p>

            <p>It therefore takes the view that the mere fact that part of the amounts relating to the additional levy on milk has not been recovered cannot suffice to establish the existence of the alleged infringement.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it appears that the arguments put forward by the Italian Republic are based on a misreading of the Commission's form of order sought. By its form of order sought, the Commission asks the Court to declare that the Italian Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations by failing, as pointed out in paragraph 27 of the present judgment, to take the necessary measures to ensure that the additional levy on milk is allocated to the producers concerned and, where appropriate, recovered by the competent authorities. Thus, the object of that infringement is not the fact that that Member State did not recover the entirety of the sums due by means of that levy.</p>

            <p>Although the Italian Republic devotes a large part of its pleadings to the detailed description of the national legal framework relating to the apportionment and recovery of the additional levy and its amendments, the Italian Republic does not, however, adduce any specific elements capable of calling into question the failure to act claimed by the Commission, or to demonstrate that it has, in accordance with its duty of care, implemented in time an effective scheme allowing it to recover the amounts concerned in accordance with the regulations referred to by the Commission.</p>

            <p>In that respect, it should be recalled that, even assuming that the implementation of EU rules on the milk levy has led to significant difficulties at the national level, the fact remains that, as the Court has repeatedly held, a Member State cannot plead practices or situations prevailing in its domestic legal order to justify failure to observe obligations arising under EU law (see, in particular, judgment of 2 March 2017, Commission v Greece, C‑160/16, not published, EU:C:2017:161, paragraph 13 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Moreover, although the Italian Republic considered that the EU rules on the additional levy on milk had, by their nature, impeded the allocation and, where appropriate, the recovery of that levy, in a prompt and effective manner, it would have been open to that Member State to bring actions before the Court for the purposes of a review of the legality of the relevant EU measures. Yet, throughout the contested period, which covers more than twelve years, no appeal to that effect was lodged by the Italian Republic. After all, the fact that the scheme for the additional levy on milk gave rise to legal and political difficulties at the EU level, and that the scheme was eventually replaced, in no way justifies the failure of Member States to take all the measures necessary to ensure its effectiveness at the national level.</p>

            <p>Moreover, with regard more particularly to Decision 2003/530, from which the Italian Republic infers that the Council of the European Union could not have adopted that decision had the Italian Republic failed to fulfil its obligations, it is sufficient to point out that the Council, by that decision, merely approved the aid measures designed to facilitate the payment of the additional levy by the milk producers concerned, without any assessment of the situation as it stood at the date of its adoption in Italy. In addition, by Decision 2003/530, the Council implicitly confirmed the obligation of the Italian Republic to ensure the payment of the additional levy by the milk producers and indicated, as is apparent from recital 7 of that decision, that `the Italian government [undertook] ... imposing the rigorous application of the additional levy on the basis of a new law.'</p>

            <p>It is also necessary to examine the Italian Republic's arguments that the present action for failure to fulfil obligations brought under Article 258 TFEU infringes the ne bis in idem, proportionality and specificity principles. It claims that, in so far as it has already paid the EAGGF the sums relating to the levy corresponding to the overrun of its national reference quantity, in accordance with Articles 3 and 4 of Regulation No 1788/2003, and, subsequently, with Articles 78 and 79 of Regulation No 1234/2007, that action would mean that it could be `penalised' again for the infringement of the same obligations relating to the allocation and, where appropriate, the recovery of the additional levy.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be recalled that, as is also apparent from recital 5 of Regulation No 1788/2003 and recital 38 of Regulation No 1234/2007, the provisions referred to in the preceding paragraph impose on the Italian Republic different obligations which relate, first, to the payment of the additional EAGGF levy to be borne by that Member State pursuant to Article 3 of Regulation No 1788/2003 and to Article 78(2) of Regulation No 1234/2007. Second, that Member State is required to divide the additional levy among the milk producers which contributed to the overrun of the national quotas and to recover it, in accordance with Article 4 of Regulation No 1788/2003 and with Article 79 of Regulation No 1234/2007. Thus, the fact that the Italian Republic eventually fulfilled the first of those obligations does not prevent it from having failed in the second of those obligations, which constitutes the sole subject matter of the present proceedings for failure to fulfil obligations.</p>

            <p>Such an assessment is all the more compelling since the Italian Republic's argument ultimately amounts to disregarding the purpose of the additional levy consisting in obliging milk producers to observe the reference quantities allocated to them (judgment of 25 March 2004, Cooperativa Lattepiù and Others, C‑231/00, C‑303/00 and C‑451/00, EU:C:2004:178, paragraph 75).</p>
