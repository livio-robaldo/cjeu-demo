            <p>On 11 July 2014, the Commission sent the Czech Republic a letter of formal notice, drawing that Member State's attention to the fact that certain provisions of its legislation relating to the definition of vehicle categories C1, C and D1, were not consistent with the requirements of Directive 2006/126.</p>

            <p>The Commission puts forward two heads of claim. By its first head of claim, it submits that, while the definitions of categories C1 and C explicitly state that they are `motor vehicles other than those in category D1 or D', Czech law did not include that criterion. Since that criterion is, however, used to establish correctly the necessary distinction between categories C1/C and D1/D, that omission would result, in the Member State concerned, in the holder of a category C1 or C driving licence being authorised to drive a vehicle constructed for the carriage of up to eight passengers, irrespective of the fact that the vehicle was designed for the carriage of passengers or goods, whereas Directive 2006/126 requires a category D1 or D driving licence if the vehicle is designed and constructed for the carriage of passengers.</p>

            <p>By its second head of claim, the Commission states that, while Article 4(4)(h) of Directive 2006/126 defines category D1 as covering motor vehicles `designed and constructed for the carriage of no more than 16 passengers in addition to the driver', Czech law, by imposing a lower limit of more than 8 passengers, introduced a further requirement, contrary to Article 4(4)(h) of that directive.</p>

            <p>In respect of its two heads of claim, the Commission states that, typically, category C covers motor vehicles intended for the carriage of goods while category D covers motor vehicles intended for the carriage of passengers. However, that does not preclude category C motor vehicles from also being used for the carriage of passengers. The passengers contemplated, in the event thereof, are in particular the members of the team carried mainly for the purposes of handling the load, rather than passengers travelling from point A to point B.</p>

          <content eId="para_13456__content">
            <p>Since certain technical characteristics of categories C and C1 are identical to those of categories D1 and D, the Commission stresses the need to accurately define categories C1 and C, on the one hand, and categories D1 and D, on the other. The definition chosen in that respect by Directive 2006/126, namely the words `other than those in category D1 or D' in the definition of categories C1 and C, therefore means that cars which meet the technical criteria of categories C1/C and D1/D but which are primarily used for the carriage of passengers, fall within categories D1 and D, whereas vehicles not belonging to categories D1 and D fall within categories C1 and C.</p>

With regard to categories D and D1, while maintaining the lower limit of more than 8 passengers for category D, Directive 2006/126 abolished that same limit for category D1, with the result that, for the latter category, the sole upper limit of 16 passengers applies.</p>

Those vehicles, in so far as they are designed and constructed for the carriage of up to eight passengers in addition to the driver and provided that their maximum length does not exceed 8 metres, now fall within a category that is appropriate, having regard to their technical characteristics and their typical use, namely category D1.</p>

In addition, by virtue of the words `other than those in category D1 or D', by which that directive defines categories C/C1 and D/D1 respectively, such vehicles, since they fall within category D1, do not, in any circumstances, fall, under EU law, within category C1.</p>

            <p>First, that Member State argues that EU law does not require Member States to undertake a literal transposition of the definitions laid down by Directive 2006/126, provided that the objective pursued by the directive is achieved.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be recalled that it is settled case-law that transposing a directive into national law does not necessarily require its provisions to be reproduced verbatim in an express, specific law or regulation; a general legal context may be sufficient, provided that it does effectively ensure the full application of the directive in a sufficiently clear and precise manner (judgment of 30 June 2016, Commission v Poland, C‑648/13, EU:C:2016:490, paragraph 73 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>However, as is apparent from paragraphs 29 to 32 of the present judgment, the national provisions relied on by the Czech Republic do not make it possible to attain the result pursued by Article 4(1) and (4)(d), (f) and (h) of Directive 2006/126. In those circumstances, the argument that a literal transposition is not mandatory is ineffective in the context of the present case.</p>

            <p>Secondly, the Czech Republic argues that it drew up a definition, at national level, of vehicle categories C1, C, and D1, which is precise, understandable and, in practice, unlikely to give rise to dispute. Assuming that no car should fall within several categories, that Member State takes the view that this objective may be achieved in two ways, namely, either by establishing the definition of a category negatively compared to other categories, the solution adopted in Directive 2006/126, or by defining individual categories so that they do not overlap, which is the solution that the Czech legislature adopted by setting a lower limit for the number of passengers that category D1 vehicles may carry.</p>

          <content eId="para_13477__content">
            <p>In that regard, it is sufficient to note that, as the Czech Republic itself concedes, in order to implement that definition, it included in the national definition of category D1 a condition which does not, however, appear in Article 4(4)(h) of Directive 2006/126, in which EU law defines that category. As noted in paragraphs 29 to 32 of the present judgment, the existence of that additional condition leads to differences in how that directive is applied in the Czech Republic compared to other Member States when determining the category within which a vehicle falls, and, accordingly, the type of driving licence required for that vehicle.</p>

            <p>Therefore, choosing a method of definition that generates such differences with what is required by EU law does not, in any event, amount to a complete and correct transposition of Directive 2006/126.</p>

          <content eId="para_13479__content">
            <p>Thirdly, the Czech Republic argues that vehicles falling within category D1 are a subset of category D, as is apparent from the name given to category D1 and the legislative history of the definitions of the categories at EU level. It is an `abridged' version of category D, and the category D1 vehicles thus cover a specific section of category D vehicles which, in the light of their characteristics, require only an abridged version of the category D driving licence. Since the lower limit relating to the number of persons who may be carried appears in the definition of category D, it should be reproduced in Category D1.</p>

            <p>In that respect, it should be noted that, while Article 3(2) of Directive 91/439 had intended category D1 to be a subcategory of category D, as evidenced by the words `within categories A, B, B + E, C, C + E, D and D + E, a specific driving licence may be issued for the driving of vehicles in the following subcategories', those terms do not, however, appear in the definitions of the driving licence categories laid down in Article 4(4) of Directive 2006/126. The fact that, for example, category D1 includes vehicles not falling under category D, like the implications entailed by the categorisation of the different driving licences, is therefore a choice that the EU legislature made and whose usefulness may not be called into question in the context of the present action for failure to fulfil obligations.</p>

          <content eId="para_13481__content">
            <p>Fourthly, the Czech Republic argues that, in the absence of the lower limit of more than 8 passengers provided for in Czech law, category D1, in that it includes cars up to 8 metres in length which can carry up to 16 passengers, de facto incorporates categories C1 and C. It might even be considered that the driving of a lorry less than 8 metres in length requires a category D1 driving licence, and that a category C1 driving licence is required only where the lorry's length exceeds 8 metres.</p>

            <p>In that respect, it should be noted that, as regards categories C/C1 and D1, the definition of a motor vehicle, apart from the factors relating to the number of passengers, mass and length, is identical for those categories, in particular in that those motor vehicles are `designed and constructed for the carriage of ... passengers'.</p>
