Second, it annulled Article 2(h) and (i) of the 2007 decision in so far as it concerned [Toshiba], on the ground that the Commission had infringed the principle of equal treatment by choosing, when calculating the fine, a reference year for [Toshiba] which was different from that chosen for the European participants in the infringement.</p>

            <p>By [the decision at issue], Article 2 of the 2007 decision was amended by the addition of two new points, (h) and (i). Under Article 2(h), a fine of EUR 4650000 was imposed on [Toshiba], to be paid jointly and severally with [Mitsubishi]. Under Article 2(i), a fine of EUR 56793000 was imposed on [Toshiba], for which it was solely liable.</p>

            <p>In order to remedy the unequal treatment criticised by the Court in its judgment [of 12 July 2011, Toshiba v Commission ( T‑113/07, EU:T:2011:343)], the Commission used, in [the decision at issue], the worldwide turnover for GIS products in 2003. In so far as, in that year, the GIS activities of [Toshiba] and of [Mitsubishi] were carried out by TM T&amp;D, the Commission took into consideration that company's turnover in 2003 (recitals 59 and 60 of the [decision at issue]).</p>

            <p>Thus, first, in the context of the differential treatment aimed at reflecting the respective contributions of the various participants in the cartel, the Commission calculated TM T&amp;D's GIS market share in 2003 (15% to 20%) and placed it in the second group in accordance with the categorisation established in recitals 482 to 488 of the 2007 decision. Consequently, a hypothetical starting amount of EUR 31000000 was allocated to TM T&amp;D (recital 61 of the [decision at issue]).</p>

          <content eId="para_12349__content">
            <p>Second, in order to reflect the [Toshiba's] and [Mitsubishi's] unequal capacity to contribute to the infringement during the period prior to the creation of TM T&amp;D, the starting amount determined for the latter was divided between its shareholders in accordance with their respective GIS sales in 2001, which was the last full year prior to the creation of TM T&amp;D. Consequently, starting amounts of EUR 10863199 and EUR 20136801 were allocated to [Toshiba] and [Mitsubishi] respectively (recitals 62 and 63 of the [decision at issue]).</p>

          <content eId="para_12350__content">
            <p>Third, in order to ensure the deterrent effect of the fine, the Commission applied a deterrence multiplier of 2 to [Toshiba], on the basis of its turnover in 2005 (recitals 69 to 71 of the [decision at issue]).</p>

            <p>Fourth, with a view to reflecting the duration of the infringement during the period prior to the creation of TM T&amp;D, the starting amount attributed to [Toshiba] was increased by 140% (recitals 73 to 76 of the [decision at issue]).</p>

            <p>Fifth, in order to reflect the duration of the infringement during TM T&amp;D's period of operation, a sum corresponding to 15% of the hypothetical starting amount of TM T&amp;D was imposed on [Toshiba] and [Mitsubishi] jointly and severally (recital 77 of the [decision at issue]).</p>

            <p>By its first ground of appeal, Toshiba complains that the General Court dismissed, in paragraphs 34 to 47 of the judgment under appeal, the first part of the second plea in its action by which it argued that, following the judgment of the General Court of 12 July 2011, Toshiba v Commission ( T‑113/07, EU:T:2011:343), the Commission was required to send it a new statement of objections prior to the adoption of the decision at issue and that, by merely sending it a letter of facts, the Commission breached its rights of defence and, in particular, its right to be heard.</p>

            <p>In Toshiba's view, the statement of objections of 20 April 2006 ( `2006 statement of objections') relates only to the 2007 decision. The General Court was therefore wrong to find, in paragraph 42 of the judgment under appeal, that the fact that the decision at issue amended the 2007 decision means that the procedure for the adoption of the decision at issue `amounts to an extension of the procedure which led to the 2007 decision'.</p>

            <p>As the General Court rightly stated, in paragraph 74 of the judgment under appeal, in relation to the imposition of the additional amount of the fine, the Commission was in particular obliged to provide Toshiba with additional information as to how it intended to ensure the deterrent effect of the fine, so as to enable it to make known its views. However, that statement cannot be reconciled with the finding, contained in the same paragraph of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission was not obliged to send it a new statement of objections containing those elements.</p>

            <p>Toshiba argues that, given that the letter of facts does not have any particular procedural status, as the General Court noted in paragraph 75 of the judgment under appeal, and that the statement of objections is the only procedural mechanism foreseen in EU competition law for providing it the necessary information in a manner that ensured that it had an opportunity to be heard by the Commission, respect of its right to be heard in respect of the calculation of the fine the Commission had intended to impose on it required in the circumstances a new statement of objections to be sent.</p>

            <p>Last, paragraph 74 of the judgment under appeal is vitiated by an error of law. The case-law cited by the General Court concerned only the requirement that an undertaking under investigation must have been afforded the opportunity, during the administrative procedure, to make known its views on the truth and relevance of the facts and circumstances alleged and on the documents used by the Commission to support its claim that there has been an infringement of the rules of the FEU Treaty in the area of competition. However, that case-law does not concern the calculation of the fine imposed following the finding of such an infringement.</p>

            <p>In so far as, by its first ground of appeal, Toshiba essentially criticises the General Court for having rejected its line of argument that the Commission could not adopt the decision at issue without sending it a new statement of objection, arguing, in particular, that, contrary to what the General Court held, the procedure leading to the adoption of the decision at issue did not amount to an extension of the procedure which led to the 2007 decision, it is clearly not a new ground of appeal.</p>

            <p>As regards the merits, the General Court was right, in paragraphs 40 and 41 of the judgment under appeal, to rely on the principle, established in the settled case-law of the Court, that, in order to fulfil its obligation to respect the right of undertakings to be heard, the Commission is required to indicate expressly in the statement of objections that it will consider whether it is appropriate to impose fines on the undertakings concerned and to set out the principal elements of fact and of law that may give rise to a fine, such as the gravity and the duration of the alleged infringement and whether it has been committed intentionally or negligently. It is also apparent from that case-law that the Commission is not, however, required, once it has indicated the main factual and legal criteria on which it will base its calculation of the amount of the fines, to specify the way in which it will use each of those elements in order to determine their level (see, inter alia, judgment of 28 June 2005, Dansk Rørindustri and Others v Commission, C‑189/02 P, C‑202/02 P, C‑205/02 P to C‑208/02 P and C‑213/02 P, EU:C:2005:408, paragraphs 428 and 437).</p>

            <p>The General Court was also right to consider, in paragraph 42 of the judgment under appeal, that, given that the adoption of the 2007 decision was preceded by the 2006 statement of objections and that the decision at issue states explicitly that it constitutes a decision which amends the 2007 decision, its adoption procedure amounts to an extension of the procedure which led to the 2007 decision.</p>

            <p>The General Court was consequently entitled to conclude, in the same paragraph of the judgment under appeal, without erring in law, that the content of the 2006 statement of objections may be taken into consideration in assessing whether Toshiba's rights of defence were respected in the procedure which led to the adoption of the decision at issue, in so far as that content was not called into question in the judgment of the General Court of 12 July 2011, Toshiba v Commission ( T‑113/07, EU:T:2011:343).</p>

The annulment of the act does not, in principle, affect the validity of the measures preparatory to that measure, which were taken before the stage at which the defect was observed. If it is found that the annulment does not affect the validity of the prior procedural measures, the Commission is not, as a result of that annulment alone, required to present the undertakings concerned with a new statement of objections (see, to that effect, judgment of 15 October 2002, Limburgse Vinyl Maatschappij and Others v Commission, C‑238/99 P, C‑244/99 P, C‑245/99 P, C‑247/99 P, C‑250/99 P to C‑252/99 P and C‑254/99 P, EU:C:2002:582, paragraphs 73 to 75 and 80 and 81).</p>

            <p>It should also be pointed out that, in response to Toshiba's argument that the defect identified concerned a substantive error of law which inevitably affected the validity of the measures preparatory to the 2007 decision, the General Court found, in paragraph 62 of the judgment under appeal, that Toshiba had failed to state how exactly those measures were vitiated by the judgment of the General Court of 12 July 2011, Toshiba v Commission ( T‑113/07, EU:T:2011:343), and added, in paragraph 63 of the judgment under appeal, that, in any event, the General Court's criticism in that judgment of 12 July 2011 did not pertain to the identification of facts and the legal assessment of the infringement committed by Toshiba or to the determination of the factors to be taken into account when calculating the fine, but merely to the choice of reference data to be used for the detailed calculation and consequently to an element which did not have to be set out in the statement of objections.</p>

            <p>It follows that the General Court, in the exercise of its, in principle, exclusive jurisdiction to assess the facts and evidence, found, without Toshiba having invoked any distortion of that evidence, that Toshiba had not shown that the annulment by the judgment of the General Court of 12 July 2011, Toshiba v Commission ( T‑113/07, EU:T:2011:343) of the 2007 decision affected the validity of the 2006 statement of objections and that that was moreover not the case given that the defect identified did not concern the objections raised against Toshiba or the factors to be taken into account when calculating the amount of its fine.</p>

            <p>That conclusion cannot be called into question, contrary to what Toshiba argues, in the light of the principle said to arise from the case-law cited in paragraph 71 of the judgment under appeal and on the basis of which the General Court concluded, in paragraph 74 of that judgment, that the Commission was required, following the communication of the statement of objections, to provide the undertaking concerned with additional information as to how it intended to ensure the deterrent effect of the fine, so as to enable it properly to make known its views in that regard.</p>

Second, it argued that the Commission should have calculated the starting amount of the fine imposed on it on the basis of its 2003 turnover, that is to say, by assigning it 35% of the turnover achieved by TM T&amp;D in 2003.</p>

            <p>Thus, in examining, in paragraphs 139 to 141 of the judgment under appeal, the issue of the conformity with the principle of equal treatment of the determination of the amount of the fine imposed on Toshiba in view of the gravity of the infringement alleged against it compared to that found for the European producers, the General Court did not disregard the fact that the judgment of 12 July 2011, Toshiba v Commission ( T‑113/07, EU:T:2011:343) is res judicata.</p>

            <p>[As rectified by order of 12 July 2017] In paragraphs 141 and 142 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court held, without erring in law, that, given that the participation of the Japanese undertakings in the common understanding was a `prerequisite' for the effective implementation of the EQ Agreement in which only the European undertakings participated and that the Japanese undertakings' honouring of their commitments therefore made a `necessary contribution' to the functioning of the infringement, it had to be concluded that Toshiba's contribution to the infringement was comparable to that of the European undertakings.</p>

            <p>[As rectified by order of 12 July 2017] Furthermore, in paragraph 141 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court referred to paragraph 261 of the judgment of 12 July 2011, Toshiba v Commission ( T‑113/07, EU:T:2011:343), in which the General Court also rightly held that, since Toshiba undertook under the common understanding not to operate on the EEA market, its participation also in the EQ Agreement -- whose purpose was the sharing of GIS projects on the EEA market -- was unnecessary. The fact that Toshiba did not participate in the EQ Agreement was irrelevant and not the result of its choice.</p>

            <p>[As rectified by order of 12 July 2017] In other words, as the Advocate General noted in point 134 of his Opinion, the General Court correctly held that the fact that Toshiba did not participate in the EQ Agreement was a mere consequence of its participation in the common understanding and thus does not mean that its conduct was less serious than that of the European producers.</p>
