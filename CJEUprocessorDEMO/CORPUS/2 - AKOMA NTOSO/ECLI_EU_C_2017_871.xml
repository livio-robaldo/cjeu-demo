            <p>Article II.30 of the general conditions is drafted as follows: `Without prejudice to any other measures provided for in this [agreement], the contractors agree that the [Union], with the aim of protecting its financial interests, is entitled to claim liquidated damages from a contractor who is found to have overstated expenditure and who has consequently received an unjustified financial contribution from the [Union]. Liquidated damages are due in addition to the recovery of the unjustified financial contribution from the contractor. 1. Any amount of liquidated damages shall be proportionate to the overstated expenditure and unjustified portion of the [Union] contribution. The following formula shall be used to calculate any possible liquidated damages: Liquidated damages = unjustified financial contribution × (overstated expenditure/total claimed) The calculation of any liquidated damages shall only take into consideration the period relating to the contractor's claim for the [Union] contribution for that period. It shall not be calculated in relation to the entire [Union] contribution. 2. The Commission shall inform the contractor which it considers liable to pay liquidated damages in writing of its claim by way of a registered letter with acknowledgement of receipt. The contractor shall have a period of 30 days to answer the [Union's] claim. 3. The procedure for repayment of unjustified financial contribution and for payment of liquidated damages will be determined in accordance with the provisions of Article II.31. 4. The Commission shall be entitled to compensation in respect of any overstated expenditure which comes to light after the agreement has been completed, in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 1 to 6. 5. These provisions shall be without prejudice to any administrative or financial sanctions that the Commission may impose on any defaulting contractor in accordance with the Financial Regulation or to any other civil remedy to which the [Union] or any other contractor may be entitled. Furthermore, these provisions shall not preclude any criminal proceedings which may be initiated by the Member States' authorities. 6. Further, as established by the Financial Regulation, any contractor declared to be in grave breach of its contractual obligations shall be liable to financial penalties of between 2% and 10% of the value of the [Union's] financial contribution received by that contractor. The rate may be increased to between 4% and 20% in the event of a repeated breach in the five years following the first breach.'</p>

By its second plea in law, the appellant alleged that the Commission had, wrongly, claimed that it had benefited under the HyWays project from a financial contribution in the amount of EUR 604240.79. The third plea in law concerned the erroneous character of the reclassification of certain costs incurred in the context of the agreement relating to the HyApproval project.

            <p>It should be borne in mind that the duty to state reasons established by Article 296 TFEU is an essential procedural requirement which must be distinguished from the question whether the reasoning is well founded, which is concerned with the substantive legality of the measure at issue. The reasoning of a decision consists in a formal statement of the grounds on which that decision is based. If those grounds are vitiated by errors, the latter will vitiate the substantive legality of the decision, but not the statement of reasons in it, which may be adequate even though it sets out reasons which are incorrect. It follows that objections and arguments intended to establish that a measure is not well founded are irrelevant in the context of a ground of appeal alleging an inadequate statement of reasons or a lack of such a statement (judgment of 18 June 2015, Ipatau v Council, C‑535/14 P, EU:C:2015:407, paragraph 37 and the case-law cited).</p>

According to the General Court, it `follows that the basis serving as denominator is smaller than that constituted by all the hours of work and that, consequently, the hourly rate is higher', so that `once applied to the hours actually worked in the context of the projects, it results in a costs declaration of a higher amount'.</p>

In an appeal, the Court's jurisdiction is, as a general rule, confined to a review of the assessment by the General Court of the pleas argued before it. However, an argument which was not raised at first instance does not constitute a new plea that is inadmissible at the appeal stage if it is simply an amplification of an argument already developed in the context of a plea set out in the application before the General Court (judgment of 28 July 2016 in Tomana and Others v Council and Commission, C‑330/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:601, paragraphs 33 and the case-law cited).</p>

It states, in that respect, that the General Court noted, in paragraph 46 of that judgment, `that eligible costs [could] not result in the contractor making a profit'. First, the appellant had alleged, in the context of its action at first instance, that its calculation method did not result in it making a profit, but could, on the contrary, at most result in covering its costs linked to the projects, whereas the Commission's calculation method resulted in significant losses for it.

            <p>By its fourth ground of appeal, the appellant maintains that the General Court infringed Articles 1162, 1134 and 1135 of the Belgian Civil Code, by holding, in paragraph 61 of the judgment under appeal, that the interpretation of Article II.19 to II.21 of the general conditions was clear as regards the contested method of determining costs and that there was, accordingly, no need to refer to the principles of Belgian civil law.</p>

            <p>It claims, in that regard, that it was for the Commission to state clearly, and before the conclusion of the agreements at issue, the detailed rules for determining costs. It claims that since those clarifications were not provided, the agreements were imprecise on that point. They should, therefore, have been interpreted in the light of the aforementioned Belgian provisions, which provide that, in the event of a doubt regarding the interpretation of an agreement, that agreement should be interpreted to the disadvantage of the party who stipulated it and in favour of the party which contracted the obligation, and that the parties to the contract are under an obligation to perform agreements in good faith. According to the appellant, the General Court should have found that the hourly rate calculation method which it suggested was compatible with the general conditions of the agreements at issue and the aforementioned provisions of the Belgian Civil Code. It claims that, in these circumstances, the General Court should have considered the contested debit notes as contrary to the agreements and, therefore, unlawful.</p>

            <p>By its fourth ground of appeal, the appellant complains, in essence, in paragraphs 61 of the contested decision, that the General Court did not apply Articles 1162, 1134 and 1135 of the Belgian Civil Code, on the ground that the definition of the eligible indirect and direct costs in Articles II.19 to II.21 of the general conditions was clear and, accordingly, there was no need to apply the Belgian civil law principles of contract interpretation.</p>

            <p>By the second part of that ground, the appellant complains that the General Court failed to consider the question of the invalidity of Article II.30 of the general conditions, although, in its view, that Article infringes Articles 1172 and 1231 of the Belgian Civil Code. The appellant acknowledges that the General Court limited the consequences of the application of Article II.30 of the general conditions. To that effect, it considered, first, in paragraph 94 of the judgment under appeal, that that Article could not apply to the mere harm linked to the delay in repayment of the unduly paid advances. It applied, second, the possibility set out in Article 1231 of the Belgian Civil Code of restricting the amount of the liquidated damages that the Commission is entitled to claim to 10% of the amount of the advances to be repaid. In doing so, the General Court reduced the amounts to repay, whilst maintaining the applicability of Article II.30 of the general conditions to the present case. The appellant claims that the General Court should have held Article II.30 to be invalid on the ground that it is contrary to Article 1172 of the Belgian Civil Code and, therefore, held that the appellant was not under an obligation to pay any damages.</p>

            <p>The appellant refers, in that regard, to the settled case-law in the field of unfair terms in respect of consumers, according to which the Court considered that the competent court cannot reduce unfair general conditions of a contract to the part of them that is still valid, but must, on the contrary, exclude their application to the other party to the contract (judgment of 14 June 2012, Banco Español de Crédito, C‑618/10, EU:C:2012:349, paragraph 58 et seq.). The appellant considers that that case-law can be applied to the present case in that it is, like consumers, the weaker party to the EU's grant agreement, upon which the Commission's contractual general conditions are imposed, with no ability to negotiate them.</p>

            <p>As regards the first part of the fifth ground of appeal, alleging a failure to state reasons, it must be recalled, that, according to settled case-law, in the context of an appeal, first, the purpose of review by the Court of Justice is, inter alia, to consider whether the General Court addressed, to the requisite legal standard, all the arguments raised by the appellant and, secondly, that a plea alleging that the General Court failed to rule on arguments relied on at first instance amounts essentially to pleading a breach of the obligation to state reasons which derives from Article 36 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union, applicable to the General Court by virtue of the first paragraph of Article 53 of that statute, and Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court (judgment of 11 May 2017, Dyson v Commission, C‑44/16 P, EU:C:2017:357, paragraph 37 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In that regard, it follows from the Court's settled case-law that the General Court's duty to state reasons does not require it to provide an account which follows exhaustively and one by one all the arguments put forward by the parties to the case, and that the General Court's reasoning may therefore be implicit, on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why it has not upheld their arguments and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its power of review (judgment of 11 May 2017, Dyson v Commission, C‑44/16 P, EU:C:2017:357, paragraph 38, and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the present case, the General Court, in paragraph 79 of the judgment under appeal, rejected, as manifestly unfounded, the appellant's argument alleging a contradiction between Article II.30 of the general conditions and the accepted principles of morality protected by Article 1172 of the Belgian Civil Code.

            <p>Whilst it is true that the appellant's claim was rejected as being `manifestly' unfounded, it remains the case that the rejection of an argument relied on by an appellant, however manifest, does not exonerate the General Court from its duty to state reasons for its decision. The General Court therefore vitiated its assessment by a failure to state sufficient reasons; it is not, however, in the present case, such as to result in the annulment of the judgment under appeal.</p>

            <p>As the General Court indicated in paragraph 76 of the judgment under appeal, the examination of the fourth head of claim, relating to the liquidated damages, entailed checking whether the Commission's application of that point in the circumstances of the present case complied with the rules of the Belgian Civil Code regulating the use of penalty clauses. Since the Belgian law, applicable to the contested grant agreements, provides for the use of those clauses and such a penalty clause has the effect, in accordance with Article 1229 of the Belgian Civil Code and, as the General Court noted, in paragraphs 81 and 82 of the judgment under appeal, of compensating for the delay in performance of the main obligation or its non-performance, the penalty clause set out in Article II.30 of the general conditions cannot, consequently, be considered as illegal or contrary to the accepted principles of morality.</p>
