            <p>The defendants in those proceedings argued that legal proceedings could not be brought against them, basing that argument on the fact that, at the time of the accident, a valid insurance contract was in place, concluded with the company now known as Fidelidade-Companhia de Seguros ( `the insurer'), which covered civil liability in respect of the motor vehicle concerned. Called on to join the proceedings, that company maintained that the contract for motor vehicle insurance against civil liability was not valid, on the ground that the policyholder concerned had made a false statement on the date the contract was concluded, claiming to be both the owner of the vehicle and its usual driver.</p>

            <p>The court hearing the case at first instance ruled that the insurance contract was not valid and that that invalidity could be invoked against the victims. Hearing the case on appeal, the Tribunal da Relação do Porto (Court of Appeal, Porto, Portugal) ruled that the contract was not valid, but that that invalidity could not be invoked against the victims. The insurer lodged an appeal on a point of law against the judgment of the Tribunal da Relação do Porto (Court of Appeal, Porto) before the Supremo Tribunal de Justiça (Supreme Court, Portugal), claiming that the insurance contract in question was null and void and that that nullity could be invoked against both the victim -- Mr Seemann -- and the Caisse Suisse de Compensation.</p>

            <p>Regarding the interpretation of the First, Second and Third Directives on motor vehicle insurance, the referring court considers that there are doubts as to whether the nullity of the insurance contract, as referred to in Article 428(1) of the Portuguese Commercial Code, may be invoked against the victims.</p>

          <content eId="para_13963__content">
            <p>Indeed, there are differences of interpretation in the case-law of the Supremo Tribunal de Justiça (Supreme Court). One line of case-law has ruled to the effect that the insurance contract is rendered null and void when the policyholder falsely states that he is the owner and usual driver of the vehicle concerned, with the aim of inducing the insurer to conclude an insurance contract against civil liability and/or concluding such a contract on conditions which are less onerous for the insured person. That nullity is based, inter alia, on the fact that the legal condition relating to the policyholder's `interest', required by Article 428(1) of the Portuguese Commercial Code, is not met. Pursuant to Article 14 of Decree-Law No 522/85, such nullity may, according to that line of case-law, be invoked against the victim. That approach takes account of the fact that the victim will always be protected via the Fundo de Garantia Automóvel.</p>

          <content eId="para_13964__content">
            <p>According to the second line of case-law, the possibility that a contract for compulsory motor vehicle insurance against civil liability may be concluded by a third party constitutes a derogation from the legal condition relating to the policyholder's `interest'. Consequently, the issue should be resolved in the light of the specific regime applicable to false statements made in the context of the conclusion of an insurance contract, which is that of relative nullity only, which may not be invoked against a victim.</p>

            <p>By its question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 3(1) of the First Directive, Article 2(1) of the Second Directive and Article 1 of the Third Directive are to be interpreted as precluding national legislation which would have the effect of making it possible to invoke against third-party victims, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, the nullity of a contract for motor vehicle insurance against civil liability arising as a result of the policyholder initially making false statements concerning the identity of the owner and of the usual driver of the vehicle concerned or from the fact that the person for whom or on whose behalf that insurance contract was concluded had no economic interest in the conclusion of that contract.</p>

            <p>It should be borne in mind that, according to the preambles to the First and Second Directives, the aim of those directives is, first, to ensure the free movement of vehicles normally based in the territory of the European Union and of persons travelling in those vehicles and, second, to guarantee that the victims of accidents caused by those vehicles receive comparable treatment irrespective of where in the European Union the accident occurred (judgment of 23 October 2012, Marques Almeida, C‑300/10, EU:C:2012:656, paragraph 26 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>To those ends, Article 3(1) of the First Directive, as amplified and supplemented by the Second and Third Directives, requires the Member States to ensure that civil liability in respect of the use of motor vehicles normally based in their territory is covered by insurance, and specifies, inter alia, the types of damage and the third-party victims to be covered by that insurance (judgment of 1 December 2011, Churchill Insurance Company Limited and Evans, C‑442/10, EU:C:2011:799, paragraph 28).</p>

            <p>As regards the rights granted to third-party victims, Article 3(1) of the First Directive precludes a company insuring against civil liability in respect of the use motor vehicles from relying on statutory provisions or contractual clauses in order to refuse to compensate those victims for an accident caused by the insured vehicle (judgment of 1 December 2011, Churchill Insurance Company Limited and Evans, C‑442/10, EU:C:2011:799, paragraph 33 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>The Court has also held that the first subparagraph of Article 2(1) of the Second Directive simply repeats that obligation, with respect to statutory provisions or contractual clauses in an insurance policy referred to in that article which exclude from the cover provided by motor vehicle insurance against civil liability damage or injury suffered by third-party victims as a result of the use or driving of an insured vehicle by persons not authorised to drive the vehicle, persons not holding a driving licence, or persons in breach of the statutory technical requirements concerning the condition and safety of that vehicle (judgment of 1 December 2011, Churchill Insurance Company Limited and Evans, C‑442/10, EU:C:2011:799, paragraph 34 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It is true that, by way of derogation from that obligation, the second subparagraph of Article 2(1) of the Second Directive provides that certain victims may be excluded from compensation by the insurance company, having regard to the situation they have themselves brought about, that is to say, persons who voluntarily entered the vehicle which caused the damage or injury, when that company can prove that they knew the vehicle had been stolen. However, and as the Court has already held, derogations from the first subparagraph of Article 2(1) of the Second Directive may be made only in that single, specific case (judgment of 1 December 2011, Churchill Insurance Company Limited and Evans, C‑442/10, EU:C:2011:799, paragraph 35).</p>

            <p>Accordingly, it must be held that the fact that the insurance company has concluded that contract on the basis of omissions or false statements on the part of the policyholder does not enable the company to rely on statutory provisions regarding the nullity of the contract or to invoke that nullity against a third-party victim so as to be released from its obligation under Article 3(1) of the First Directive to compensate that victim for an accident caused by the insured vehicle.</p>

            <p>Indeed, the Court has held that the fact that a vehicle is driven by a person not named in the insurance policy relating to that vehicle cannot, in view, in particular, of the aim pursued by the First, Second and Third Directives of protecting victims of road traffic accidents, support the conclusion that that vehicle is uninsured for the purposes of the third subparagraph of Article 1(4) of the Second Directive (judgment of 1 December 2011, Churchill Insurance Company Limited and Evans, C‑442/10, EU:C:2011:799, paragraph 40).</p>

            <p>In that context, the referring court also asks the Court whether an insurance company is entitled to rely, in the case of an ongoing contract for compulsory motor vehicle insurance against civil liability and in order to avoid its obligation to compensate third-party victims of an accident caused by the insured vehicle, on a statutory provision, such as Article 428(1) of the Portuguese Commercial Code, which provides for the nullity of an insurance contract in the event that the person for whom or on whose behalf the insurance has been taken out has no economic interest in the conclusion of that contract.</p>

            <p>Those States are nonetheless obliged to ensure that the civil liability arising under their domestic law is covered by insurance which complies with the provisions of the three abovementioned directives. It is also apparent from the Court's case-law that the Member States must exercise their powers in that field in a way that is consistent with EU law and that the provisions of national legislation which govern compensation for road accidents may not deprive the First, Second and Third Directives of their effectiveness (judgment of 23 October 2012, Marques Almeida, C‑300/10, EU:C:2012:656, paragraphs 30 and 31 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>That finding is not called in question by the fact that it is possible for the victim to receive compensation from the Fundo de Garantia Automóvel. The payment of compensation by the body referred to in Article 1(4) of the Second Directive was, in fact, designed to be a measure of last resort, envisaged only for cases in which the vehicle that caused the injury or damage has not satisfied the requirement for insurance referred to in Article 3(1) of the First Directive, that is to say, it is a vehicle in respect of which no insurance contract is in place. Such a restriction is explained by the fact that that provision, as recalled in paragraph 23 of the present judgment, requires each Member State to ensure, subject to the derogations allowed under Article 4 of the First Directive, that every owner or keeper of a vehicle normally based in its territory concludes a contract with an insurance company in order to guarantee, up to the limits established by EU law, his civil liability arising as a result of the use of that vehicle (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 July 2013, Csonka and Others, C‑409/11, EU:C:2013:512, paragraphs 30 and 31).</p>
