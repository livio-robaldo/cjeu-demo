            <p>Iberdrola is a private investor who purchased several parcels of land in that holiday village in order to construct buildings containing approximately 300 apartments for seasonal use.

            <p>Following completion of the works, the buildings which Iberdrola planned to construct in the holiday village could be connected to the pump station. The Varhoven administrativen sad (Supreme Administrative Court, Bulgaria) refers to an expert opinion which states that, without that reconstruction, the connection would be impossible since the existing sewer system is insufficient.</p>

            <p>The costs indicated on the invoice for the reconstruction of the pump station were listed in Iberdrola's accounts as `deferred expenditure', as expenditure for the acquisition of tangible fixed assets, and in its profit and loss account as stocks for 2009 and 2010. According to the expert, there is a link between the supplies indicated on the invoice and the goods and services which Iberdrola must supply after the construction of the authorised buildings on its parcels of land.</p>

            <p>The Bulgarian tax authority took the view that Iberdrola could not deduct input VAT of BGN 147635 (Bulgarian leva) (approximately EUR 74284) and sent Iberdrola an adjusted tax notice and an amended adjusted tax notice.</p>

            <p>The Administrativen sad Sofia (Administrative Court, Sofia) however annulled those notices. It took the view that the municipality of Tsarevo benefited from the supply of services free of charge consisting of the completion of the works to reconstruct the pump station. However, the fact that the supply of services was free of charge did not justify, according to that court, the application of Article 70(1)(2) of the ZDDS, given that those services were used in the context of Iberdrola's economic activity, namely the connection of the buildings for which a building permit had been granted to the pump station. According to the Administrativen sad Sofia (Administrative Court, Sofia), if the right to deduct input VAT in respect of a supply of services were to be recognised, the expenditure incurred for that purpose must form part of the general costs of the taxable person and constitute a component of the price of those services. It is irrelevant whether the works carried out relate to a property belonging to the municipality.</p>

            <p>The referring court makes references to two judgments of the Court, delivered in cases also centring on Article 70(2) of the ZDDS, namely the judgment of 16 February 2012, Eon Aset Menidjmunt ( Câ€‘118/11, EU:C:2012:97), and the judgment of 22 March 2012Klub ( Câ€‘153/11, EU:C:2012:163). The referring court indicates however that those judgments led to conflicting interpretations by the national courts.</p>

          <content eId="para_17569__content">
            <p>According to certain courts, despite the fact that the works were carried out free of charge, the fact that the work relates to the property of the municipality and does not constitute therefore an asset of the undertaking prevents the deduction of input VAT. According to other courts, on the other hand, the listing of the costs incurred for the works in the general costs of the undertaking and the use of the pump station in the context of the activity of the undertaking gives rise to a right to deduct.</p>

          <content eId="para_17570__content">
            <p>Moreover, the referring court indicates that, according to the national provision at issue in the main proceedings, the fact that a supply of services is provided free of charge is sufficient by itself to refuse to recognise the right to deduct input VAT, and, consequently, is independent of whether the services in question are used in the context of the economic activity of the recipient of the services or for purposes other than those relating to the recipient's undertaking. The referring court points out however the difference between that provision and Article 26(1)(b) of Directive 2006/112, which subjects the refusal of the right to deduct to the dual condition that the supply of those services is free of charge and that they are used for purposes other than the activity of the undertaking.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the Varhoven administrativen sad (Administrative Supreme Court, Bulgaria) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling: `</p>

          <content eId="para_17572__content">
            <p>It should be noted, first of all, that the dispute in the main proceedings and the questions referred by the referring court relate to the scope of the right to deduct laid down by Directive 2006/112 and, more specifically, by Article 168(a) thereof.</p>

            <p>To the extent that the questions referred relate to Article 176 of Directive 2006/112, it should be recalled that the Court has already assessed that article in the context of cases relating to Article 70 of the ZDDS (judgments of 16 February 2012, Eon Aset Menidjmunt, Câ€‘118/11, EU:C:2012:97, paragraphs 71 to 74, and of 18 July 2013, AES-3C Maritza East 1, Câ€‘124/12, EU:C:2013:488, paragraphs 45 to 54). It is important to point out that, even if Article 70 of the ZDDS were to provide for an exception from the right to deduct in place at the date of accession of the Republic of Bulgaria to the European Union, Article 176 of Directive 2006/112 allows for such exclusions to be maintained only in so far as they do not provide for general exclusions from the right to a deduct established by that directive and in particular by Article 168 thereof (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 April 2009, PARAT Automotive Cabrio, Câ€‘74/08, EU:C:2009:261, paragraph 29 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_17574__content">
            <p>As regards Article 26 of Directive 2006/112, that provision relates to the taxability of certain transactions. In the case in the main proceedings, the dispute does not concern the possible taxability of the supply of services carried out by the taxable person for the third party and the corresponding requirement to pay the VAT which would relate thereto, but rather concerns the right to deduct input VAT levied on the expenses incurred by the taxable person in order to carry out that supply of services.</p>

          <content eId="para_17575__content">
            <p>It is therefore unnecessary to examine the present dispute from the perspective of Article 26 of Directive 2006/112.</p>

            <p>Consequently, it is necessary to find that, by its questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 168(a) of Directive 2006/112 must be interpreted as meaning that a taxable person has the right to deduct input VAT in respect of a supply of services consisting of the construction or improvement of a property owned by a third party when that third party enjoys the results of those services free of charge and when those services are used both by the taxable person and by the third party in the context of their economic activity.</p>

            <p>With regard to whether the right to deduct laid down by Article 168(a) of Directive 2006/112 precludes a provision such as Article 70 of the ZDDS, it should be recalled that that right is an integral part of the VAT scheme and in principle may not be limited. It is exercisable immediately in respect of all the taxes charged on input transactions (see to that effect, in particular, judgments of 29 October 2009, SKF, Câ€‘29/08, EU:C:2009:665, paragraph 55, and of 18 July 2013, AES-3C Maritza East 1, Câ€‘124/12, EU:C:2013:488, paragraph 25).</p>

            <p>The deduction system is intended to relieve the trader entirely of the burden of the VAT payable or paid in the course of all his economic activities. The common system of VAT consequently ensures neutrality of taxation of all economic activities, whatever their purpose or results, provided that they are themselves subject in principle to VAT (see, in particular, judgments of 29 October 2009, SKF, Câ€‘29/08, EU:C:2009:665, paragraph 56, and of 18 July 2013, AES-3C Maritza East 1, Câ€‘124/12, EU:C:2013:488, paragraph 26).</p>

            <p>It follows from Article 168 of Directive 2006/112 that, in so far as the taxable person, acting as such at the time when he acquires goods or receives services, uses those goods or services for the purposes of his taxed transactions, he is entitled to deduct the VAT paid or payable in respect of those goods or services (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 October 2015, Sveda, Câ€‘126/14, EU:C:2015:712, paragraph 18).</p>

            <p>In accordance with settled case-law, the existence of a direct and immediate link between a particular input transaction and a particular output transaction or transactions giving rise to the right to deduct is necessary, in principle, before the taxable person is entitled to deduct input VAT and in order to determine the extent of such entitlement. The right to deduct VAT charged on the acquisition of input goods or services presupposes that the expenditure incurred in acquiring them was a component of the cost of the output transactions that gave rise to the right to deduct (judgments of 29 October 2009, SKF, Câ€‘29/08, EU:C:2009:665, paragraph 57, and of 18 July 2013, AES-3C Maritza East 1, Câ€‘124/12, EU:C:2013:488, paragraph 27).</p>

Such costs do have a direct and immediate link with the taxable person's economic activity as a whole (see, in particular, judgments of 29 October 2009, SKF, Câ€‘29/08, EU:C:2009:665, paragraph 58, and of 18 July 2013, AES-3C Maritza East 1, Câ€‘124/12, EU:C:2013:488, paragraph 28).</p>

            <p>It is apparent from the case-law of the Court that, in the context of the direct-link test that is to be applied by the tax authorities and national courts, they should consider all the circumstances surrounding the transactions concerned and take account only of the transactions which are objectively linked to the taxable person's taxable activity. The existence of such a link must thus be assessed in the light of the objective content of the transaction in question (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 October 2015, Sveda, Câ€‘126/14, EU:C:2015:712, paragraph 29).</p>

            <p>In the appraisal of the question as to whether, in circumstances such as those at issue in the main proceedings, Iberdrola has the right to deduct input VAT for the reconstruction of the waste-water pump station, it is therefore necessary to determine whether there is a direct and immediate link between, on the one hand, that reconstruction service and, on the other hand, a taxed output transaction by Iberdrola or that undertaking's economic activity.</p>
