            <p>The appellants are housing corporations ( woningcorporaties, `wocos') established in the Netherlands. Wocos are not-for-profit bodies whose mission is to acquire, build and rent out dwellings aimed mainly at underprivileged individuals and socially disadvantaged groups. Wocos also engage in other activities, such as the construction and lease of flats at higher rents, the construction of flats for sale and the construction and lease of public purpose buildings.</p>

            <p>In 2002, the Netherlands authorities notified the Commission of the European Communities of the general scheme of State aid provided for wocos.

            <p>On 14 July 2005, the Commission sent a letter to the Netherlands authorities under Article 17 of Regulation No 659/1999, classifying the general scheme of State aid provided for wocos as existing aid (aid measure E 2/2005) and expressing doubts as to the compatibility of that aid with the common market ( `the Article 17 letter'). First, the Commission indicated that the Netherlands authorities had to amend the public service mission entrusted to wocos, in such a way that social housing would be earmarked for a clearly defined target group of underprivileged individuals or socially disadvantaged groups. It stated that all commercial activities of wocos had to be carried out in accordance with market conditions and should not benefit from State aid. Finally, it stated that the offer of social housing had to be adapted to the requirements of underprivileged individuals or socially disadvantaged groups.</p>

            <p>After the Article 17 letter had been sent, the Commission and the Netherlands authorities commenced the cooperation procedure in order to bring the aid scheme into line with Article 106(2) TFEU. Following those consultations, pursuant to Article 18 of Regulation No 659/1999, the Commission proposed the following as appropriate measures to ensure that the measures in question complied with the provisions of EU law governing State aid:</p>

[was] compatible with Article 106(2) TFEU'.

            <p>By letter lodged at the Court Registry on 21 January 2016, Stichting Havensteder informed the Court that it was withdrawing its appeal. By order of 21 March 2016, Stichting Woonlinie and Others v Commission ( C‑415/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:231), the President of the Court removed Stichting Havensteder from Case C‑415/15 P and declared that it and the Commission would bear their own costs corresponding to the appeal lodged by that party.</p>

            <p>In the first ground of appeal, directed against paragraphs 56 to 60, 69 to 74, 81, 82, 86 and 87 of the order under appeal, the appellants submit that the General Court wrongly considered that the pleas in law that they had raised before it actually challenged the content of the Article 17 letter. In addition, the General Court, in paragraph 59 of the order under appeal, wrongly inferred from its judgment of 11 March 2009, TF1 v Commission ( T‑354/05, EU:T:2009:66), that its review was confined to checking the Commission's assessment of whether the commitments given were capable of resolving the competition problems found and that it did not extend to the underlying question of the need for the commitments. According to the appellants, it follows from the wording of Article 108(1) TFEU that the Commission's final decision must contain a determination on that question. That decision covers all of the procedure laid down in Articles 17 to 19 of Regulation No 659/1999. The review by the EU judicature should, consequently, also cover the question whether the earlier situation was compatible with the internal market.</p>

            <p>The Commission contends that a decision under Article 19(1) of Regulation No 659/1999 is not based on the final determination that an existing aid scheme is incompatible with the internal market. Such a decision is the expression of the cooperation referred to in Article 108(1) TFEU and its basic principle is not a unilateral, binding determination by the Commission, but rather the recognition by the latter and the Member State concerned of the need to adapt the existing aid scheme. The Commission is therefore not required to explain in its decision why it considers that such a scheme is not or is no longer compatible with the internal market. Furthermore, in the present case, the exchanges that took place between the Commission and the Netherlands authorities following the Article 17 letter did not concern whether the existing aid scheme was compatible with the internal market, but rather the manner in which that scheme should be adapted.</p>

In addition, Article 108(2) TFEU provides that if, after giving notice to the parties concerned to submit their comments, the Commission finds that aid is not compatible with the internal market having regard to Article 107 TFEU, or that such aid is being misused, it is to decide that the State concerned must abolish or alter such aid within a period of time to be determined by the Commission.</p>

            <p>Consequently, the General Court rejected as manifestly unfounded, in paragraph 66 of the order under appeal, the appellants' argument, put forward in the context of the second plea in law, that the Commission had acted ultra vires in requiring appropriate measures and rendering them binding in the decision at issue, holding that the appellants wrongly alleged that the Commission had required those appropriate measures and had rendered them binding in that decision and, in paragraphs 78 to 80 of that order, the arguments developed in the context of the fourth and sixth pleas in law, by which the appellants alleged that the Commission had erred in law and abused its powers by requiring the Netherlands authorities to provide a new definition of `social housing' and had incorrectly interpreted Commission Decision 2005/842/EC of 28 November 2005 on the application of Article 86(2) of the EC Treaty to State aid in the form of public service compensation granted to certain undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest ( OJ 2005 L 312, p. 67) by requiring a specific definition of a SGEI.</p>

            <p>It must be noted, in that respect, that the Court has held that, in the context of the procedure under Article 19(1) of Regulation No 659/1999, it is the Commission's decision recording the proposals of the Member State which renders those proposals binding (judgment of 27 February 2014, Stichting Woonpunt and Others v Commission, C‑132/12 P, EU:C:2014:100, paragraph 72).</p>

            <p>It follows from the case-law mentioned in paragraph 60 of the present judgment and cited in paragraph 65 of the order under appeal that the appropriate measures that the Commission proposes under Article 108(1) TFEU, in so far as they are accepted by a Member State, are binding on that Member State, as provided in the second sentence of Article 19(1) of Regulation No 659/1999. However, that acceptance produces legal effects only if it is notified to the Commission and the latter records it and informs the Member State thereof, in accordance with the first sentence of Article 19(1) of that regulation.</p>

            <p>It was therefore incumbent on the General Court to examine the substance of the appellants' arguments mentioned in paragraph 61 of the present judgment, regardless, moreover, of the issue of the respective roles of the Commission and the Member States in the adoption of appropriate measures.</p>

            <p>As regards paragraphs 90 to 95 of the order under appeal, it must be noted that, contrary to the appellants' assertions, the General Court did not reject, in those paragraphs, the appellants' arguments concerning the appropriate measures required by the Commission, but rather examined the arguments put forward in support of the appellants' eighth plea in law. By that plea in law, the appellants alleged that the Commission had abused the procedure in relation to existing aid schemes and exceeded its powers by approving an exhaustive list of buildings that could be classified as `social property', even though it had not made recommendations as regards the preparation of such a list in either the Article 17 letter or in the proposals for appropriate measures.</p>
