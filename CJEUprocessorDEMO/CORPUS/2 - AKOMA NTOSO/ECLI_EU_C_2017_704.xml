The Commission shall be assisted by a committee composed of representatives of the Member States. The committee shall be chaired by a representative of the Commission.

The committee shall deliver its opinion on the draft implementing act within a time limit which the chair may lay down according to the urgency of the matter. Time limits shall be proportionate and shall afford committee members early and effective opportunities to examine the draft implementing act and express their views. 4.   Until the committee delivers an opinion, any committee member may suggest amendments and the chair may present amended versions of the draft implementing act. The chair shall endeavour to find solutions which command the widest possible support within the committee. The chair shall inform the committee of the manner in which the discussions and suggestions for amendments have been taken into account, in particular as regards those suggestions which have been largely supported within the committee. ... 7.   Where applicable, the control mechanism shall include referral to an appeal committee. The appeal committee shall adopt its own rules of procedure by a simple majority of its component members, on a proposal from the Commission. Where the appeal committee is seised, it shall meet at the earliest 14 days, except in duly justified cases, and at the latest 6 weeks, after the date of referral. Without prejudice to paragraph 3, the appeal committee shall deliver its opinion within 2 months of the date of referral. A representative of the Commission shall chair the appeal committee. The chair shall set the date of the appeal committee meeting in close cooperation with the members of the committee, in order to enable Member States and the Commission to ensure an appropriate level of representation.

            <p>In that connection, Tilly-Sabco observes that it is common ground that the contested regulation was not renewed and concludes that that regulation cannot be treated as a periodic agricultural instrument. It recalls that the Commission's practice was to adopt regulations on refunds every three months, but that it decided not to convene a meeting of the Management Committee in October 2013 to re-evaluate the refund rate. If it was a periodic agricultural instrument, the Commission would have been obliged to undertake that re-evaluation.</p>

            <p>By the third part of the third ground of appeal, Tilly-Sabco asserts that paragraphs 253 to 259 of the judgment under appeal are vitiated by contradictory reasoning, in that they indicate that setting the refund rates at zero was part of a progressive reduction of the amounts of those refunds, and that the last reduction was not structurally different from the previous ones. Tilly-Sabco argues that that progressive reduction was a political decision and not an application of the criteria laid down in Article 164(3) of Regulation No 1234/2007, as the Commission acknowledged in its defence at first instance by referring to an international undertaking made in that regard.</p>

Tilly-Sabco observes that the General Court held, in paragraph 289 of the judgment under appeal, that the difference in price with chickens from Brazil was estimated at EUR 44.73 per 100 kilos. It observed that that difference is significant and requires the grant of export refunds. Furthermore, the General Court took only the international market into consideration and failed also to take into consideration the domestic market as required by that provision.</p>

            <p>In any event, the General Court rightly observed, in paragraphs 123 and 124 of the judgment under appeal, that the rules for the consultation of a committee are intended to ensure that the prerogatives of its members are respected, not to protect the rights of economic operators.

            <p>The Commission adds that, in paragraphs 125 to 129 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court held for the sake of completeness that, as required by the case-law of the Court, Tilly-Sabco failed to establish that in the absence of the alleged infringement the outcome of the procedure would have been different. The appeal does not contain any elements capable of invalidating that finding, even though there is no legal or practical impediments preventing the production of such evidence in the present case. It must be held that the outcome of the deliberation of the Management Committee would have been similar if it had had a period of 10 extra days to examine the draft of the contested regulation, since all the data would have resulted in the refunds being fixed at zero.</p>

            <p>In paragraphs 83 to 120 of the judgment under appeal the General Court held that the practice of the Commission challenged, which is described in paragraphs 76 to 78 thereof and consists essentially in submitting drafts of regulations classified as `standard' (which differ from those they replace solely by an alteration to the figures they adopt) only in the course of Management Committee meetings, to be consistent with the requirements laid down by Article 3(3) of Regulation No 182/2011.</p>

            <p>In that connection, it must be observed, first, that, although the comitology decisions provided that a draft of measures to be taken had to be submitted to the committee, Article 3(3) of Regulation No 182/2011 requires the draft of an implementing act to be adopted must be submitted to that committee.</p>

            <p>Second, while the comitology decisions did not lay down time limits between the submission of draft measures, sending the draft agenda and holding the relevant meeting of the Management Committee, Regulation No 182/2011 fixes a time limit of at least 14 days, except in duly justified cases, between the submission of the draft implementing act and the draft agenda to the Management Committee and convening a meeting of the committee.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, it must be held that the first time limit is to enable an unhurried examination of a draft implementing act before a meeting, by the Management Committee members, and that the second must enable them to express their views on the draft. That finding is supported by Article 3(4) of Regulation No 182/2011 which states that, `until the committee delivers an opinion, any committee member may suggest amendments'.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, since Article 291(3) TFEU expressly provides for control by Member States of the Commission's exercise of implementing powers conferred on it by paragraph 2 of that article, it must be held that the first time limit also aims to guarantee that the governments of the Member States are informed through their Management Committee members about the Commission's proposals, so that those governments may, by means of internal and external consultations, define a position in order to protect the specific interests of each of them within the Management Committee.</p>

            <p>Finally, that practice, which makes it impossible for the Management Committee members to express their views or suggest amendments before the relevant meeting, is contrary to Article 3(4), first subparagraph, of that regulation, according to which those members must be in a position to do so at any time before the adoption of that act.</p>

            <p>As to the justification for the non-compliance with the first time limit of 14 days relied on by the Commission, that there is a risk of leaks, it must be observed that to accept that justification would amount to systematically dispensing the Commission from compliance with the first time limit, since there is always a risk of leaks as the Commission itself affirms. Similarly, to consider, as did the General Court in paragraphs 113 to 115 of the judgment under appeal, that an urgent situation suddenly arises each time an implementing regulation is to be adopted, would amount to making the exception provided for routine.</p>

            <p>Moreover, no other conclusion can be drawn from the reference, in recital 5 of Regulation No 182/2011, to the objective of efficient procedures and the experience acquired and the common practice followed in the implementation of Decision 1999/468 specifically as regards the adoption of standard implementing regulations which differ from those which they replace solely by a change to the figures which are updated and adopted after each meeting of the Management Committee.</p>

            <p>In that connection, it must be recalled that Article 3(3) of Regulation No 182/2011 does not continue a common practice but substantially alters it, inter alia, by introducing the first time limit of 14 days, distinguishing the purpose of that time limit from that of the time limit preceding the delivery of the Management Committee's opinion, and prohibiting those time limits being shortened disproportionately or in a manner which deprives them of their purpose.</p>
