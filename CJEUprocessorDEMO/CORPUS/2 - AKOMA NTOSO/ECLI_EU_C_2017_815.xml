            <p>On 15 May 2015, I, a French resident, was stopped in the municipality of Kehl (Germany) whilst driving a category B vehicle on public roads. I had with him a valid personal identity card and a certificat d'examen du permis de conduire(Driving licence test pass certificate, `CEPC'), a provisional document issued, in principle, to every applicant having passed the theory and practical tests for category B driving licences in France and which is, under French legislation, regarded as a driving licence in the national territory in dealings with the police for a period of four months from the date of the practical test. It is common ground that, at the date I was stopped, he had not yet been issued his definitive driving licence by the French authorities.</p>

            <p>According to the referring court, the award of a CEPC grants the right to drive a power-driven vehicle in the relevant category without that right being limited to French territory. Similarly to German law, French law distinguishes between the right to drive and the document evidencing such a right, namely a driving licence, even if in French the same term is used for both concepts ( ` permis de conduire'). Thus, driving a vehicle without holding a driving licence is punishable as a criminal offence with a custodial sentence, whereas driving a vehicle without being in possession of a driving licence is punishable as an administrative offence.</p>

            <p>The validity of a CEPC as a document evidencing the right to drive is limited under French law to four months. In principle, a definitive driving licence is issued to an applicant within that time. If the applicant does not, however, receive the definitive driving licence within that time, the CEPC is no longer valid as a document evidencing a right to drive, but that right itself does not expire. Thus, a person who has not applied in the correct form within four months for the issuing of a driving licence, and whose CEPC loses its validity as a document evidencing a right to drive after four months, drives, according to French law, not without the right to drive but without a driving licence. Such a person may therefore be charged with an administrative offence but not a criminal offence.</p>

            <p>After a CEPC has been issued, the issuing of a category B driving licence depends only on whether the applicant lodges an application in the correct form. Driving licences are therefore issued almost automatically. The applicant has no control over the duration of the procedure for issuing the driving licence.</p>

            <p>The referring court further submits that the question arises of whether Article 2 of Directive 2006/126 must be interpreted as requiring the Member States to recognise a right to drive only where a definitive driving licence has been issued as a document evidencing such a right, or whether the obligation of mutual recognition applies to the right to drive as such, irrespective of whether a definitive driving licence has been issued by the competent authority.</p>

            <p>It would be impossible for an applicant for a driving licence resident in France, immediately after passing the practical driving test, to take up a post in Germany which he could reach only by driving there in his own vehicle. By contrast, an applicant for a driving licence residing in Germany would not be faced with that restriction. Thus, although both could prove that they had fulfilled the requirements for obtaining a driving licence, as harmonised under Directive 2006/126, they would not enjoy the same rights. The referring court therefore takes the view that there appears to be discrimination based on residence in another Member State.</p>

            <p>Article 1(1) of Directive 2006/126 provides that the Member States are to introduce a national driving licence based on the EU model set out in Annex I to that directive, in accordance with the provisions of the directive. That model lays down the appearance of the driving licence and sets out the information which must be included. As regards the content of such a driving licence, Article 5(1) of Directive 2006/126 stipulates that driving licences are to state the conditions under which the driver is authorised to drive. So far as concerns the security features aimed at avoiding any risk of forgery, Article 3(2) of the directive, read in conjunction with Annex I thereto, expressly provides that the material used for the driving licence is to be made secure against forgery.</p>

Those conditions are, in particular, set out in Articles 4 and 7 of that directive and concern, inter alia, the requisite minimum age, fitness to drive, the tests which the applicant must pass and the residency of the applicant in the issuing Member State.</p>

            <p>The Court has held in that regard that once the authorities of one Member State have issued a driving licence in accordance with Article 1(1) of Directive 2006/126, the other Member States are not entitled to investigate whether the conditions for issue laid down by that directive have been met, since the possession of a driving licence issued by one Member State has to be regarded as constituting proof that its holder satisfied those conditions on the day on which that licence was issued (see, to that effect, judgments of 26 April 2012, Hofmann, C‑419/10, EU:C:2012:240, paragraphs 46 and 47, and of 23 April 2015, Aykul, C‑260/13, EU:C:2015:257, paragraph 47).</p>

            <p>In the light of that case-law, a literal interpretation of Article 2(1) of Directive 2006/126 and the general scheme of that directive, it therefore appears that that provision, which provides for the mutual recognition of `driving licences', refers to driving licences as documents evidencing the existence of a right to drive issued in accordance with the provisions of that directive. The only qualification in that regard concerns driving licences issued by the Member States before the entry into force of Article 1(1) of the directive, that is, under Article 16 thereof, before 19 January 2013, and for which Article 13 of Directive 2006/126 is designed to govern the question of equivalences between rights acquired before the implementation of that directive and the various categories of driving licence defined by the latter (see, to that effect, judgments of 26 April 2012, Hofmann, C‑419/10, EU:C:2012:240, paragraph 41, and of 26 April 2017, Popescu, C‑632/15, EU:C:2017:303, paragraph 37).</p>

In addition, it appears from recitals 3 and 4 of that directive that the directive expressly aims to solve and avoid problems of transparency for citizens, police forces and the administrations responsible for the administration of driving licences and the falsification of driving licences, resulting from the coexistence of different rules in different Member States and from over 110 different models of driving licences valid in the European Union. The directive thus aims, as stated in paragraph 39 above, ultimately to introduce a single-model driving licence for all Member States, the minimal conditions for the issuing of which are harmonised by that directive and which is set to replace the various driving licences in existence in the Member States, thereby gradually putting an end to the recognition of national driving ability tests.</p>

As the Advocate General stated in point 56 of his Opinion, it would clearly go against the aim of Directive 2006/126, which is to introduce a single standardised driving licence allowing for immediate and easy recognition by any authority anywhere in the European Union, if that directive were interpreted as obliging one Member State to recognise various -- potentially provisional -- documents that may be issued by another Member State for the purpose of proving the existence of a right to drive.</p>

            <p>According to the referring court, the existence of differences in the administrative procedures of the Member States governing the issuing of driving licences conforming to such requirements could mean, as in the case in the main proceedings, that a person who satisfies the conditions set out in Directive 2006/126 for obtaining the right to drive in his Member State of residence is granted a driving licence conforming to those requirements only after the transition period has come to an end during which that person holds only a certificate subject to temporal and territorial limitations, whereas persons residing in other Member States also fulfilling those conditions are granted such a driving licence immediately after having passed the practical driving test.</p>

            <p>In that regard, and contrary to what the referring court seems to consider, even in circumstances in which there are differences between the Member States in the procedure for issuing driving licences, the refusal by a Member State to recognise a document issued by another Member State intended to prove a right to drive, such as the CEPC at issue in the main proceedings, where that document does not fulfil the requirements of the model driving licence provided for in Directive 2006/126, is not such as to run counter to the general prohibition of discrimination laid down in Article 18 TFEU, the right to move and reside freely in the territory of the Member States conferred on citizens of the Union by Article 21 TFEU, or the fundamental freedoms enshrined in Articles 45, 49 and 56 TFEU.</p>

            <p>The difference in treatment of applicants for a driving licence residing in Germany and France, which follows from the fact that, according to the information provided by the referring court, applicants for a driving licence residing in Germany generally receive a driving licence in that Member State immediately after having passed the practical driving test, whereas, as a general rule, a transitional period applies to applicants for a driving licence residing in France, during which they have only a certificate subject to temporal and territorial limitations evidencing their right to drive, before being issued with a driving licence in conformity with the requirements of the model driving licence of Directive 2006/126, is not the result of discriminatory practices in either of the two Member States, but that of the existence of different rules of administrative procedure in those Member States in a non-harmonised context (see, by analogy, judgments of 12 July 2005, Schempp, C‑403/03, EU:C:2005:446, paragraph 45, and of 29 November 2011, National Grid Indus, C‑371/10, EU:C:2011:785, paragraph 62). As stated in paragraphs 43, 44 and 57 above, as EU law currently stands, Directive 2006/126 provides only for minimum harmonisation of certain substantive conditions under which the driving licence provided for in Article 1 of that directive is issued.</p>

            <p>64 By its third and fourth questions, which it is appropriate to consider together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 2(1) of Directive 2006/126 and Articles 18, 21, 45, 49 and 56 TFEU must be interpreted as precluding a Member State from imposing a criminal penalty or an administrative fine on a person who, despite having satisfied the conditions for the issuing of a driving licence as provided for in that directive, drives a motor vehicle in that Member State without a driving licence conforming to the model driving licence provided for in that directive and who, pending the issuing of such a driving licence by another Member State, can prove only that he has been authorised to drive in another Member State by means of a temporary certificate issued by that Member State.</p>

            <p>As the Advocate General stated in point 64 of his Opinion, Directive 2006/126 does not contain any provision regarding potential penalties for persons driving without the right to do so or who fail to present a driving licence conforming to the requirements of the model driving licence provided for in the directive or another type of document attesting that right.</p>

            <p>It follows that, in the absence of EU rules governing the matter, the Member States, in principle, remain competent to impose penalties for breach of the obligation to present a driving licence in conformity with the requirements of the model driving licence of Directive 2006/126, which they are free to impose on persons driving a motor vehicle in their territory (see, to that effect, judgments of 29 February 1996, Skanavi and Chryssanthakopoulos, C‑193/94, EU:C:1996:70, paragraph 36, and of 29 October 1998, Awoyemi, C‑230/97, EU:C:1998:521, paragraph 25).</p>

            <p>As regards Article 18 TFEU, also mentioned by the referring court, it must be borne in mind that that provision, which lays down the principle of the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of nationality, applies independently only to situations governed by EU law in respect of which the TFEU lays down no specific prohibitions of discrimination (see, to that effect, judgments of 12 May 1998, Gilly, C‑336/96, EU:C:1998:221, paragraph 37, and of 18 July 2017, Erzberger, C‑566/15, EU:C:2017:562, paragraph 25).</p>

            <p>In the present case, since the order for reference does not state why I was in Germany, it is for the referring court to ascertain whether the exercise of one of the fundamental freedoms under Articles 45, 49 and 56 TFEU implementing the principle of non-discrimination could be affected by imposing a penalty on I.</p>

            <p>If that is not the case, in so far as I appears to be a citizen of the Union, which it is also for the referring court to ascertain, it would seem, in any event, that, by travelling from France to Germany, that person made use, in his capacity as a Union citizen, of his right to move freely within the European Union under Article 21 TFEU.</p>

            <p>Nonetheless, according to the order for reference and the answer to the first and second questions, in the present case, unlike the persons prosecuted in the case having given rise to the judgment of 29 February 1996, Skanavi and Chryssanthakopoulos ( C‑193/94, EU:C:1996:70), I, despite being authorised to drive in France, did not, at the time of the facts at issue in the main proceedings, at least under EU law, have such authorisation in other Member States which the authorities of those Member States would have been required to recognise in accordance with Article 2(1) of Directive 2006/126, since I did not, at that time, have a driving licence conforming to the requirements of the model driving licence provided for in that directive proving that he fulfilled the requirements laid down in the directive. In addition, it is clear from the order for reference that the CEPC issued to him in France is valid only in French territory.</p>

            <p>The fact remains that driving a vehicle in the territory of a Member State while holding a right to drive granted in another Member State but not yet being in possession of a driving licence conforming to the requirements of the model driving licence of Directive 2006/126 appears much less objectionable than driving in a Member State without any right to drive, in particular having regard to the objective of that directive, as recalled in paragraph 51 above, which is to contribute to improving road safety.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Second Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 2(1) of Directive 2006/126/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 20 December 2006 on driving licences and Articles 18, 21, 45, 49 and 56 TFEU must be interpreted as not precluding legislation of a Member State under which that Member State may refuse to recognise a certificate issued in another Member State evidencing its holder's right to drive, where that certificate does not fulfil the requirements of the model driving licence provided for in that directive, even if the conditions set by that directive for issuing a driving licence have been satisfied by the holder of that certificate. 2. Article 2(1) of Directive 2006/126 and Articles 21, 45, 49 and 56 TFEU must be interpreted as not precluding a Member State from imposing a penalty on a person who, despite having satisfied the conditions for the issuing of a driving licence as provided for in that directive, drives a motor vehicle in that Member State without a driving licence conforming to the model driving licence provided for in that directive and who, pending the issuing of such a driving licence by another Member State, can prove only that he has been granted the right to drive in another Member State by means of a temporary certificate issued by that Member State, provided that that penalty is not disproportionate to the seriousness of the facts at issue. It is thus for the referring court to take into account, in its assessment of the seriousness of the offence committed by the person in question and of the severity of the penalty to be imposed on him, as a potentially mitigating circumstance, the fact that that person had been granted the right to drive in another Member State, evidenced by a certificate issued by that other Member State which will, in principle, be exchanged before its expiry, at that person's request, for a driving licence conforming to the requirements of the model driving licence provided for in Directive 2006/126.
