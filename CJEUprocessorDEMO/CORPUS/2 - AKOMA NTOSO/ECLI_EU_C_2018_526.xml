            <p>Article 7(1) of the Convention between the Nordic countries for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on income and capital, concluded in Helsinki on 23 September 1996 (BKI No 92 of 25.6.1997; `the Nordic Convention') provides: `The profits of an undertaking of a Contracting State shall be taxable only in that State unless the undertaking carries on business in the other Contracting State through a permanent establishment situated therein. If the undertaking carries on business as aforesaid, the profits of the undertaking may be taxed in the other State but only so much of them as is attributable to that permanent establishment.'</p>

            <p>Under Paragraph 31(1) of the Selskabsskattelov (Law on corporation tax), Danish companies belonging to a group are subject to compulsory national group taxation. The group tax is paid by the ultimate parent company (or group parent company) if it is subject to tax in Denmark or, otherwise, by a resident company belonging to the group, known as an `administration company'.</p>

            <p>National group taxation is based on the principle of territoriality of taxation in Denmark. Pursuant to that principle, the profits of the group's subsidiaries and permanent establishments established outside Denmark are not included in the group's profits taxed in Denmark, unless the group has opted for international group taxation, pursuant to Paragraph 31 A of the Law on corporation tax. By contrast, the scope of the group taxation includes all of the companies and permanent establishments belonging to the group and established in Denmark.</p>

However, in that case, the setting-off of the losses sustained by the Danish branch of a company with its registered office in another Member State against the group's combined taxable profits is subject to special rules, laid down in Paragraph 31(2)(2) of the Law on corporation tax, under which: `A loss in a permanent establishment may be set off against the income of other companies only if the rules in the foreign State ... in which the company is resident provide that a loss can not be set off in the calculation of the company 's income in the foreign State ... or if group taxation has been chosen pursuant to Paragraph 31 A ...'</p>

            <p>In that regard, in the case giving rise to that judgment, the referring court was uncertain as to the compatibility with freedom of establishment of provisions of UK legislation making the possibility of transferring, by means of group relief and to a resident company, losses sustained by the permanent establishment in that Member State of a non-resident company subject to a condition comparable to that laid down in Paragraph 31(2)(2) of the Danish Law on corporation tax.</p>

            <p>The Danish Government points out that, quite to the contrary, Danish legislation sets down an equivalent condition for resident companies. Paragraph 5 G of the Law on assessment provides that companies may not deduct charges which, pursuant to the tax legislation of another State, are already deductible from taxable income in that State. That paragraph thus precludes the setting off, against the profits of a group taxed in Denmark, of the losses of the resident subsidiary of a non-resident company in the group, in the case where the setting-off of those losses is possible pursuant to the law of the Member State in which the non-resident company is established.</p>

            <p>NN explains that the losses of a permanent establishment, situated in Denmark, of a resident company in the group are deductible without restriction from the group's taxable profits in Denmark. In the case in the main proceedings, NN points out that, if the Danish permanent establishment had been owned by one of its Danish subsidiaries, its losses could, in any event, have been set off against the group's profits.</p>

            <p>The Court has held that, with regard to measures laid down by a Member State in order to prevent or mitigate the double taxation of a resident company's profits, companies which have a permanent establishment in another Member State are not, in principle, in a situation comparable to that of companies which have a resident permanent establishment (judgment of 12 June 2018, Bevola and Jens W.

            <p>It is nevertheless important to make an exception for the situation in which there is no other possibility of deducting the losses of the non-resident subsidiary attributable to the permanent establishment which is resident in the Member State in which the subsidiary is established. In that situation, the group whose subsidiary is situated in another Member State is not in a different situation to that of the purely national group, in the light of the objective of preventing the double deduction of its losses. The tax-paying capacity of the two groups is then affected in the same way by the losses of their resident permanent establishment (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 June 2018, Bevola and Jens W.

            <p>In that regard, it should be noted that the former ground does not constitute a relevant justification. If the loss attributable to the permanent establishment could be deducted both from the group's taxable profits in the Member State in which that establishment is situated, and from the profits, taxable in the other Member State, of the group's non-resident subsidiary, that possibility of double deduction would favour neither of the two Member States concerned to the detriment of the other. Thus, the balanced distribution of powers of taxation between them would not be affected. The absence of a rule such as that laid down in Paragraph 31(2)(2) of the Law on corporation tax would simply entail a loss of tax revenue for one of the two States.</p>
