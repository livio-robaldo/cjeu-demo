            <p>In that regard, it is clear from both the wording and the scheme of Article 267 TFEU that a national court or tribunal is not empowered to bring a matter before the Court by way of a reference for a preliminary ruling unless a case is pending before it, in which it is called upon to give a decision that is capable of taking account of the Court's ruling. Consequently, the Court is required to verify, of its own motion, the continued existence of the dispute in the main proceedings (see, to that effect, judgment of 13 September 2016, Rendón Marín, C‑165/14, EU:C:2016:675, paragraph 24 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>When asked by the Court to indicate whether it still needed a reply to the question referred in order to give judgment in the main proceedings, the referring court stated that it wished to maintain its request for a preliminary ruling. It specified, in essence, that the judgment of the Conseil du contentieux des étrangers (Council for asylum and immigration proceedings) of 11 March 2016 annulling the decision of the CGRA of 23 May 2014 did not, in itself, have any legal effect on the order to leave the national territory at issue in the main proceedings and that the grant of a temporary residence permit to Mr Gnandi did not implicitly entail the withdrawal of that order. It added that that order became legally effective once again on 30 June 2016, when Mr Gnandi's application for international protection was again rejected by the CGRA.</p>

Thus, having regard to the information provided by the referring court, it must be held that the dispute in the main proceedings is still pending before the referring court and that a reply from the Court to the question referred remains useful for resolving that dispute.

            <p>By its question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Directive 2008/115, read in conjunction with Directive 2005/85 and in the light of the principle of non-refoulement and the right to an effective remedy, enshrined in Article 18, Article 19(2) and Article 47 of the Charter, must be interpreted as precluding the adoption of a return decision under Article 6(1) of Directive 2008/115 in relation to a third-country national who has applied for international protection, immediately after the rejection of that application by the determining authority and thus before the conclusion of any appeal proceedings brought against that rejection.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, it should be noted, as the referring court observed in its request for a preliminary ruling, that the order to leave the national territory at issue in the main proceedings constitutes a return decision within the meaning of Article 3(4) of Directive 2008/115. That provision defines a `return decision' as an administrative or judicial decision or act, stating or declaring the stay of a third-country national to be illegal and imposing or stating an obligation to return.</p>

            <p>Thus, in order to determine whether a return decision may be adopted in relation to a third-country national after his or her application for international protection has been rejected by the determining authority, it is necessary to examine, in the first place, whether, following that rejection, the person concerned is to be regarded as staying illegally on the territory of that Member State, within the meaning of Directive 2008/115.</p>

          <content eId="para_14151__content">
            <p>In that regard, it follows from the definition of the concept of `illegal stay', set out in Article 3(2) of Directive 2008/115, that any third-country national who is present on the territory of a Member State without fulfilling the conditions for entry, stay or residence is, by virtue of that fact alone, staying there illegally (judgment of 7 June 2016, Affum, C‑47/15, EU:C:2016:408, paragraph 48).</p>

            <p>In accordance with Article 7(1) of Directive 2005/85, an applicant for international protection is to be allowed to remain in the Member State, for the sole purpose of the procedure, until adoption of a decision at first instance refusing that person's application. Even though, according to the express wording of that provision, that right to remain does not constitute an entitlement to a residence permit, it is nevertheless apparent, inter alia, from recital 9 of Directive 2008/115, that that right to remain prevents an applicant for international protection from being regarded as `staying illegally', within the meaning of that directive, during the period from submission of the application for international protection until adoption of a first-instance decision on that application.</p>

            <p>As is quite clear from the wording of Article 7(1) of Directive 2005/85, the right to remain laid down in that provision ends upon the adoption of a first-instance decision, by the determining authority, rejecting the application for international protection. In the absence of a right to stay or a residence permit granted on another legal basis (such as Article 6(4) of Directive 2008/115) which would enable the third-country national whose application has been rejected to fulfil the conditions for entry, stay or residence in the Member State concerned, the consequence of that rejection decision, once adopted, is that the applicant no longer fulfils those conditions and, accordingly, that person's stay becomes illegal.</p>

            <p>It is true that, under Article 39(3)(a) of Directive 2005/85, Member States may provide for rules allowing applicants for international protection to remain on their territory pending the outcome of an appeal against the decision rejecting the application for international protection. In the present instance, it is apparent that Article 39/70 of the Law of 15 December 1980 lays down such a rule since it grants applicants for international protection the right to remain on Belgian territory until expiry of the time limit for bringing such an appeal and pending examination of that appeal, that being a matter to be verified by the referring court.</p>

            <p>It is also true that the Court has held, in paragraphs 47 and 49 of the judgment of 30 May 2013, Arslan ( C‑534/11, EU:C:2013:343), that an authorisation to remain for the purposes of exercising a right of appeal against a decision rejecting an application for international protection precludes the application of Directive 2008/115 to the third-country national who submitted that application until the conclusion of the appeal proceedings brought against that rejection decision.</p>

          <content eId="para_14156__content">
            <p>However, it cannot be inferred from that judgment that such an authorisation to remain precludes the conclusion that, as soon as the application for international protection is rejected, and without prejudice to the existence of a right to stay or to a residence permit as discussed in paragraph 41 above, the stay of the person concerned becomes illegal, within the meaning of Directive 2008/115.</p>

          <content eId="para_14157__content">
            <p>First, having regard to the context and scope of the questions referred for a preliminary ruling in the case which gave rise to that judgment, it is necessary to clarify that the interpretation given in that same judgment had as its sole purpose to ensure that a return procedure may not be pursued so long as the third-country national whose application has been rejected is authorised to remain pending the outcome of his appeal and, in particular, that, during that period, that person may not be held in detention, pursuant to Article 15 of that directive, with a view to his or her removal.</p>

            <p>Secondly, neither Article 3(2) of Directive 2008/115 nor any other provision of that directive makes the illegality of the stay dependent on the outcome of an appeal against an administrative decision on the ending of a legal stay or on the absence of an authorisation to remain pending the outcome of such an appeal. On the contrary, whereas, as noted in paragraph 40 of the present judgment, it is clear from a combined reading of Article 7(1) of Directive 2005/85 and recital 9 of Directive 2008/115 that the right of an applicant for international protection to remain on the territory of the Member State concerned, during the period from submission of the application until adoption of a first instance decision on that application, acts to prevent the concerned person's stay from being regarded as `illegal', within the meaning of Directive 2008/115, during that period; on the contrary, no provision or recital of Directive 2005/85 or of Directive 2008/115 provides that an authorisation to remain on the territory until resolution of an appeal against the rejection acts, in itself, to prevent that stay from being regarded as `illegal'.</p>

          <content eId="para_14159__content">
            <p>Thirdly, Directive 2008/115 is not based on the notion that the illegality of the stay and, accordingly, the applicability of that directive, presupposes that there is no lawful possibility for the third-country national to remain on the territory of the Member State concerned, inter alia pending the outcome of the appeal against the decision on the ending of a legal stay. On the contrary, as is apparent from recital 12, that directive is applicable to third-country nationals whose stay is classified as illegal, but who are permitted to remain lawfully on the territory of the Member State concerned because they cannot yet be removed. In particular, Article 7 of that directive requires the setting of an appropriate period for voluntary departure of the person concerned, during which, despite his stay being classified as illegal, he is authorised to remain. Moreover, pursuant to Article 5 and Article 9(1) of that directive, Member States are required to respect the principle of non-refoulement in relation to illegally staying third-country nationals and to postpone their removal when it would violate that principle.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, it should be noted that the main objective of Directive 2008/115, as apparent from recitals 2 and 4 thereof, is the establishment of an effective removal and repatriation policy that fully respects the fundamental rights and dignity of the persons concerned (see, to that effect, judgments of 7 July 2014, Pham, C‑474/13, EU:C:2014:2096, paragraph 20, and of 15 February 2016, N., C‑601/15 PPU, EU:C:2016:84, paragraph 75 and the case-law cited).</p>

          <content eId="para_14161__content">
            <p>That objective finds specific expression in Article 6(6) of Directive 2008/115, which explicitly allows Member States to adopt a decision on the ending of a legal stay together with a return decision, in a single administrative act. The possibility of aggregating those two decisions in a single administrative act enables Member States to ensure the parallel treatment, or even the joint handling, of the administrative proceedings leading to such decisions and of the appeal proceedings brought against them. As observed by the Czech, German and Netherlands Governments, that possibility of joint handling also helps overcome practical difficulties relating to the notification of return decisions.</p>

          <content eId="para_14162__content">
            <p>Adopting an interpretation of Directive 2008/115 to the effect that a stay may not be regarded as illegal solely on account of the authorisation to remain pending the outcome of an appeal against the decision rejecting the application for international protection, would render redundant that possibility of joint handling and would thus be contrary to the objective of establishing an effective removal and repatriation policy. Under such an interpretation, a return decision could be adopted only after the conclusion of the appeal proceedings, which could significantly delay the initiation of the return procedure and make that procedure more complex.</p>

            <p>Fifthly, as regards the obligation to comply with the requirements arising from the right to an effective remedy and the principle of non-refoulement, highlighted by the referring court in its question, it should be pointed out that any interpretation of Directive 2008/115 or of Directive 2005/85, must, as is apparent from recital 24 of the former and recital 8 of the latter, be consistent with the fundamental rights and principles recognised, in particular, by the Charter (see, to that effect, judgment of 17 December 2015, Tall, C‑239/14, EU:C:2015:824, paragraph 50).</p>

            <p>As regards, more specifically, the remedies against decisions related to return, as set out in Article 13 of Directive 2008/115, and the remedies against decisions rejecting an application for international protection, as set out in Article 39 of Directive 2005/85, the characteristics of such remedies must be determined in a manner that is consistent with Article 47 of the Charter, which provides that everyone whose rights and freedoms guaranteed by EU law are violated has the right to an effective remedy before a tribunal in compliance with the conditions laid down in that article (see, to that effect, judgments of 18 December 2014, Abdida, C‑562/13, EU:C:2014:2453, paragraph 45, and of 17 December 2015, Tall, C‑239/14, EU:C:2015:824, paragraph 51).</p>

Moreover, Article 18 of the Charter, like Article 78(1) TFEU, guarantees due respect for the rules of the Geneva Convention (see, to that effect, judgment of 21 December 2011, N.S. and Others, C‑411/10 and C‑493/10, EU:C:2011:865, paragraph 75).</p>

            <p>It is true that the Court has previously ruled that the lack of suspensory effect of an appeal brought solely against a decision rejecting an application for international protection is, in principle, compatible with the principle of non-refoulement and Article 47 of the Charter, since the enforcement of such a decision cannot, as such, lead to removal of the third-country national concerned (see, to that effect, judgment of 17 December 2015, Tall, C‑239/14, EU:C:2015:824, paragraph 56).</p>

            <p>By contrast, an appeal brought against a return decision within the meaning of Article 6 of Directive 2008/115 must, in order to ensure, as regards the third-country national concerned, compliance with the requirements arising from the principle of non-refoulement and Article 47 of the Charter, enable automatic suspensory effect, since that decision may expose the person concerned to a real risk of being subjected to treatment contrary to Article 18 of the Charter, read in conjunction with Article 33 of the Geneva Convention, or contrary to Article 19(2) of the Charter (see, to that effect, judgments of 18 December 2014, Abdida, C‑562/13, EU:C:2014:2453, paragraphs 52 and 53, and of 17 December 2015, Tall, C‑239/14, EU:C:2015:824, paragraphs 57 and 58).

The only requirement is that there must be a remedy before a judicial body (see, to that effect, judgment of 28 July 2011, Samba Diouf, C‑69/10, EU:C:2011:524, paragraph 69).</p>

            <p>It follows that, in respect of a return decision and a possible removal decision, the protection inherent in the right to an effective remedy and in the principle of non-refoulement must be guaranteed by affording the applicant for international protection the right to an effective remedy enabling automatic suspensory effect, before at least one judicial body. Subject to strict compliance with that requirement, the sole fact that the stay of the person concerned is categorised as being illegal, within the meaning of Directive 2008/115, as soon as his application for international protection is rejected at first instance by the determining authority and that a return decision may, therefore, be adopted after that rejection decision or aggregated together in a single administrative act, does not infringe the principle of non-refoulement or the right to an effective remedy.</p>

            <p>Having regard to all of those considerations, it must be concluded that, unless he has been granted a right to stay or a residence permit as referred to in Article 6(4) of Directive 2008/115, a third-country national is staying illegally, within the meaning of Directive 2008/115, as soon as his application for international protection is rejected at first instance by the determining authority, irrespective of the existence of an authorisation to remain pending the outcome of an appeal against that rejection. Thus, a return decision may, in principle, be adopted against such a third-country national after that rejection decision or aggregated together in a single administrative act.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, it should be pointed out, in the second place, that Member States are required to ensure that all return decisions are consistent with the procedural safeguards set out in Chapter III of Directive 2008/115 and with other relevant provisions of EU and national law. Article 6(6) of that directive explicitly lays down that requirement in the case where a return decision is adopted at the same time as the decision at first instance, from the determining authority, rejecting the application for international protection. That requirement must also apply in a situation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, in which the return decision was adopted immediately after the decision rejecting the application for international protection, in a separate administrative act and by a different authority.</p>

            <p>In that context, it is for the Member States to ensure the full effectiveness of an appeal against a decision rejecting an application for international protection, in accordance with the principle of equality of arms, which means, inter alia, that all the effects of the return decision must be suspended during the period prescribed for bringing that appeal and, if such an appeal is brought, until resolution of the appeal.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it is not sufficient for the Member State concerned to refrain from enforcing the return decision. On the contrary, it is necessary that all the legal effects of that decision be suspended and, in particular, that the period granted for voluntary departure in accordance with Article 7 of Directive 2008/115 should not start to run as long as the person concerned is allowed to remain. In addition, during that period, that person may not be held in detention with a view to removal pursuant to Article 15 of that directive.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, pending the outcome of an appeal against the rejection of his application for international protection at first instance by the determining authority, the person concerned must, in principle, be entitled to benefit from the rights arising under Directive 2003/9. Article 3(1) of that directive makes its application conditional only on the existence of an authorisation to remain on the territory as an applicant and, therefore, does not exclude the directive's application in the case where the person concerned has such an authorisation and is staying illegally, within the meaning of Directive 2008/115. In that regard, it is apparent from Article 2(c) of Directive 2003/9 that the person concerned is to retain his status as an applicant for international protection, within the meaning of that directive, until a final decision is adopted in relation to his application (see, to that effect, judgment of 27 September 2012, Cimade and GISTI, C‑179/11, EU:C:2012:594, paragraph 53).</p>

Accordingly, where a return decision is adopted after a first instance decision from the determining authority rejecting an application for international protection or together in a single administrative act, Member States are required to ensure that the person concerned is informed in a transparent way of their compliance with the safeguards discussed in paragraphs 61 to 64 above.</p>
