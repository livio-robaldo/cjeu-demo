        <p>2 Article 8 of Council Regulation (EC) No 1225/2009 of 30 November 2009 on protection against dumped imports from countries not members of the European Community ( OJ 2009 L 343, p. 51) ( `the basic regulation'), entitled `Undertakings', states: `1.   Upon condition that a provisional affirmative determination of dumping and injury has been made, the Commission may accept satisfactory voluntary undertaking offers submitted by any exporter to revise its prices or to cease exports at dumped prices, if, after specific consultation of the Advisory Committee, it is satisfied that the injurious effect of the dumping is thereby eliminated. In such a case and as long as such undertakings are in force, provisional duties imposed by the Commission in accordance with Article 7(1) or definitive duties imposed by the Council in accordance with Article 9(4) as the case may be shall not apply to the relevant imports of the product concerned manufactured by the companies referred to in the Commission decision accepting undertakings, as subsequently amended. Price increases under such undertakings shall not be higher than necessary to eliminate the margin of dumping and they should be less than the margin of dumping if such increases would be adequate to remove the injury to the Community industry. ... 9.   In case of breach or withdrawal of undertakings by any party to the undertaking, or in case of withdrawal of acceptance of the undertaking by the Commission, the acceptance of the undertaking shall, after consultation, be withdrawn by Commission Decision or Commission Regulation, as appropriate, and the provisional duty which has been imposed by the Commission in accordance with Article 7 or the definitive duty which has been imposed by the Council in accordance with Article 9(4) shall automatically apply, provided that the exporter concerned has, except where he himself has withdrawn the undertaking, been given an opportunity to comment.'</p>

            <p>According to recital 340 of the regulation at issue, `interested parties have pointed out that ... price elasticity of demand can be very high. Whereas it is correct that an important increase in prices may lead to an important reduction of demand ... it is very unlikely that price increases caused by the measures will be important, for the following reasons. ... the economic effect of the undertaking that has been accepted by the Commission is that Chinese exporting producers will supply the product concerned at a minimum import price of less than 60 c/W, which is far below the price that has been observed during the IP, at a volume that corresponds roughly to their current market share. At this price level, demand is very unlikely to drop in a significant manner, as that price level ensures sufficient demand both under the current level of support provided by support schemes and under the current levels of grid parity. Furthermore, the price of electricity for final consumers is expected to increase, whereas the price of the product concerned is expected to decrease. Through an indexation formula, the undertaking ensures that further price decreases of the product concerned are taken into account for the minimum import price. ... '</p>

The third plea in law alleged that Article 3 of that regulation infringes Article 101(1) TFEU in so far as it grants certain Chinese producers an exemption from anti-dumping measures on the basis of an offer of an undertaking, accepted and confirmed by the regulation at issue, which amounts to a horizontal pricing agreement.</p>

            <p>The Council argues that the first ground of appeal is inadmissible due to the fact that, first, SolarWorld merely repeats the complaint relating to the severability of Article 3 of the regulation at issue which it raised before the General Court and, second, the assessment relating to the severability of that provision is an assessment of fact.</p>

            <p>It should be noted, in the first place, that, where an appellant challenges the interpretation or application of EU law by the General Court, the points of law examined at first instance may be raised again in the course of an appeal. Indeed, if an appellant could not thus base his appeal on pleas in law and arguments already relied on before the General Court, an appeal would be deprived of part of its purpose (judgment of 19 January 2017, Commission v Total and Elf Aquitaine, C‑351/15 P, EU:C:2017:27, paragraph 31 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In the present case, by its first ground of appeal, SolarWorld is not seeking a mere re-examination of the application submitted to the General Court, but seeks, specifically, to call into question the legal reasoning which led the General Court to hold that Article 3 of the regulation at issue was not severable from the remainder of the provisions of that regulation, as well as the conclusion that the General Court drew from that finding, namely that SolarWorld's action was inadmissible. For that purpose, SolarWorld has indicated, to the requisite legal standard, the passages of the order under appeal that it considers to be vitiated by an error of law and the legal arguments relied on in support of its claim, thus enabling the Court of Justice to carry out a review.</p>

            <p>In the second place, it should be pointed out that a possible error by the General Court in the assessment of the severability of a provision of an act of EU law is an error of law which is subject to review by the Court of Justice (for such a review, see, inter alia, judgment of 29 March 2012, Commission v Estonia, C‑505/09 P, EU:C:2012:179, paragraphs 110 to 122).</p>

            <p>SolarWorld takes the view that Article 3 of the regulation at issue is severable from the other provisions of that regulation and, in particular, from Article 1(2) thereof, and that, consequently, the annulment of that provision would not change the scope of that regulation. In that regard, the General Court's reasoning in paragraphs 55 and 59 of the order under appeal was based on a fundamental misunderstanding of the concepts of `anti-dumping measures' and `anti-dumping duties'.</p>

            <p>SolarWorld states that anti-dumping measures may take various forms (ad valorem duties, fixed Euro amounts or MIP). With regards, more specifically, to the MIP, Article 8 of the basic regulation allows the Council and the Commission to accept MIP undertakings from individual exporting producers if the prices offered eliminate the injurious effects of dumping. Those producers are then exempt from paying the ad valorem duty because they are subject to another form of measures, namely the MIP in the context of their undertaking. Accordingly, the objective of anti-dumping measures, regardless of their form, is characterised by their adequacy to remove the injury to EU producers of the same product, and, in that regard, should have a remedial effect.</p>

            <p>Consequently, according to SolarWorld, altering the form of the anti-dumping measures does not alter the scope of the regulation which imposed them since those measures cover all imports from exporting producers which were found to have benefited from injurious dumping.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, SolarWorld claims that, pursuant to Article 8(9) of the basic regulation, according to which, in the event of a breach or a withdrawal of acceptance of the MIP undertaking, it is the ad valorem duties which would apply, the Commission enjoys flexibility in order to modify the form of anti-dumping measures, without it being a question of modifying the scope of those measures. In the present case, Article 3(2)(b) of the regulation at issue refers specifically to Article 8(9) of the basic regulation and, since the adoption of the regulation at issue, the Commission has withdrawn the acceptance of the MIP undertaking in respect of several Chinese exporting producers, imposing ad valorem duties on them. Thus, there has never been a time, since the entry into force of the regulation at issue, when those exporting producers were not subject to anti-dumping measures.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, if the General Court had upheld the action at first instance and annulled Article 3 of the regulation at issue on the ground that the MIP does not remove the injury caused to the Union industry, nothing would have prevented the Council and the Commission from establishing a new MIP at a level capable of removing that injury in accordance with Article 8(1) of the basic regulation. In that regard, SolarWorld indicates that such a declaration of invalidity would not necessarily have brought about a change of the scope of the measures, which is at the very core of the General Court's reasoning in paragraph 55 of the order under appeal. The only legal consequence of such a declaration would have been that the Council and the Commission would either have had to accept new undertakings containing a new MIP, eliminating the injurious effects of the dumping, or decide to apply ad valorem duties to all the Chinese exporting producers.</p>

            <p>Moreover, SolarWorld submits that the case-law relied on by the General Court, in paragraph 57 of the order under appeal, does not support the finding that Article 3 of the regulation at issue is not severable.</p>

            <p>Lastly, as regards the latter part of paragraph 55 of the order under appeal, according to which `imports consigned by Chinese exporting producers that had not consented to the undertaking accepted by the Commission [correspond] to 30% of the total imports of the product at issue', SolarWorld notes that Article 8(1) of the basic regulation requires that the MIP be established at a level adequate to remove injury, irrespective of the percentage of imports subject to anti-dumping measures in the form of a MIP. In addition, according to SolarWorld, the large number of Chinese exporting producers subject to the MIP does not alter the fact that the regulation at issue imposes anti-dumping measures and that the form of those measures is an issue which relates to neither the scope nor the subject matter of those measures.</p>

            <p>The Council, supported by the Commission, submits that SolarWorld's first ground of appeal must be rejected as unfounded. They take the view that the partial annulment of the regulation at issue is excluded because the result of such an annulment would be to substitute that regulation for an act with a different content, which does not correspond to the intentions of the author of that regulation and which, consequently, would affect its substance. -- Findings of the Court</p>

            <p>By its first ground of appeal, SolarWorld contests, in essence, the General Court's assessment, in paragraphs 55 and 59 of the order under appeal, by which it found that the annulment of Article 3 of the regulation at issue would affect the substance of that regulation and that, consequently, that provision is not severable from the remainder of the provisions of that regulation.</p>

            <p>It is clear from the settled case-law of the Court of Justice that the partial annulment of an EU act is possible only if the elements whose annulment is sought may be severed from the remainder of the act. In that regard, the Court of Justice has repeatedly held that the requirement of severability is not satisfied in the case where the partial annulment of an act would have the effect of altering its substance (judgment of 12 November 2015, United Kingdom v Parliament and Council, C‑121/14, EU:C:2015:749, paragraph 20 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Under Article 3 of the regulation at issue, which applies to certain products the references to which are specified in terms of the CN and which are invoiced by companies from which the Commission has accepted undertakings, imports declared for release into free circulation are exempt from the anti-dumping duty imposed by Article 1 of that regulation subject to compliance with certain conditions, that exemption ceasing whenever it is established that one or more of those conditions are not fulfilled or when the Commission withdraws its acceptance of the undertaking. As was noted in paragraph 10 above, the MIP for the panels and photovoltaic modules at issue and for each of their key components (i.e. cells and wafers) applies only up to a certain level of annual imports.</p>

            <p>It is against that legislative background that the General Court held, in paragraph 55 of the order under appeal, that Article 3 of the regulation at issue `exempts, within a certain quantitative limit, certain named economic operators from anti-dumping duties, subject to compliance with the conditions that it lays down. Consequently, by removing the applicable exemption of duties within that quantitative limit, the annulment of [that] measure would confer a greater scope on the anti-dumping duties than that which arises from the application of the [regulation at issue] as adopted by the Council for, in such a case, the anti-dumping duties would apply to all imports of the product at issue consigned from China whereas, under the [regulation at issue] taken as a whole, those duties would apply only to imports consigned by Chinese exporting producers that had not consented to the undertaking accepted by the Commission in Implementing Decision 2013/707, since those imports correspond, according to the parties, to 30% of the total imports of the product at issue. Such a result would alter the substance of the act in which the measure of which the annulment is sought is contained, namely the [regulation at issue]'.</p>

            <p>In paragraph 59 of the order under appeal, the General Court found that, in light of the alteration of the substance of the regulation at issue that would result from the annulment of Article 3 of that regulation, which would cancel the exemption from anti-dumping duties for imports from Chinese exporting producers which had consented to the undertaking accepted by the Commission, such a provision is not severable from the remainder of that regulation.</p>

            <p>First, it is apparent from the provisions of Article 1 and Article 3 of the regulation at issue, as was confirmed by all the parties to the present case, that the EU legislature, when adopting that regulation, put in place trade defence measures constituting a set or a `package'. That regulation imposes two separate and complementary measures which seek to achieve a common goal, namely the removal of the injurious effect on the Union industry of Chinese dumping relating to the products at issue, while safeguarding the interests of that industry.</p>

          <content eId="para_2908__content">
            <p>It is necessary, in that regard, to refer to recital 340 of the regulation at issue which, in the analysis of the impact of the imposition of trade defence measures on the interests of the Union industry, concerns the effects which, according to the Council, the undertaking relating to the MIP will have on the demand and supply of the products at issue. Two findings result from an examination of that recital. First, such an undertaking will have a positive economic effect on the European market for those products, to the extent that the MIP, by providing a lower price than that observed during the investigation period, would allow for the maintenance of a sufficient demand for the products at issue in the European Union. That measure thus appears to have had a significant and separate effect from that of the imposition of an ad valorem duty.</p>

          <content eId="para_2909__content">
            <p>Second, the undertaking relating to the MIP is evidently a measure which the Council took into account when assessing the impact of all the trade defence measures on the objective of the regulation at issue, which was to eliminate the injurious effect on the Union industry of Chinese dumping relating to the products at issue, while safeguarding the interests of that industry.</p>

          <content eId="para_2910__content">
            <p>It follows that the EU legislature considered the undertaking relating to the MIP, as well as the imposition of ad valorem duty, to be a key means of achieving the objective pursued by that regulation.</p>

          <content eId="para_2911__content">
            <p>Accordingly, the Court cannot accept SolarWorld's argument that the annulment of Article 3 of the regulation at issue -- even though it would have led, for the companies that consented to an undertaking relating to the MIP, to the removal of the benefit of that undertaking and to the imposition of ad valorem duty -- would not affect the substance of the regulation at issue, in so far as the imposition of an ad valorem duty itself achieves the same objective as that undertaking.</p>

          <content eId="para_2912__content">
            <p>Second, it should be recalled that the trade defence measures laid down by the regulation at issue contain objective differences as regards their nature. As was correctly pointed out by the Commission in its statement of intervention, when an ad valorem duty is imposed within the meaning of Article 1(1) of the regulation at issue, Chinese exporting producers are free to set their selling price to the European Union, a duty being subsequently imposed on that price once the product at issue is imported into the European Union. The revenue accruing from that duty is paid into the EU budget. By contrast, when a MIP is applied, those exporting producers may no longer freely set their price, that price having to be increased to the level of the MIP for imports of the product at issue declared for the free circulation. The additional revenue from that price increase accrues to the exporting producers in question.</p>

        <paragraph eId="para_2913">
          <num>50</num>
          <content eId="para_2913__content">
            <p>Accordingly, the regulation at issue is based on the possibility of applying those two separate measures alternatively, which allows Chinese exporting producers to rely on the MIP undertaking accepted by the Commission, within the meaning of Article 3 of the regulation at issue, and thus to avoid an ad valorem anti-dumping duty, such as that laid down by Article 1 of that regulation, from being imposed on their products. The annulment of Article 3 of that regulation would remove such a possibility and eliminate the alternative which the EU legislature wished to offer to Chinese exporting producers when adopting the regulation at issue. Taking account of the differences in the economic consequences of those two types of trade defence measures, such an annulment would therefore affect the very substance of the regulation at issue.</p>

        <paragraph eId="para_2914">
          <num>51</num>
          <content eId="para_2914__content">
            <p>It follows that SolarWorld's argument that, in the event of an annulment of Article 3 of that regulation, Chinese exporting producers would, at all times, be subject to an anti-dumping measure, does not in any way alter the finding that Chinese exporting producers are deprived of the choice which the EU legislature gave them when adopting that regulation.</p>

            <p>Third, as is clear from paragraph 55 of the order under appeal, 70% of imports of the products at issue from China are subject to the application of Article 3 of the regulation at issue.</p>

          <content eId="para_2916__content">
            <p>Consequently, it appears that the EU legislature implemented a set of measures under which the imposition of ad valorem duties appears formally to be the rule and the application of an undertaking relating to the MIP to be the exception to that rule, but, in fact, the application of the exception concerned the vast majority of cases with effect from the adoption of the regulation at issue. That undertaking therefore appears to be intended to apply primarily in the context of the imports from China concerned by the regulation at issue. Accordingly, the annulment of that undertaking would necessarily affect the substance of the regulation.</p>

            <p>Finally, as regards SolarWind's argument that the annulment by the General Court of Article 3 of the regulation at issue would not have prevented the EU legislature from setting a new MIP at a level adequate to remove injury to the Union industry, in accordance with Article 8(1) of the basic regulation, it must be noted that the analysis of the effect on the substance of an act of EU law depends solely on the consequences which result automatically from an annulment of the provision at issue of that act. Thus, the various measures which the author of that act may take following such an annulment cannot affect such an analysis.</p>

            <p>Since the very purpose of the basic regulation is to protect Union industries from injury caused by dumping, SolarWorld considers that, where the EU institutions find injurious dumping but fail to impose anti-dumping measures, in whatever form, at a level adequate to remove the injury suffered by the EU producers, the rights of the Union industry are violated. SolarWorld takes the view that, if the order under appeal was not found to be invalid, the photovoltaic industry in the present case would have no legal remedy when the Council and the Commission illegally impose anti-dumping measures in an amount which is inadequate to remove the injury suffered by EU producers.</p>

            <p>As regards the argument alleging infringement of Article 47 of the Charter, SolarWorld argues that if it were not in a position to challenge the regulation at issue in part, it would have no legal remedy where the EU institutions impose anti-dumping measures in an amount which is inadequate to remove the injury suffered by EU producers.</p>

            <p>In the first place, it should be recalled, in that regard, that that article is not intended to change the system of judicial review laid down by the Treaties, and particularly the rules relating to the admissibility of direct actions before the Courts of the European Union (judgments of 3 October 2013, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council, C‑583/11 P, EU:C:2013:625, paragraph 97, and of 24 November 2016, Ackermann Saatzucht and Others v Parliament and Council, C‑408/15 P and C‑409/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:893, paragraph 49).</p>

            <p>In the second place, the protection conferred by Article 47 of the Charter does not require an individual to be unconditionally entitled to bring an action for annulment of such an EU legislative act directly before the courts of the European Union (judgment of 3 October 2013, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council, C‑583/11 P, EU:C:2013:625, paragraph 105).</p>

            <p>In the third place, it is settled case-law that judicial review of compliance with the European Union legal order is ensured, as can be seen from Article 19(1) TEU, by the Court of Justice and by the courts and tribunals of the Member States. To that end, the FEU Treaty has established, by Articles 263 and 277 TFEU, on the one hand, and Article 267 TFEU, on the other, a complete system of legal remedies and procedures designed to ensure judicial review of the legality of European Union acts, and has entrusted such review to the European Union judicature (judgments of 3 October 2013, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami and Others v Parliament and Council, C‑583/11 P, EU:C:2013:625, paragraphs 90 and 92, and of 19 December 2013, Telefónica v Commission, C‑274/12 P, EU:C:2013:852, paragraph 57).</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the fact that SolarWind cannot bring an action only against a part of the regulation at issue which cannot be severed is not such as to infringe its rights under Article 47 of the Charter, in so far as that company could challenge the regulation at issue in its entirety. It could, subject to meeting the requirements as to standing laid down by Article 263(4) TFEU, challenge the regulation at issue directly before the General Court while requesting the suspension of the effects of that annulment until the adoption by the EU institutions of the necessary measures to implement the judgment bringing about the annulment, or challenge the validity of the regulation at issue before the national courts and get the latter to request a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice.</p>

            <p>It follows from the above considerations that the order under appeal, in so far as the General Court held therein that, since Article 3 of the regulation at issue is not severable from the remainder of that regulation, SolarWorld's application was inadmissible, does not infringe Article 47 of the Charter.</p>
