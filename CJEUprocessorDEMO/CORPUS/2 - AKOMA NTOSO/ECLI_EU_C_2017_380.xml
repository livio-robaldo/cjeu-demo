By decision of 13 June 2013, the examiner refused the application in relation to all the goods and services referred to in paragraph 3 above, in accordance with Article 7(1)(b) and (c) of Regulation No 207/2009, on the grounds that the mark applied for, first, lacked distinctive character and, second, informed consumers about the quality of the goods and services concerned. 6. On 3 July 2013, [Deluxe] filed a notice of appeal with [EUIPO], pursuant to Articles 58 to 64 of Regulation No 207/2009, against the examiner's decision. 7. By [the decision at issue], the Second Board of Appeal of [EUIPO] ( `the Board of Appeal') upheld the examiner's decision. It held, inter alia, that, in the parts of the European Union where English is understood, the word element `deluxe' is not on its own capable of distinguishing the applicant's goods and services from those of its competitors, for it is a form of commonplace promotional tag and merely consists of a ``claim of superior quality ''. It added that the term `deluxe' falls within the category of terms that must be excluded from trade mark monopoly and that the figurative element at issue was not sufficient to confer distinctive character on the mark applied for. On those same grounds, the Board of Appeal upheld the examiner's decision in so far as he had held that the mark applied for informs consumers about the quality of the goods and services concerned. The Board of Appeal also held that that mark had not acquired distinctive character through use in the European Union.'</p>

            <p>After having referred, in paragraphs 15 to 18 of the judgment under appeal, to the case-law of the Court of Justice, the General Court noted, in paragraphs 20 to 22 of that judgment, that, in the present case, having regard to the description of over 90 goods and services, included in eight different classes and relating to different fields, those goods and services display such differences given their nature, their characteristics, their intended use and the way in which they are marketed that they cannot be considered as a homogenous category making it possible for the Board of Appeal to adopt a general reasoning. The Board of Appeal did not indicate that the goods and services at issue had a sufficiently direct and specific link to each other so as to form a homogenous category ( `the required link').</p>

            <p>As the General Court noted in paragraph 23 of the judgment under appeal, the Board of Appeal refers, in general terms, to `the goods and services', `all the goods and services' and to `the goods and services at issue', but it does not refer specifically to any of the goods and services in the classes concerned, or to categories or groups thereof. Accordingly, the General Court held, in paragraph 24 of the judgment under appeal, that, by omitting to consider the distinctive character of the mark applied for, for each of the goods and services at issue, the Board of Appeal did not carry out the specific assessment required in Article 7(1)(b) of Regulation No 207/2009 in relation to the goods and services in the classes concerned and did not state reasons to the requisite legal standard in relation to the decision at issue in that respect.</p>

            <p>In the context of considering EUIPO's arguments, the General Court stated, in paragraph 26 of the judgment under appeal, that it does not follow, even indirectly, from the expression `without exception' that the Board of Appeal assessed the distinctive character of the mark applied for in the light of all the goods and services at issue. As the Court observed, the Board of Appeal merely indicated in the decision at issue that all the goods, without exception, can be presented as being of superior quality and that all the services, without exception, can be presented as providing such quality. It did not indicate that the goods and services in the classes concerned have the required link and, accordingly, did not mention any element of such a kind as to explain the recourse to a general reasoning.</p>

            <p>As for EUIPO's argument that the goods and services at issue were directly linked to the audiovisual sector, the General Court noted, in paragraph 27 of the judgment under appeal, that that finding does not appear in the decision at issue. Moreover, the General Court denied the existence of the required link between certain goods and services, such as motion pictures, delivery of goods by truck, warehouse storage and warehousing services, product research and development services as well as hosting and design of websites for others. It found that, in any event, the existence of such a link is not apparent from the wording of the decision at issue. Finally, the General Court considered that the fact, supposing it were established, that the word `deluxe' amounts to a laudatory and promotional term capable of applying to all the goods and services at issue has no bearing in that regard.</p>

            <p>By the first part of its single ground for appeal, EUIPO complains that the General Court erred in law by restricting the possibility of adopting a general reasoning only to the situation in which the goods and services form homogenous categories. EUIPO considers that the General Court cannot rule out the possibility of carrying out a general reasoning in relation to diverse goods and services where the perception of the sign in respect of each of them is uniform and, therefore, the reasoning which applies to them remains invariable.</p>

            <p>Thus, according to EUIPO, it is sufficient that the goods and services designated by the application for registration have a common characteristic for a general reasoning to be allowed in respect to them. That common characteristic is that, for each of the goods and services covered, the suggestion of high quality is perceived as a mere sales argument. In the present case, the sign `deluxe' conveys, in the same way for all those goods and services, a laudatory and promotional message incapable of allowing the public to identify the origin of those goods and services. In support of its line of argument, EUIPO relies on the reasoning adopted by the Court in the order of 11 December 2014, FTI Touristik v OHIM ( C‑253/14 P, not published, EU:C:2014:2445), in which the Court recognised that there was a sufficiently direct and specific link between the goods and services concerned in the light of a common feature which consisted of the fact that all the goods and services could be the subject of discounts or special benefits.</p>

            <p>Therefore, EUIPO considers that the finding in paragraph 24 of the judgment under appeal that the Board of Appeal did not carry out the concrete assessment required, having failed to identify homogeneity between all the goods and services, is erroneous.</p>

            <p>Similarly, EUIPO argues that the Court made an error in law by dismissing, in paragraph 27 of the judgment under appeal, as irrelevant, the Board of Appeal's finding that the term `deluxe' is a laudatory and promotional term capable of applying to all the goods and services at issue.</p>

            <p>Deluxe contends that EUIPO relied to a large extent on the BigXtra case which gave rise to the order of 11 December 2014, FTI Touristik v OHIM ( C‑253/14 P, not published, EU:C:2014:2445), in which the registration of the mark `BigXtra' had been refused on the ground that the term was clearly laudatory. Deluxe argues that that case is not relevant because it is distinguishable from the present case. The term `deluxe' can be descriptive or laudatory only in relation to the goods themselves and not in relation to the way in which they are sold, since there is no `deluxe' way of selling a product, especially if the relevant public is taken into account.</p>

            <p>By the second part of its single ground for appeal, EUIPO submits that the General Court's interpretation of a requirement of sufficient homogeneity, in paragraphs 20 to 22 and 26 of the judgment under appeal, which allows the Board of Appeal to adopt a general reasoning for refusing the application for registration of the mark at issue, does not comply with the case-law, in particular the order of 18 March 2010, CFCMCEE v OHIM ( C‑282/09 P, EU:C:2010:153). By establishing a correlation between the existence of a `homogeneous category' and the description of the goods and services, the General Court erroneously interprets the concept of `sufficiently homogeneous' `category' or `group' of goods or services within the meaning of that case-law and, consequently, the concept of `a sufficiently direct and specific link' that must exist between the goods and services.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, it is apparent from settled case-law that the competent authority cannot merely carry out a minimal assessment of an application for registration, but it must, on the contrary, carry out a stringent and full examination in order to prevent trade marks from being improperly registered (judgment of 6 May 2003, Libertel, C‑104/01, EU:C:2003:244, paragraph 59).</p>

            <p>Since registration of a mark is always sought for goods or services specified in the application for registration, the question whether registration can be refused on one of the absolute grounds must be assessed on the facts by reference to those goods or services (judgment of 15 February 2007, BVBA Management, Training en Consultancy, C‑239/05, EU:C:2007:99, paragraph 31).</p>

            <p>It must be recalled that, according to the Court's case-law, first, the examination of the absolute grounds for refusal must be carried out in relation to each of the goods or services for which trade mark registration is sought and, secondly, that the decision by which the competent authority refuses registration of a mark must, in principle, state reasons in respect of each of those goods or services (judgment of 15 February 2007, BVBA Management, Training en Consultancy, C‑239/05, EU:C:2007:99, paragraph 34, and order of 18 March 2010, CFCMCEE v OHIM, C‑282/09 P, EU:C:2010:153, paragraph 37).</p>

            <p>However, as regards that last requirement, the Court has stated that the competent authority may use only general reasoning for all of the goods and services concerned where the same ground for refusal is given for a category or group of goods or services (judgments of 15 February 2007, BVBA Management, Training en Consultancy, C‑239/05, EU:C:2007:99, paragraph 37, and of 17 October 2013, Isdin v Bial-Portela, C‑597/12 P, EU:C:2013:672, paragraph 26).</p>

            <p>The Court then made clear that such a power extends only to goods and services which are interlinked in a sufficiently direct and specific way, to the point where they form a sufficiently homogeneous category or group of goods or services (judgment of 17 October 2013, Isdin v Bial-Portela, C‑597/12 P, EU:C:2013:672, paragraph 27).</p>

            <p>In order to determine whether the goods and services covered by an application for registration of an EU mark are interlinked in a sufficiently direct and specific way and can be placed in sufficiently homogenous categories and groups, for the purposes of the case-law cited in the previous paragraph, account must be taken of the fact that the objective of that exercise is to enable and facilitate the assessment in concreto of the question whether or not the mark concerned by the application for registration comes under one of the absolute grounds for refusal, in accordance with the case-law cited in paragraph 28 of the present judgment.</p>

            <p>It follows from the foregoing considerations that it cannot be ruled out a priori that the goods and services covered by an application for registration all present a relevant characteristic for the analysis of an absolute ground for refusal and that they can be placed, for the purposes of examining the application for registration at issue in relation to that absolute ground for refusal, in a sufficiently homogenous single category or group, for the purposes of the case-law cited in paragraph 31 of the present judgment.</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is apparent from paragraph 26 of the judgment under appeal that, in relation to all the goods and services covered by the application for registration at issue, the Board of Appeal indicated that all the goods, without exception, can be presented as being of superior quality, and all the services, without exception, can be presented as providing superior quality. It follows from that consideration that the Board of Appeal, in essence, considered that all the goods and services covered by the application for registration under examination presented a characteristic which was relevant to the analysis of the absolute ground for refusal under Article 7(1)(b) of Regulation No 207/2009, namely the fact that they could be presented as having or providing superior quality and that, therefore, they were all part of a sufficiently homogenous single category or group, for the purposes of the analysis of that absolute ground for refusal. The relevance, according to the Board of Appeal, of that common characteristic of the goods and services at issue for the purposes of the analysis that it had to carry out is demonstrated by the finding in the decision at issue that the mark applied for consisted of a `claim of superior quality'.</p>

            <p>Second, it was for the General Court to check, in the context of the analysis of the word element of the mark applied for, whether the term `deluxe' did actually convey the concept of `superior quality' as claimed by the Board of Appeal, given that that word element amounts to a direct reference to the concept of `luxury'. If the term `deluxe' were to have a meaning distinct to that of `superior quality', as considered by the Advocate General in paragraph 54 to 55 of his Opinion, the General Court would then have to examine whether or not, in the light of that meaning, the goods and services covered by the mark at issue constitute a homogenous group justifying recourse to a general reasoning.</p>

The General Court therefore failed to have regard to the possibility that, despite their differences, all the goods and services at issue could have a common characteristic, relevant to the analysis that the Board of Appeal had to carry out, which, in accordance with the considerations set out in paragraphs 33 and 34 of the present judgment, could justify their placement within a single homogenous group and the use by the Board of Appeal of a general reasoning in relation to them.</p>
