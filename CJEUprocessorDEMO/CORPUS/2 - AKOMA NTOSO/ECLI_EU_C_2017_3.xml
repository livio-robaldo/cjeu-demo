            <p>It is apparent from the observations submitted by the Council and the Commission that roundnose grenadier and roughhead grenadier are two deep-sea species which, to the naked eye, are distinguishable one from the other only by the shape of the head. Once the head has been removed from fish of these species and they have been frozen, it is practically impossible to tell them apart.</p>

            <p>According to the Council and the Commission, the working group on biology and assessment of deep-sea fisheries within the ICES, which met from 4 to 11 April 2014, stated in its report for 2014 ( `the WGDEEP 2014 report') that it had learned of substantial catches of roughhead grenadier in recent years on the Hatton Bank, in particular by Spanish trawlers. Those institutions also state that the WGDEEP 2014 report mentioned substantial mismatches between observer and official Spanish data on landings of roundnose grenadier, raising concerns regarding possible misreporting of the various species of grenadier.</p>

            <p>The content of the WGDEEP 2014 report was discussed within the NEAFC Permanent Committee on management and science in September 2014. The Permanent Committee emphasised, in particular, that the level of reported roughhead grenadier fisheries compared to roundnose grenadier was `surprising', as roughhead catches had traditionally been small in comparison. ICES was asked to provide clarification, as far as possible, regarding those fisheries. In particular, ICES was asked to consider whether there were possible errors in the catch reporting or whether there was a new and/or rapidly growing fishery in roughhead grenadier.</p>

            <p>On 3 October 2014, the Commission submitted to the Council a proposal for a Council regulation fixing for 2015 and 2016 the fishing opportunities for Union fishing vessels for certain deep-sea fish stocks. In particular, the Commission proposed that, in each of the management zones in question, a TAC should be established covering both roundnose grenadier and roughhead grenadier. The TAC level established for both species together was based on scientific advice provided by ICES in relation to roundnose grenadier, there being no such advice in relation to roughhead grenadier. Similarly, national quotas distributing the common TACs were determined in accordance with the principle of relative stability of fishing activities in relation to roundnose grenadier alone.</p>

            <p>On 7 November 2014, ICES produced a scientific advice responding to the requests made by NEAFC and the Union ( `the ICES advice of 7 November 2014'). It is apparent from that advice that uncertainties existed in the species composition of reported grenadier catches of roundnose grenadier and roughhead grenadier. In so far as concerned the distribution and abundance of the two species of grenadier, ICES indicated that they occurred in different hydrological environments, the roughhead grenadier being associated with colder, more boreal waters.</p>

            <p>The ICES advice of 7 November 2014 emphasised that substantial catches of roughhead grenadier had been reported in management zone 8X14 and in part of management zone 5B67. On average, observed commercial catches of roundnose grenadier in Subareas VI and XII, belonging to those management zones, were three orders of magnitude larger than those of roughhead grenadier. However, ICES emphasised that there were considerable differences, of more than one order of magnitude, between the relative proportions of roundnose and roughhead grenadier reported in the official landings, on the one hand, and the observed catches and scientific surveys in the areas where roughhead grenadier fishing was currently occurring, on the other.</p>

            <p>The ICES advice of 7 November 2014 nevertheless stated that the available survey and observer data both provided inconclusive information, with limited spatial and temporal coverage.

            <p>On Monday 10 November 2014, the Council discussed the proposal for a regulation submitted by the Commission on 3 October 2014. On the basis of the Council's discussions and with the agreement of the Commission, the Presidency proposed a compromise text.

            <p>It is apparent from the observations submitted by the Council that, in practice, the additional amount was calculated on the basis of the average proportion of roughhead grenadier landings to roundnose grenadier landings. Accordingly, for management zone 5B67, since the ICES scientific advice suggested a TAC of 3794 tonnes for roundnose grenadier and the average annual landings of roughhead grenadier in that zone represented 5.7% of the average estimated annual landings of roundnose grenadier, the figure of 3794 tonnes was increased by 216 tonnes (5.7% of 3794 tonnes), giving a final quantity of 4010 tonnes. The same method was followed for management zone 8X14, where the average estimated annual landings of roughhead grenadier represented 25.6% of the average estimated annual landings of roundnose grenadier.</p>

            <p>criticises the Council for having based itself on incorrect data when it established a common TAC covering roundnose grenadier and roughhead grenadier on the ground that catches of roundnose grenadier `may be reported as catches of roughhead grenadier'. As evidenced by recital 7 in the preamble to Regulation No 1367/2014, that decision was adopted on the basis of the scientific advice and recent discussions in the NEAFC.

            <p>Moreover, in its advice of 7 November 2014, ICES stated that it was impossible to reach a conclusion regarding the existence of a roughhead grenadier fishery, as there was no information about catches of the different species of grenadier, since the data for 2010 were insufficient to enable any conclusions to be drawn on that point. It is also stated in that advice that there are considerable differences between the data concerning landings of catches of roughhead grenadier and roundnose grenadier. The ICES accordingly concluded that, in order to establish a fishery for roughhead grenadier, it was necessary to obtain more complete and detailed information on catches and landings. It is thus clear from that advice that there is no clear scientific data supporting a conclusion that both species occurred in management zones 5B67 and 8X14.</p>

            <p>As regards, first of all, the Council's allegedly exceeding the bounds of its discretion, it should first be borne in mind that when it is fixing TACs and allocating fishing opportunities among the Member States, the Council has to evaluate a complex economic situation. In such circumstances, the Council's discretion is not limited to the nature and scope of the measures to be taken but extends, to some degree, to the finding of the basic facts. In reviewing the exercise of such a power, the Court must confine itself to examining whether there has been a manifest error or misuse of power or whether the authority in question has clearly exceeded the bounds of its discretion (see to that effect, judgments of 19 February 1998, NIFPO and Northern Ireland Fishermen's Federation, C‑4/96, EU:C:1998:67, paragraphs 41 and 42; 5 October 1999,</p>

            <p>It should be noted in that regard that the present case is distinguishable on a number of points from other cases which to date have been brought before the Court concerning the CFP. To begin with, the two fish species in question are indistinguishable from one another to the naked eye once the head has been removed from the fish and it has been frozen. Next, the scientific advice available to the European Union legislature refers to the possibility that high reported catches of roughhead grenadier originating principally from a single Member State, namely the</p>
            <p>
              <organization refersTo="#institution_34">Kingdom of Spain</organization>
            </p>

Lastly, the Council did not establish a new TAC for roughhead grenadier and therefore did not allocate a new fishing possibility, but merely established, for 2015 and 2016 only, a common TAC for both species.</p>

            <p>, whilst its taking account of reported catches of roughhead grenadier submitted by that Member State for the calculation of the quotas in question had the effect of creating a lasting advantage for a Member State whose catch reports may, according to scientific advice, be incorrect. By contrast, in taking the approach it did, consisting initially of not taking account of those catches as reported in the calculation of national quotas, the Council avoided providing assurances in that regard that were liable to give rise to a legitimate expectation, whilst retaining the right to establish, once the information on reported catches had been verified and conclusive scientific advice had been lodged, quotas based on established data which could therefore be considered equitable quotas.</p>

            <p>criticises the Council for having infringed the principle of equal treatment by establishing unilaterally a common TAC covering roundnose grenadier and roughhead grenadier whilst, in similar cases, the EU institutions have either observed the principle of relative stability of fishing activities by taking account of the Member States' historic catch quotas for establishing the TAC, or did not establish common TACs when one of the Member States opposed it.</p>

            <p>Thus, first of all, in 2011, following discussions concerning the inclusion of a new species, the demersal redfish, in the TAC covering redfish, the Commission took account of the allegations of the Federal Republic of Germany and the Republic of Estonia relating to the establishment of the TAC for demersal redfish. Next, the Commission, which has been planning to establish a TAC for sea bass since 2012, when faced with opposition from certain Member States including Ireland, stated that a TAC would be established for that species taking account of the historic catches of each Member State, in accordance with the principle of relative stability of fishing activities, and allowed the Member States to negotiate freely an agreement liable to suit each of them. Lastly, and continuing in its efforts to reach a consensus, the Commission has for several years encouraged the</p>

            <p>Regarding the principle of equal treatment, it should be borne in mind that, according to settled case-law, the second subparagraph of Article 40(2) TFEU, which prohibits all discrimination in the context of the common agricultural and fisheries policy, is merely a specific expression of the general principle of equal treatment, which requires that comparable situations must not be treated differently and different situations must not be treated alike unless such treatment is objectively justified (see, to that effect, judgment of 14 November 2013, SFIR and Others, C‑187/12 to C‑189/12, EU:C:2013:737, paragraph 48 and the case-law cited).</p>
