In contrast, in the Czech, Danish, Latvian, Hungarian, Romanian, Slovak, Slovenian and Swedish language versions of Article 5, the expression `in the Community' relates to both the manufacture and the placing on the market of the substances.

That directive provides in Article 1(1) and (3), first, that its purpose is to approximate the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States on the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances which are placed on the market in the Member States of the Community and, second, that it does not apply to dangerous substances exported to third countries.

            <p>Pursuant to Article 129(3) of the REACH Regulation, if, in the case of a Commission decision authorising provisional measures for a defined period of time, the provisional measure taken by the Member State consists of a restriction on the placing on the market or use of a substance, the Member State concerned is to initiate a Community restrictions procedure by submitting to the Agency a dossier, in accordance with Annex XV to that regulation, within three months of the date of the Commission decision. Annex XV lays down general principles for preparing dossiers to propose and justify in particular the restrictions on the manufacture, placing on the market or use of a substance within the Community. It is therefore apparent that the expression `placing on the market' in Article 129(3) of the REACH Regulation relates only to the internal market and does not cover exports to third countries.</p>

            <p>In that context, recital 1 to the REACH regulation indicates that the latter should ensure, in particular, the free movement of goods.

Recital 2 of that regulation states that the efficient functioning of the internal market for substances can be achieved only if requirements for substances do not differ significantly from Member State to Member State. According to recital 7 of that regulation, to preserve the integrity of the internal market and to ensure a high level of protection for human health, especially the heath of workers, and the environment, it is necessary to ensure that manufacturing of substances in the Community complies with Community law, even if those substances are exported.</p>
