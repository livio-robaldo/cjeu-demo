            <p>Bankia submits that the reference for a preliminary ruling is inadmissible on the ground that the referring court failed to comply with the national procedural rules. In the context of the dispute in the main proceedings, Ms Porras Guisado claimed breach of Directive 92/85 only on appeal.

            <p>In view of the risk to the physical and mental state of pregnant workers, workers who have recently given birth or who are breastfeeding, protection by way of reparation, even if it leads to the reintegration of the worker dismissed and the payment of wages not received because of dismissal, cannot replace protection by way of prevention.</p>

            <p>As a result, in order to ensure the faithful transposition Article 10 of Directive 92/85, and the protection of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding from the risk of dismissal, Member States cannot confine themselves to providing, by way of reparation, only for that dismissal to be declared void when it is not justified.</p>

            <p>Having regard to the above considerations, the answer to the third question is that Article 10(1) of Directive 92/85 must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which does not prohibit, in principle, the dismissal of a worker who is pregnant, has recently given birth or is breastfeeding, as a preventative measure, but which provides, by way of reparation, only for such a dismissal to be declared void when it is unlawful.</p>

              <p>The second and fourth questions</p>
            </tblock>
            <p>67 By its second and fourth questions, which it is appropriate to examine together and last, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 10(1) of Directive 92/85 must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which, in the context of a collective redundancy within the meaning of Directive 98/59, makes no provision for pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding to be afforded, prior to that dismissal, priority status in relation to being either retained or reassigned to another post.</p>

            <p>According to Article 10(1) of Directive 92/85, Member States `shall take the necessary measures' to prohibit, in principle, the dismissal of workers during the period from the beginning of their pregnancy to the end of the maternity leave.</p>

            <p>As regards whether pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding are to have priority for retention, in its decision the referring court notes that, according to Spanish legislation, workers' legal representatives are to have priority as regards being retained in the undertaking over other workers affected by the collective redundancy procedure, and workers belonging to other groups, such as workers with dependants, older workers or workers with disabilities, may also enjoy priority status in relation to being retained when that has been agreed through negotiation.</p>

            <p>The referring court infers from that regulation that pregnant workers enjoy priority status in relation to being retained in the undertaking only when such a status is agreed through collective bargaining. The referring court adds that workers with priority status for being retained may be dismissed, but that, in such a case, the employer must justify exceptional grounds different to those on which the collective redundancy is based.</p>

            <p>In the present case, in accordance with the answer given to the first question, Article 10(1) of Directive 92/85 must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which permits the dismissal of a pregnant worker because of a collective redundancy within the meaning of Article 1(1)(a) of Directive 98/59.</p>

            <p>In that regard it is true, as noted by the European Commission, that Directive 92/85 -- in particular Article 10(1) -- does not require Member States to grant pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding priority status for retention and redeployment, applicable prior to the collective redundancy.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, that directive, which only contains minimum requirements, in no way prevents Member States from providing higher protection for pregnant workers, workers who have recently given birth and workers who are breastfeeding (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 October 2001, Jiménez Melgar, C‑438/99, EU:C:2001:509, paragraph 37).</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 10(1) of Council Directive 92/85/EEC of 19 October 1992 on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health at work of pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or are breastfeeding (tenth individual Directive within the meaning of Article 16(1) of Directive 89/391/EEC) must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which permits the dismissal of a pregnant worker because of a collective redundancy within the meaning of Article 1(1)(a) of Directive 98/59/EC of 20 July 1998 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to collective redundancies. 2. Article 10(2) of Directive 92/85 must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which allows an employer to dismiss a pregnant worker in the context of a collective redundancy without giving any grounds other than those justifying the collective dismissal, provided that the objective criteria chosen to identify the workers to be made redundant are cited. 3. Article 10(1) of Directive 92/85 must be interpreted as precluding national legislation which does not prohibit, in principle, the dismissal of a worker who is pregnant, has recently given birth or is breastfeeding as a preventative measure, but which provides, by way of reparation, only for that dismissal to be declared void when it is unlawful. 4. Article 10(1) of Directive 92/85 must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation which, in the context of a collective redundancy within the meaning of Directive 98/59, makes no provision for pregnant workers and workers who have recently given birth or who are breastfeeding to be afforded, prior to that dismissal, priority status in relation to being either retained or redeployed, but as not excluding the right of Member States to provide for a higher level of protection for such workers.</p>
