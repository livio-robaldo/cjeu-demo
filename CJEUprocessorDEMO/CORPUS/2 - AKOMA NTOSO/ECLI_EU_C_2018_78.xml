            <p>Still through its General Representative for Italy, Lloyd's brought fresh proceedings against the decisions at issue before the referring court. In support of those proceedings, Lloyd's submitted that it is a `collective legal person with multiple structures', forming a recognised grouping of natural and legal persons (the members) who act independently within individual groups, called syndicates, which operate independently from one another and in competition with one another whilst belonging to the same organisation. It argued that none of the internal structures has autonomous legal personality but acts through the General Representative who, for each country, is the sole representative for all syndicates operating in that territory.</p>

            <p>Arpacal argued, for its part, that several factors suggest that both tenders are attributable to a single decision-making centre, namely the use of identical forms, the single signature of the same person as the Special Agent of the General Representative for Italy, the fact that the official stamps on both financial tenders bear consecutive numbers and the fact that the statements and declarations are identical. This, it was claimed, resulted in infringement of the principles of the confidentiality of tenders, fair and free competition, and equal treatment of tenderers.</p>

            <p>The referring court observes that, according to national case-law, where several syndicates of Lloyd's participate in the same call for tenders, the fact that the applications to participate in the tender and the financial tenders of those syndicates are signed by Lloyd's General Representative for Italy entails no infringement either of Article 38(1)(m), quater, and</p>

                <p>of Legislative Decree No 163/2006, or of the principles of competition, independence and the confidentiality of tenders. That case-law has, in this regard, highlighted the particular structure of Lloyd's which, in accordance with United Kingdom rules and regulations, operates in different countries through a single General Representative. Likewise, in its Opinion No 110 of 9 April 2008, the Autorità di Vigilanza sui Contratti Pubblici (Supervisory Authority for Public Contracts, Italy), which has since become the Autorità Nazionale Anticorruzione (National Anti-Corruption Agency, Italy), stated that the independence of syndicates and competition between them serve to ensure free competition and the equal treatment of candidates.</p>

            <p>The referring court is uncertain, however, as to whether the Italian legislation at issue, as interpreted by national case-law, complies with EU law. Admittedly, Directive 2009/138 recognises Lloyd's as a particular form of insurance undertaking, the members of which are authorised to operate within the European Union through the intermediary of a single General Representative for the Member State concerned. However, even if the syndicates of Lloyd's operate independently of one another and in competition with one another, the fact remains that tendering procedures are governed by mandatory rules intended to ensure observance of equal treatment. It is certain that, when Lloyd's General Representative signs tenders submitted by syndicates, he is aware of their content. Consequently, the fact that the same person signs several tenders submitted by different tenderers may undermine the independence and confidentiality of those tenders and, as a result, infringe the principle of competition laid down, in particular, in Articles 101 and 102 TFEU.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the Tribunale amministrativo regionale per la Calabria (Regional Administrative Court, Calabria) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling: `Do the principles laid down by EU competition rules, as set out in the FEU Treaty, and the principles deriving therefrom, such as the independence and confidentiality of tenders, preclude national legislation, as interpreted by case-law, which allows the simultaneous participation, in the same tendering procedure launched by a contracting authority, of several syndicates of Lloyd's of London, whose tenders are signed by a single person, namely the General Representative for the Member State concerned?'</p>

            <p>It should be noted that, in the procedure established by Article 267 TFEU providing for cooperation between national courts and the Court of Justice, it is for the latter to provide the national court with an answer which will be of use to it and enable it to determine the case before it. To that end, the Court may have to reformulate the questions referred to it (see, in particular, judgment of 11 March 2008, Jager, C‑420/06, EU:C:2008:152, paragraph 46).</p>

            <p>In this case, the main proceedings concern a public service contract for insurance, in respect of which it is not specified whether the value reaches the threshold set by Directive 2004/18. It should be noted, however, that the award of contracts which, in view of their value, do not fall within the scope of that directive is nonetheless subject to the fundamental rules and the general principles of the FEU Treaty, in particular the principles of equal treatment and of non-discrimination on grounds of nationality and the consequent obligation of transparency, provided that those contracts have certain cross-border interest in the light of certain objective criteria (judgment of 16 April 2015, Enterprise Focused Solutions, C‑278/14, EU:C:2015:228, paragraph 16).</p>

            <p>Consequently, it must be considered that, by its question, the referring court is asking, in essence, whether the principles of transparency, equal treatment and non-discrimination, which derive from Articles 49 and 56 TFEU and are referred to in Article 2 of Directive 2004/18, must be interpreted as precluding legislation of a Member State, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which does not allow two syndicates of Lloyd's to be excluded from participation in the same procedure for the award of a public service contract for insurance merely because their tenders were each signed by Lloyd's General Representative for that Member State.</p>

            <p>In this regard, it should be stated at the outset that, while Directive 2004/18 was repealed by Directive 2014/24 with effect from 18 April 2016, it is apparent from settled case-law of the Court that the applicable directive is, as a rule, the one in force when the contracting authority chooses the type of procedure to be followed and decides definitively whether it is necessary for a prior call for competition to be issued for the award of a public contract. Conversely, a directive is not applicable if the period prescribed for its transposition expired after that point in time (see, inter alia, judgment of 14 September 2017, Casertana Costruzioni, C‑223/16, EU:C:2017:685, paragraph 21).</p>

            <p>It is common ground between all interested persons having submitted written observations that Lloyd's is a recognised grouping of members that are natural and legal persons, which members, whilst acting through individual groups -- the syndicates -- operate independently from one another and in competition with one another. However, given that none of the internal structures has autonomous legal personality, syndicates may only act through the General Representative, who is the sole representative for each country. Lloyd's also stated that these syndicates constitute neither a fixed structure nor a stable association of members but rather a grouping of members, the composition of which may vary, and that they each operate through a specific management body which issues decisions that are binding on them, although they do not have their own legal personality.</p>

            <p>In this regard, it must be noted that Article 45 of Directive 2004/18, which specifies the grounds for the exclusion of an economic operator from participation in a tendering procedure, does not provide for a ground for exclusion such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which is intended to prevent any risk of collusion between entities that are members of the same organisation. The grounds for exclusion provided for in that provision relate only to the professional qualities of the persons concerned (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 December 2008, Michaniki, C‑213/07, EU:C:2008:731, paragraphs 42 and 43).</p>

            <p>However, it is clear from the case-law of the Court that Article 45 of Directive 2004/18 does not preclude the option for Member States to maintain or establish, in addition to those grounds for exclusion, substantive rules intended, in particular, to ensure, with regard to public procurement, observance of the principles of equal treatment of all tenderers and of transparency, which constitute the basis of the EU directives on public procurement procedures, provided that the principle of proportionality is observed (judgment of 19 May 2009, Assitur, C‑538/07, EU:C:2009:317, paragraph 21).</p>

            <p>In that context, it is the concern of EU law to ensure the widest possible participation by tenderers in a call for tenders (see, to that effect, judgments of 19 May 2009, Assitur, C‑538/07, EU:C:2009:317, paragraph 26; of 23 December 2009, Serrantoni and Consorzio stabile edili, C‑376/08, EU:C:2009:808, paragraph 40; and of 22 October 2015, Impresa Edilux and SICEF, C‑425/14, EU:C:2015:721, paragraph 36).</p>

          <content eId="para_19593__content">
            <p>It thus follows, according to settled case-law of the Court, that the automatic exclusion of candidates or tenderers that are in a relationship of control or of association with other competitors goes beyond that which is necessary to prevent collusive behaviour and, as a result, to ensure the application of the principle of equal treatment and compliance with the obligation of transparency (see, to that effect, judgments of 19 May 2009, Assitur, C‑538/07, EU:C:2009:317, paragraph 28; of 23 December 2009, Serrantoni and Consorzio stabile edili, C‑376/08, EU:C:2009:808, paragraphs 38 and 40; and of 22 October 2015, Impresa Edilux and SICEF, C‑425/14, EU:C:2015:721, paragraphs 36 and 38).</p>

            <p>Such an automatic exclusion constitutes an irrebuttable presumption of mutual interference in the respective tenders, for the same contract, of undertakings linked by a relationship of control or of association. Accordingly, it precludes the possibility for those candidates or tenderers of showing that their tenders are independent and is therefore contrary to the EU interest in ensuring the widest possible participation by tenderers in a call for tenders (see, to that effect, judgments of 19 May 2009, Assitur, C‑538/07, EU:C:2009:317, paragraphs 29 and 30; of 23 December 2009, Serrantoni and Consorzio stabile edili, C‑376/08, EU:C:2009:808, paragraphs 39 and 40; and of 22 October 2015, Impresa Edilux and SICEF, C‑425/14, EU:C:2015:721, paragraph 36).</p>

            <p>It should be pointed out in this regard that the Court has already held that groups of undertakings can have different forms and objectives, which do not necessarily preclude controlled undertakings from enjoying a certain autonomy in the conduct of their commercial policy and their economic activities, inter alia, in the area of their participation in the award of public contracts. Relationships between undertakings in the same group may in fact be governed by specific provisions such as to guarantee both independence and confidentiality in the drawing-up of tenders which may be submitted simultaneously by the undertakings in question in the same tendering procedure (judgment of 19 May 2009, Assitur, C‑538/07, EU:C:2009:317, paragraph 31).</p>

          <content eId="para_19596__content">
            <p>Observance of the principle of proportionality therefore requires that the contracting authority be required to examine and assess the facts, in order to determine whether the relationship between two entities has actually influenced the respective content of the tenders submitted in the same tendering procedure, a finding of such influence, in any form, being sufficient for those undertakings to be excluded from the procedure (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 May 2009, Assitur, C‑538/07, EU:C:2009:317, paragraph 32).</p>

            <p>As a result, in this case, the mere fact that tenders such as those in the main proceedings have been signed by the same person, namely the Special Agent of Lloyd's General Representative for Italy, cannot justify their automatic exclusion from the tendering procedure at issue.</p>

            <p>The distinction made in that regard by Arpacal in its written observations, dependent on whether the signature relates to the candidates' applications to participate in the tender procedures or to the financial tenders themselves, is irrelevant. In any event, such a signature, even assuming that it involves the Special Agent and/or Lloyd's General Representative being aware of the content of the tenders, does not prove per se that the syndicates consulted one another as to the content of their respective tenders and that, as a result, the relationships between them, together with the involvement of the Special Agent for Lloyd's General Representative, actually influenced those tenders. The same applies to the other factors raised by Arpacal, at paragraph 18 of the present judgment.</p>
