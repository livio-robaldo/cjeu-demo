            <p>The dispute in the main proceedings concerns the assignment of radio frequencies for digital terrestrial television broadcasting for the benefit of operators which already had analogue broadcasting radio frequencies and operated analogue channels. Digital technology is characterised by its superior transmission efficiency compared with that of analogue technology in that, unlike analogue, it allows the simultaneous transmission of a number of programmes on the same radio frequency. The radio frequencies thus freed up constitute the `digital dividend'.</p>

            <p>In Italy, the transition from analogue television to digital television ( `the digital transition') began when proceedings against that Member State for failure to fulfil its obligations had been pending since 2006; those proceedings concerned the compatibility of Italian legislation on the management of radio frequencies for television broadcasting, digital transition and the assignment of digital radio frequencies, with the provisions of the Framework Directive and the Authorisation and Competition Directives. In a reasoned opinion of 19 July 2007, the European Commission, in essence, found that that legislation, by allowing only operators which were already broadcasting in analogue mode to have access to the digital radio and television market, shielded them from competition on that market. The Italian Government adopted a number measures in order to make that legislation compatible with EU law.</p>

By that decision, AGCOM laid down the criteria for the complete digitalisation of the terrestrial networks for television.</p>

For the purposes of allocating those multiplexes among the new operators, the operators which had created digital networks and the operators which already managed analogue networks, those multiplexes were divided into three groups to be assigned in accordance with different criteria. In addition, it was also stipulated that, at the end of the selection procedure, no operator could obtain more than five national multiplexes.</p>

            <p>Only one of those three groups is the subject of the main proceedings. That group is composed of eight multiplexes which were intended to be used for the conversion of existing analogue channels into digital networks. Given the number of digital radio frequencies available, which was below the number of channels, Decision 181/09/CONS used the so-called `fair' conversion criterion, based on the continuity of programmes broadcast in analogue. In addition, it was stipulated that each operator already active on the analogue market was to be assigned at least one multiplex. On that basis, three multiplexes were assigned to single network operators. Five multiplexes were allocated among the multi-network operators. In that way, Radiotelevisione italiana SpA (RAI) and Mediaset, which each ran three analogue channels, were assigned two multiplexes, while Telecom Italia Media Broadcasting, which ran two analogue channels, received one multiplex.</p>

            <p>Before the referring court, Persidera challenges, inter alia, the criterion applied in order to convert the existing analogue channels into digital networks. It relies on a number of provisions of EU law and claims that the principles of equal treatment and proportionality have been infringed. First, it claims that it had a 50% conversion factor applied to it, as only one analogue channel out of two was converted into a digital network, while RAI and Mediaset had the benefit of a 66% conversion factor, as two analogue channels out of three were converted into digital networks. Secondly, it takes issue with the fact that, as regards those two operators, unlawfully operated channels were taken into consideration for the purposes of the conversion.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be borne in mind that, in the context of the cooperation between the Court and the national courts provided for in Article 267 TFEU, it is solely for the national court before which a dispute has been brought, and which must assume responsibility for the subsequent judicial decision, to determine in the light of the particular circumstances of the case both the need for a preliminary ruling in order to enable it to deliver judgment and the relevance of the questions which it submits to the Court. Consequently, where the questions submitted concern the interpretation of EU law, the Court is in principle bound to give a ruling (judgment of 6 September 2016, Petruhhin, C‑182/15, EU:C:2016:630, paragraph 19 and the case-law cited).</p>

The Court may refuse to rule on a question referred for a preliminary ruling by a national court only where it is quite obvious that the interpretation of EU law that is sought bears no relation to the actual facts of the main action or its purpose, where the problem is hypothetical, or where the Court does not have before it the factual or legal material necessary to give a useful answer to the questions submitted to it (judgments of 14 April 2016, Polkomtel, C‑397/14, EU:C:2016:256, paragraph 37 and the case-law cited, and of 13 October 2016, Prezes Urzędu Komunikacji Elektronicznej and Petrotel, C‑231/15, EU:C:2016:769, paragraph 16).</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is clear from the order for reference that the action brought by Persidera seeks, not only the assignment of an additional multiplex, but also an award for damages. By its action, Persidera disputes the compatibility with EU law of the rules applied to the conversion of the analogue channels into digital networks, and the questions asked are specifically intended to ensure that the referring court is able to assess that compatibility and the claim for damages. In those circumstances, it is not obvious that the dispute in the main proceedings is hypothetical.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it must be recalled that the need to provide an interpretation of EU law which will be of use to the national court means that the national court is bound to observe scrupulously the requirements concerning the content of a request for a preliminary ruling, expressly set out in Article 94 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, of which the referring court should be aware (see, to that effect, judgments of 5 July 2016, Ognyanov, C‑614/14, EU:C:2016:514, paragraphs 18 and 19 and the case-law cited, and of 27 October 2016, Audace and Others, C‑114/15, EU:C:2016:813, paragraph 35).</p>

            <p>Thus, it is essential, as is stated in Article 94(c) of the Rules of Procedure, that the reference for a preliminary ruling itself must contain a statement of the reasons which prompted the national court to inquire about the interpretation or validity of certain provisions of EU law, and the relationship between those provisions and the national legislation applicable to the case before the referring court.</p>

The questions concern the issue whether analogue channels which were allegedly operated irregularly may be taken into account in the same way as regularly operated channels for the purposes of their conversion into digital networks. As the Advocate General stated in points 37 to 40 of her Opinion, the Court is in a position to provide a useful answer to the referring court on the basis of the information in the file sent by that court, and by starting from the factual premiss, which only that court may, as appropriate, cast doubt upon, that analogue channels were operated irregularly or unlawfully in the light of national law and/or the provisions of the NCRF.</p>

            <p>First, it must be stated, as did the Advocate General in point 53 of her Opinion, that operators such as Persidera, RAI and Mediaset which operated digital networks in Italy are, in principle, in a comparable situation for the purposes of the conversion of those channels into digital networks at the time of the digital transfer.</p>

            <p>Secondly, it is clear from the information submitted to the Court that the analogue channels operated by those multi-network operators were converted into digital networks in accordance with the so-called `fair' conversion criterion referred to in paragraph 16 above. Thus, it is apparent from the order for reference that the number of channels operated by each operator was converted into as many digital networks after subtracting one channel. Consequently, Persidera, which operated two analogue channels, was assigned one digital network, while RAI and Mediaset, which each operated three analogue channels, received two digital networks apiece. In other words, whereas the conversion rate applied to both Rai and Mediaset was 66.67%, each of them having been awarded two digital networks for their three analogue channels, the conversion rate applied to Persidera was only 50%, since it was awarded only one digital network for its two analogue channels. The application of the same measure of removing an analogue channel during the digital conversion thus resulted in the application of different conversion rates which affected Persidera more than RAI and Mediaset.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, as the Advocate General stated in points 54 to 57 of her Opinion, it must be considered that a national provision such as the one at issue in the main proceedings amounts to a difference in treatment between competing operators placed in a comparable situation.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, it is apparent from the observations submitted to the Court that the so-called `fair' conversion criterion was justified by the need to ensure the continuity of television output. In addition, the difference in treatment was caused by the physical constraints connected with the fact that it is technically impossible to divide the radio frequencies.</p>

            <p>In that regard, as the Advocate General stated in point 64 of her Opinion, it must be considered that the continuity of television output contributes to consumer protection which, moreover, is expressly listed among the objectives laid down in Article 8(4) of the Framework Directive. Therefore, the aim of the continuity of television output may be taken into account by the NRAs during the conversion of the existing analogue channels into digital networks, whilst ensuring that that conversion is consistent with all the objectives referred to in Article 8 of the Framework Directive and the need for effective management of the radio frequencies, as is required by Article 9(1) of that directive.</p>

            <p>However, a measure which would lead to operators already present on the market being assigned a number of digital radio frequencies which is greater than the number that is sufficient to ensure the continuity of their television output would go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective and would, thus, be disproportionate.</p>

            <p>It is necessary to point out again that, during the conversion of the existing analogue channels into digital networks, the NRA must take into consideration the physical constraints connected with the fact that it is technically impossible to divide the radio frequencies at issue. In such a situation, the aim of encouraging efficient use and ensuring the effective management of radio frequencies, as provided for, in particular, in Article 8(2)(d) of the Framework Directive, may, for the purposes of avoiding fractional results, justify the assignment of a lower or a higher number of digital networks compared with the number of analogue channels operated.</p>

            <p>In the present case, it follows from the information submitted to the Court that a digital multiplex makes it possible to transmit five to six channels with a quality of transmission that is identical to that of analogue transmission, or to transmit three digital channels in high definition, that is to say, with more advanced technology. As the Advocate General stated in point 67 of her Opinion and subject to verification by the referring court, it thus appears that a single multiplex may have been sufficient to enable operators such as RAI and Mediaset to ensure the continuity of their three analogue channels with a comparable quality, and that the assignment of a second multiplex went beyond what was necessary for that purpose. In addition, as is apparent from point 79 of the Opinion, preserving the indivisibility of radio frequencies does not appear to justify sufficiently the difference in treatment at issue in the main proceedings, that being a matter for the referring court to determine.</p>

The continuity of television output constitutes a legitimate objective capable of justifying such a difference in treatment. However, a provision which would lead to operators already present on the market being assigned a number of digital radio frequencies which is greater than the number that is sufficient to ensure the continuity of their television output would go beyond what is necessary to achieve that objective and would, thus, be disproportionate.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 9 of Directive 2002/21/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on a common regulatory framework for electronic communications networks and services (Framework Directive), as amended by Directive 2009/140/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 November 2009, Articles 3, 5 and 7 of Directive 2002/20/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 7 March 2002 on the authorisation of electronic communications networks and services (Authorisation Directive), as amended by Directive 2009/140, and Articles 2 and 4 of Directive 2002/77/EC of 16 September 2002 on competition in the markets for electronic communications networks and services must be interpreted to the effect that they preclude a national provision which, for the purposes of converting existing analogue channels into digital networks, takes into consideration unlawfully managed analogue channels, where that leads to an unfair competitive advantage being prolonged, or even reinforced. 2. The principles of non-discrimination and proportionality must be interpreted to the effect that they preclude a national provision which, on the basis of the same conversion criterion, leads to a proportionately larger reduction in the number of digital networks assigned compared with the number of analogue channels operated to the detriment of one operator compared to its competitors, unless it is objectively justified and proportionate to its objective. The continuity of television output constitutes a legitimate objective capable of justifying such a difference in treatment.
