            <p>In those circumstances the Vestre Landsret (Western Regional Court, Denmark) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling: `In the circumstances of the present case, can parts from end-of-life vehicles which a VAT-registered vehicle reuse undertaking removes from a vehicle with a view to resale as spare parts be regarded as second-hand goods as referred to in Article 311(1)(1) of [Directive 2006/112]?'</p>

            <p>By its question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 311(1)(1) of Directive 2006/112 must be interpreted as meaning that used parts, from end-of-life motor vehicles purchased by a vehicle reuse undertaking from a private individual, intended to be sold as spare parts, constitute `second-hand goods' within the meaning of that provision, with the result that the supplies of such parts, effected by a taxable dealer, are subject to the application of the profit margin scheme.</p>

            <p>The Danish Government's argument that the characterisation as `second-hand goods', within the meaning of Article 311(1)(1) of Directive 2006/112, presupposes that the property purchased retains its identity as the property sold, which would not be the case where a complete motor vehicle is purchased and the parts removed from that vehicle are resold, cannot call such an interpretation into question. The Danish Government contends that the parts removed from a used vehicle were produced when the waste from the vehicle was treated. They did not, therefore, retain their identity between the time when they were purchased by the undertaking as parts of an end-of-life vehicle and when they were sold as spare parts.</p>

            <p>Making transactions for the supply of such spare parts effected by a taxable dealer subject to VAT would lead to double taxation, in so far as, first, the sale price of those parts necessarily already takes account of input VAT paid at the time of the vehicle's purchase by a person falling within Article 314(a) of Directive 2006/112 and, secondly, neither that person nor the taxable dealer was able to deduct that amount (see judgment of 3 March 2011, Auto Nikolovi, C‑203/10, EU:C:2011:118, paragraph 48 and the case-law cited).</p>

Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules: Article 311(1)(1) of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax must be interpreted as meaning that used parts, from end-of-life motor vehicles purchased by a vehicle reuse undertaking from a private individual, intended to be sold as spare parts, constitute `second-hand goods' within the meaning of that provision, with the result that the supplies of such parts, effected by a taxable dealer, are subject to the application of the profit margin scheme.</p>
