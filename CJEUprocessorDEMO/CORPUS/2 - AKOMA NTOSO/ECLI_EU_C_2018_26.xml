            <p>The version of Directive 91/477 applicable at the material time is the version resulting from the amendments that were made to the directive's original wording by Directive 2008/51 after the European Union acceded to the Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Their Parts and Components and Ammunition, annexed to the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organised Crime and adopted by Resolution 55/255 of the General Assembly of 8 June 2001. Directive 2008/51 was adopted on the basis of Article 95(1) EC, the content of which corresponds, in essence, to that of Article 100a(1) of the EEC Treaty, on which Directive 91/477 is based, and to that of Article 114(1) TFEU which is currently in force.</p>

            <p>Mr Buhagiar and Others are members of the Gibraltar Target Shooting Association. On 19 May 2015, Mr Buhagiar, as president of that association, wrote to the Minister requesting that he issue a pass to each of the claimants in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>On 2 June 2015 the Minister replied that, in the light of the position of both the Commission and the United Kingdom Government that Directive 91/477 does not apply on the territory of Gibraltar because it is intended to facilitate the free movement of goods, the Gibraltar Government had decided not to transpose it. Consequently, his response was that he was unable to issue the passes requested. In view of that refusal, Mr Buhagiar and Others brought proceedings before the Supreme Court of Gibraltar.</p>

            <p>According to that court, EU law applies fully on the territory of Gibraltar, on the basis of Article 355(3) TFEU, subject to the exceptions laid down in Articles 28 to 30 of the 1972 Act of Accession. By virtue of Article 29 of the 1972 Act of Accession, read in conjunction with point 4 of Section I of Annex I thereto, Gibraltar is excluded from the customs territory of the European Union and the Court has already stated in this connection that the application of directives which have Article 114 or Article 115 TFEU as their legal basis and the free movement of goods as their principal objective is excluded on the territory of Gibraltar.</p>

            <p>However, the claimants in the main proceedings maintain, first of all, that, in the light of the objective of the exclusions laid down by the 1972 Act of Accession, which have to be interpreted restrictively, measures of EU law on the free movement of goods that do not undermine the purpose of those exclusions must apply on the territory of Gibraltar. That is so in the case of the provisions of Directive 91/477 relating to the pass which are intended to benefit hunters and sports target shooters, as such a document is issued for the exclusive purpose of travel to and from Member States, in order to enable those persons to participate in sporting events. Issue of the pass is unrelated to commercial transactions in respect of the goods that it concerns, namely firearms.</p>

            <p>The claimants in the main proceedings submit, next, that the provisions of Directive 91/477 relating to the pass are intended to facilitate the freedom of hunters and sports target shooters to provide services and receive services between Member States. On that ground, those provisions are applicable on the territory of Gibraltar, which means that the competent authorities are obliged to transpose them in a national legal measure applicable on that territory. The failure to transpose them results in discrimination against hunters and sports target shooters resident in Gibraltar, who have to incur extra expenditure and administrative delays when travelling in the European Union with their firearms in order to take part in hunting or target shooting events and competitions, which amounts to an infringement of Article 56 TFEU. The firearms used in such a context cannot be viewed as goods involved in trade, but must be regarded as sporting equipment necessary for the purpose of such events or competitions.</p>

            <p>Finally, Mr Buhagiar and Others contend that the provisions of Directive 91/477 relating to the pass concern the free movement of persons, as its seventh recital confirms. To that extent, Directive 91/477, since it was adopted on the basis of Article 100a(1) of the EEC Treaty, is founded on an incorrect legal basis. In accordance with Article 100a(2) of the EEC Treaty, the content of which corresponds, in essence, to that of Article 95(2) EC and that of Article 114(2) TFEU, the legislative procedure referred to in paragraph 1 of each of those articles cannot be followed for the adoption of EU acts relating to the free movement of persons. Consequently, the claimants in the main proceedings dispute the validity of the provisions of Directive 91/477 relating to the pass, or even that of the directive in its entirety.</p>

            <p>By its three questions, which it is appropriate to examine together, the referring court requests the Court to specify the implications of Gibraltar's exclusion from the customs territory of the European Union, as referred to in Article 29 of the 1972 Act of Accession, read in conjunction with point 4 of Section I of Annex I thereto, and to examine, in that context, whether the provisions of Directive 91/477 relating to the pass are applicable on the territory of Gibraltar in so far as they concern hunters and sports target shooters.</p>

            <p>As preliminary points, it should be stated, first, in the light of the subject matter of the main proceedings, namely the refusal of the request of Mr Buhagiar and Others to be issued with passes in order to be able to rely on them under the simplified procedure for the transfer of firearms between Member States by hunters and sports target shooters, that the provision of Directive 91/477 which, according to them, should have been transposed on the territory of Gibraltar is the provision relating to use of the pass in such a context, that is to say, Article 12(2) of that directive, read in conjunction with Article 1(4) thereof and Annex II thereto. The latter two provisions define, respectively, the concept of the pass and its content.</p>

            <p>Second, whilst EU law applies, in principle, on the territory of Gibraltar pursuant to Article 355(3) TFEU, certain EU acts do not, however, apply there, under the 1972 Act of Accession, on account of the special legal position of that territory, in particular its status as a free port (see, to that effect, judgments of 21 July 2005, Commission v United Kingdom, C‑349/03, EU:C:2005:488, paragraph 41, and of 13 June 2017, The Gibraltar Betting and Gaming Association, C‑591/15, EU:C:2017:449, paragraphs 29 and 30).</p>

            <p>As the Court has already held in paragraph 59 of the judgment of 23 September 2003, Commission v United Kingdom ( C‑30/01, EU:C:2003:489), the exclusion of Gibraltar from the customs territory of the European Union, laid down in Article 29 of the 1972 Act of Accession, read in conjunction with point 4 of Section I of Annex I thereto, implies that neither the Treaty rules on the free movement of goods nor the rules of secondary EU legislation intended, as regards the free movement of goods, to ensure approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States pursuant to Articles 94 and 95 of the EC Treaty, now Articles 114 and 115 TFEU, are applicable to Gibraltar.</p>

            <p>That conclusion was not affected by the fact that the directives at issue in the case giving rise to that judgment, whose main objective was to remove barriers to trade in goods and which were based on Articles 94 and 95 of the EC Treaty, contained provisions relating to environmental protection, a field in which rules of EU law apply, in principle, on the territory of Gibraltar (see, in that regard, judgment of 23 September 2003, Commission v United Kingdom, C‑30/01, EU:C:2003:489, paragraphs 61 and 62).</p>

          <content eId="para_10445__content">
            <p>The Court has explained in that regard that it is true that failure to apply such directives on the territory of Gibraltar is liable to endanger the coherence of other EU policies when those directives also pursue, albeit as an ancillary aim, objectives connected with those other policies, such as environmental protection policy. Nevertheless, the existence of such a risk cannot lead to the extension of the territorial scope of those directives -- which pursue, as their main aim, objectives connected with the free movement of goods -- beyond the limits imposed by the Treaties and by the 1972 Act of Accession (see, to that effect, judgment of 23 September 2003, Commission v United Kingdom, C‑30/01, EU:C:2003:489, paragraph 63).</p>

            <p>It follows from those considerations that, first, where the main aim of an EU act is to ensure approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the Member States as regards the free movement of goods, in accordance with Articles 114 and 115 TFEU, that act cannot be applicable on the territory of Gibraltar even if it pursues, as an ancillary aim, one or more objectives connected with other EU policies.</p>

            <p>Second, contrary to the view that Mr Buhagiar and Others seem to hold, and as the Advocate General has observed in points 54 and 55 of his Opinion, examination of the main objective of an EU act is relevant for the purpose of determining whether that act is applicable on a territory excluded from the territorial scope of EU law in a given field.</p>

            <p>By its questions, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 29 of the 1972 Act of Accession, read in conjunction with point 4 of Section I of Annex I thereto, must be interpreted as meaning that Article 12(2) of Directive 91/477, read in conjunction with Article 1(4) thereof and Annex II thereto, applies on the territory of Gibraltar, either on the ground that it is intended to facilitate the freedom to provide services or the free movement of persons or on the ground that, although it concerns the free movement of goods, it relates neither to trade nor to commercial transactions concerning firearms.</p>

If examination of the measure concerned reveals that it pursues a twofold purpose or that it has a twofold component and if one of those is identifiable as the main or predominant purpose or component, whereas the other is merely incidental, that measure must be founded on a single legal basis, namely that required by the main or predominant purpose or component (judgment of 6 May 2014, Commission v Parliament and Council, C‑43/12, EU:C:2014:298, paragraphs 29 and 30 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>As regards the aim of Directive 91/477, it is apparent from its second to fourth recitals that it was adopted in order to establish the internal market and that, in that context, the abolition of controls on the safety of objects transported and of those on persons entailed, among other things, the approximation of legislation by means of effective rules on firearms designed to establish controls, within Member States, on their acquisition, possession and transfer (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 September 2014, Zeman, C‑543/12, EU:C:2014:2143, paragraphs 42 and 43).

That provision further states that a pass is to be non-transferable and is to record the firearm or firearms possessed and used by its holder, and that it must always be in the possession of the person using the firearm, whilst its content is further defined in Annex II to the directive.</p>

Article 12(1) of the directive provides that, if the procedure provided for in Article 11 is not employed, the possession of a firearm during a journey through two or more Member States is not to be permitted unless the person concerned has obtained the authorisation of each of those Member States, and such authorisation must be entered on the pass.</p>

            <p>Nonetheless, the EU legislature wished certain transfers of firearms not necessarily to be the subject of such an authorisation, since it may be established that they pose a lesser risk for public safety. These include the transfers envisaged in Article 11(3) of Directive 91/477, carried out by certain dealers. Enjoyment of that regime is conditional upon the grant of a specific authorisation, which is additional to the rigorous controls on the activity of dealers that are provided for in Article 4(3) of the directive. Similarly, the transfers envisaged in Article 12(2) of the directive are effected by hunters and sports target shooters, that is to say, a category of persons in possession of firearms who are deemed, on account of their respective activities, to have legitimate reasons that can be easily checked -- in particular by means of the pass which they are obliged to have with them -- for transferring firearms.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, the EU legislature, while taking account of the requirements of public safety, has laid down more flexible conditions so far as concerns transfers of firearms intended to be used for hunting and target shooting, since, as is apparent from the seventh recital of Directive 91/477, the harmonised framework established by that directive is liable to have an adverse effect on the exercise of the other fundamental freedoms by persons wishing to transfer their firearms for legitimate purposes.</p>

            <p>In that respect, the Court has explained that the pass has the purpose of facilitating the free movement of hunters and sports target shooters in possession of their weapons from one Member State to another, while pointing out that Article 1(4) of Directive 91/477, read in conjunction with Article 12(2) thereof, is intended mainly to facilitate the movement of weapons used for hunting or sporting purposes (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 September 2014, Zeman, C‑543/12, EU:C:2014:2143, paragraphs 39, 52 and 57).</p>

            <p>Consequently, although a simplified procedure for the transfer of firearms, such as that laid down in Article 12(2) of Directive 91/477, involving the pass, may have a positive effect on the freedom to provide services and the free movement of persons in the field of hunting and target shooting, the fact remains that that provision contributes to the main objective of that directive, which is not to facilitate those freedoms but to lay down a framework for the acquisition and possession of firearms for civilian use and their free movement within the European Union.</p>

            <p>The view cannot therefore be taken that Article 12(2) of Directive 91/477, read in conjunction with Article 1(4) thereof and Annex II thereto, is applicable to Gibraltar on the ground that that provision is not intended to facilitate the free movement of goods.</p>

            <p>As regards, in the second place, the question whether Article 12(2) of Directive 91/477, read in conjunction with Article 1(4) thereof and Annex II thereto, is applicable to Gibraltar on the ground that, although it concerns the free movement of goods, it relates neither to trade nor to commercial transactions concerning firearms, the referring court certainly agrees with the premiss that the exclusion of Gibraltar laid down in Article 29 of the 1972 Act of Accession, read in conjunction with point 4 of Section I of Annex I thereto, implies, in principle, that EU acts whose main aim is to ensure, as regards the free movement of goods, approximation of the provisions of the Member States do not apply on the territory of Gibraltar, in accordance with the case-law resulting from the judgment of 23 September 2003, Commission v United Kingdom ( C‑30/01, EU:C:2003:489).</p>

            <p>However, it has doubts as to the decision to be reached on the arguments of the claimants in the main proceedings that the general principle that exceptions are to be interpreted restrictively renders provisions such as Article 12(2) of Directive 91/477, read in conjunction with Article 1(4) thereof and Annex II thereto, applicable on that territory, on the ground that they do not concern the free movement of goods in a commercial context and, therefore, fall within a category of measures relating to the free movement of goods which does not adversely affect the interests, specified in paragraph 31 of the present judgment, which that exclusion is intended to protect.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it is common ground that Article 29 of the 1972 Act of Accession is an exception to the rule, laid down in Article 355(3) TFEU, that EU law is to apply to Gibraltar, an exception which, as the Court has pointed out in paragraphs 43 and 51 of the judgment of 21 July 2005, Commission v United Kingdom ( C‑349/03, EU:C:2005:488), must be interpreted restrictively, in the sense that its scope is limited to that which is strictly necessary to safeguard the interests which it allows Gibraltar to protect.</p>

            <p>Nevertheless, in the case which gave rise to that judgment the Court was not called upon to rule on the status of EU acts falling within the free movement of goods in the light of that exception, in contrast to the case which gave rise to the judgment of 23 September 2003, Commission v United Kingdom ( C-30/01, EU:C:2003:489).</p>

            <p>It follows that the need, recalled in paragraph 63 of the present judgment, to interpret Article 29 of the 1972 Act of Accession restrictively does not mean that EU provisions exist which, even though they contribute to the main objective of an act intended to ensure, as regards the free movement of goods, harmonisation of the provisions of the Member States, would be applicable on the territory of Gibraltar, as the claimants in the main proceedings seem to think.</p>

            <p>In that respect, it is to be noted that, under Article 28(1) TFEU, which is in Title II, relating to the free movement of goods, of Part Three of the FEU Treaty, the customs union is to cover all trade in goods. That union necessarily implies that the free movement of goods should be ensured between Member States and, in more general terms, within that union (judgment of 23 September 2003, Commission v United Kingdom, C‑30/01, EU:C:2003:489, paragraph 53).</p>

            <p>The Court has consistently held that `goods' for the purposes of that provision means goods which can be valued in money and which are capable, as such, of forming the subject of commercial transactions. However, the provisions of the FEU Treaty on the free movement of goods apply, in principle, irrespective of whether the goods concerned are being transported across borders for the purposes of sale or resale, or rather for personal use or consumption (see, to that effect, judgments of 7 March 1989, Schumacher, 215/87, EU:C:1989:111, paragraph 22, and of 3 December 2015, Pfotenhilfe-Ungarn, C-301/14, EU:C:2015:793, paragraph 47).</p>

            <p>Therefore, since secondary EU legislation has in principle the same field of application as the Treaties themselves (see, by analogy, judgment of 15 December 2015, Parliament and Commission v Council, C‑132/14 to C‑136/14, EU:C:2015:813, paragraph 77) and a strict interpretation of Gibraltar's exclusion from the common customs territory of the European Union cannot, if the uniform application of EU law is not to be undermined, result in an interpretation under which the free movement of goods would have a more limited scope in relations with Gibraltar than that which results from the provisions of the FEU Treaty, the provisions of Directive 91/477 relating to the transfer of firearms for civilian use must be regarded as falling within the free movement of goods, irrespective of whether the transfers are effected in a commercial context, including through dealers or in a mail order sale, or outside such a context, that is to say, by individuals, in particular by hunters and sports target shooters in order to be used in their respective activities.</p>

            <p>Moreover, contrary to what the claimants in the main proceedings suggest in their written observations, the applicability on the territory of Gibraltar of EU acts harmonising the Member States' provisions relating to the free movement of goods cannot depend on the reasons for transferring the goods concerned. If that were so, it would create -- as has been observed by the Gibraltar Government and the Commission at the hearing before the Court and by the Advocate General in point 73 of his Opinion -- a situation of legal uncertainty as to determination of the rules of EU law relating to the free movement of goods that are applicable on the territory of Gibraltar, and this would also be liable to affect adversely the interests which the regime that Gibraltar was granted by the 1972 Act of Accession is intended to protect.</p>
