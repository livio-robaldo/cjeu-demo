            <p>In support of their application for annulment, European Dynamics Luxembourg and Others relied on three pleas in law. By the first plea, they claimed that EUIPO had infringed the first subparagraph of Article 100(2) of the General Financial Regulation and Article 149 of Regulation No 2342/2002, as well as the obligation to state reasons within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 296 TFEU, by refusing to provide an adequate explanation or justification for the award decision. The second plea alleged `infringement of the tender specifications', in so far as EUIPO applied, to their detriment, a new award criterion and a new weighting of award sub-criteria not included in the tender specifications. In the third plea, European Dynamics Luxembourg and Others claimed that EUIPO had made a number of manifest errors of assessment.</p>

          <content eId="para_6220__content">
            <p>The General Court examined the second, third and first pleas in that order.</p>

          <content eId="para_6221__content">
            <p>First of all, in connection with the second plea, the General Court held, in paragraph 48 of the judgment under appeal, that EUIPO's negative comment on the bid submitted by European Dynamics Luxembourg that the bids obtaining a higher score than it obtained under the first award criterion `identified change management and communication as the two most essential tasks for the success of the project' showed that EUIPO had applied a weighting to the various sub-criteria within the first award criterion. In paragraph 53 of that judgment, the General Court found that, since such weighting was not provided for by the tender specifications or communicated in advance to the tenderers, EUIPO had breached, to the detriment of European Dynamics Luxembourg and Others, the principles of equal opportunity and transparency. Accordingly, in paragraph 55 of that judgment, the General Court upheld the second plea in part.</p>

          <num>12</num>
          <content eId="para_6222__content">
            <p>Next, in its examination of the third plea, the General Court considered that certain negative comments made by EUIPO concerning the assessment of the bid submitted by European Dynamics Luxembourg in respect of the first and second award criteria stemmed from a manifest error of assessment. First, it found, in paragraph 91 of the judgment under appeal, that, as the negative comment referred to in that paragraph was vitiated by a breach of the principles of equal opportunity and transparency, that conclusion itself also necessarily entailed a manifest error of assessment. Second, the General Court stated, in paragraph 102 of that judgment, that that negative comment, to the effect that European Dynamics Luxembourg had not provided any `examples of deliverables', also stemmed from a manifest error of assessment as there was no support for it in the tender specifications. As a consequence, it upheld the third plea as regards the complaints directed against those negative comments and dismissed the plea as to the remainder.</p>

          <content eId="para_6223__content">
            <p>Moreover, also in connection with the examination of the third plea, the General Court found, in paragraphs 86, 89 and 95 of the judgment under appeal, that various other comments made by EUIPO in relation to the evaluation of the bid submitted by European Dynamics Luxembourg concerning the first award criterion were vitiated by a failure to state reasons within the meaning of the second paragraph of Article 296 TFEU, read in conjunction with Article 100(2) of the Financial Regulation, so that the General Court was unable to verify whether manifest errors of assessment had been made in connection with those comments.</p>

          <content eId="para_6224__content">
            <p>Lastly, at the end of the examination of the first plea, after its reference in paragraph 134 of the judgment under appeal to the assessments for which it considered that insufficient reasons had been provided at the end of the examination of the third plea, the General Court held, in paragraph 135 of that judgment, that the contested decision contained several instances of failure to state reasons.</p>

          <content eId="para_6225__content">
            <p>In those circumstances, the General Court concluded, in paragraph 136 of the judgment under appeal, that it was necessary to annul the decision at issue in its entirety.</p>

          <content eId="para_6226__content">
            <p>In support of their claim for damages, European Dynamics Luxembourg and Others, as stated in paragraph 137 of the judgment under appeal, claimed compensation for the loss of opportunity to be awarded the contract in question as the successful tenderer ranked first and for the non-material damage suffered as a result of injury to their reputation and credibility.</p>

          <num>17</num>
          <content eId="para_6227__content">
            <p>The General Court found that the conditions were fulfilled for the European Union to incur non --contractual liability under the second paragraph of Article 340 TFEU, as the substantive unlawful conduct which it had established was likely to have affected the opportunity available to European Dynamics Luxembourg to have its bid ranked in first or second position in the cascade mechanism.</p>

            <p>However, the General Court did not consider it necessary to determine whether there was any harm to the reputation and credibility of European Dynamics Luxembourg and Others, on the ground that the annulment of the award decision was, in principle, sufficient to make good the damage caused by such harm. As a consequence, it upheld the claim for damages in part and invited the parties to reach an agreement as to the amount of compensation to be paid.</p>

            <p>EUIPO submits that the General Court erred in law by considering that the alleged introduction of new weighting factors in respect of the first award criterion led to a breach of the principles of equal opportunity and transparency. It argues that the General Court was incorrect to find that the decision at issue infringed those principles in that the evaluation of the bid submitted by European Dynamics Luxembourg was carried out, under the first award criterion, using factors for weighting sub-criteria within that award criterion which were not apparent from the tender specifications and were not disclosed to the tenderers. According to EUIPO, the assessment in paragraph 53 of the judgment under appeal, which establishes an `automatic causal link' between the introduction of those weighting factors and the breach of those principles, is based on a misinterpretation of the Court's case-law and, moreover, is not supported by sufficient reasoning. In particular, EUIPO refers in that regard to the judgment of 24 November 2005, ATI EAC and Viaggi di Maio and Others ( C‑331/04, EU:C:2005:718).</p>

It submits that it is apparent from the General Court's own case-law that it is for the applicant to demonstrate that a manifest error of assessment has had an effect on the final outcome of the tender procedure, which is a matter the General Court should therefore have considered. EUIPO argues that, while that case-law relates to failure to state reasons, it also applies to manifest errors of assessment.</p>

However, according to EUIPO, the General Court omitted to examine whether, but for those errors of assessment, that bid might have been ranked first or second in the cascade mechanism.

It is not necessary for the reasoning to go into all the relevant facts and points of law, since the question whether the statement of reasons for a measure meets the requirements of Article 296 TFEU must be assessed with regard not only to its wording but also to its context and to all the legal rules governing the matter in question (see, to that effect, judgment of 12 September 2017, Anagnostakis v Commission, C‑589/15 P, EU:C:2017:663, paragraph 29 and the case-law cited).</p>

As a consequence, it was held in paragraph 36 above that the judgment under appeal is vitiated by an error of law in that the General Court upheld the ninth complaint in the first part of the third plea in law at first instance, having found there had been a manifest error of assessment in relation to the first award criterion in question.</p>

            <p>At the end of the examination of that complaint, the General Court concluded, in paragraphs 85 and 86 of the judgment under appeal, that there was a failure to provide reasons on that point, for the purposes of the second paragraph of Article 296 TFEU, read in conjunction with Article 100(2) of the General Financial Regulation, in view of the lack of precision in the tender specifications and the brief and vague nature of the judgment of the evaluation committee, which made it impossible to verify whether the criticism advanced by EUIPO regarding the inclusion of a senior project manager and also a project manager in the tender submitted by European Dynamics Luxembourg was plausible.</p>

First, as is apparent from paragraphs 142 and 143 of the judgment under appeal, there is no causal link between the instances of failure to state reasons established by the General Court and the damage alleged. Secondly, since the General Court did not examine the impact of the manifest errors of assessment established in paragraphs 91 and 102 of that judgment on the final outcome of the tendering procedure, it failed to state adequate reasons for the finding in paragraph 144 of the judgment that there was a causal link between those errors and that damage.</p>

Whilst those grounds identify the damage suffered by European Dynamics Luxembourg as the loss of an opportunity to be ranked in first or second position under the cascade mechanism, the operative part orders the European Union to pay compensation for the harm suffered as a result of the loss of an opportunity to be awarded the framework contract as the contractor ranked first.</p>

            <p>In all circumstances, according to the Court's established case-law, it is the party seeking to establish the European Union's non-contractual liability which must adduce conclusive proof as to the existence and extent of the damage it alleges and as to the existence of a sufficiently direct causal nexus between the conduct of the institution concerned and the damage alleged (judgment of 30 May 2017, Safa Nicu Sepahan v Council, C‑45/15 P, EU:C:2017:402, paragraph 62 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In that regard, it is abundantly clear from a reading of the application lodged before the General Court that that application does not meet the requirements laid down by that case-law. European Dynamics Luxembourg and Others have claimed, inter alia, compensation for the estimated gross profit which European Dynamics Luxembourg could have obtained if it had been awarded the contract in question, while at the same time simply alleging that there was a `definitive' refusal to award it the contract in question. Nevertheless, European Dynamics Luxembourg and Others have failed to establish by evidence whether, and to what extent, in the circumstances of the case and in the absence of any errors on the part of EUIPO, European Dynamics Luxembourg would have been ranked first and awarded the contract in question. They have therefore failed to establish that it suffered actual harm and a causal link between the alleged unlawful conduct and the harm claimed.</p>

            <p>In any event, such a claim for damages cannot be based on EUIPO's unlawful conduct in connection with the evaluation of the second award criterion, found in paragraph 102 of the judgment under appeal. Even if European Dynamics Luxembourg's bid had been awarded all the points available in respect of the second award criterion, it would not have been ranked higher. Indeed, even if its bid had obtained the maximum score possible under the second award criterion, its final score would have been lower than the final scores of the bids ranked first and second.</p>
