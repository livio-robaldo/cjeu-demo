                <p>Trade in substances and mixtures is an issue relating not only to the internal market, but also to the global market. Enterprises should therefore benefit from the global harmonisation of rules for classification and labelling and from consistency between, on the one hand, the rules for classification and labelling for supply and use and, on the other hand, those for transport.</p>

                <p>With a view to facilitating worldwide trade while protecting human health and the environment, harmonised criteria for classification and labelling have been carefully developed over a period of 12 years within the United Nations (UN) structure, resulting in the Globally Harmonised System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals (hereinafter referred to as ``the GHS '').</p>
              </item>
              <item>
                <num>(6)</num>
                <p>This Regulation follows various declarations whereby the Community confirmed its intention to contribute to the global harmonisation of criteria for classification and labelling, not only at UN level, but also through the incorporation of the internationally agreed GHS criteria into Community law.</p>
              </item>
              <item>
                <num>(7)</num>
                <p>The benefits for enterprises will increase as more countries in the world adopt the GHS criteria in their legislation. The Community should be at the forefront of this process to encourage other countries to follow and with the aim of providing a competitive advantage to industry in the Community.</p>

                <p>Therefore it is essential to harmonise the provisions and criteria for the classification and labelling of substances, mixtures and certain specific articles within the Community, taking into account the classification criteria and labelling rules of the GHS, but also by building on the 40 years of experience obtained through implementation of existing Community chemicals legislation and maintaining the level of protection achieved through the system of harmonisation of classification and labelling, through Community hazard classes not yet part of the GHS as well as through current labelling and packaging rules.'</p>

            <p>Annex I to Regulation No 1272/2008, which sets out, inter alia, the criteria for classification in hazard classes and in their differentiations, consists of five parts. In Part 4 of that annex, point 4.1.3, entitled `Classification criteria for mixtures', is worded as follows: `4.1.3.1. The classification system for mixtures covers all classification categories which are used for substances, i.e. categories Acute 1 and Chronic 1 to 4. In order to make use of all available data for purposes of classifying the aquatic environmental hazards of the mixture, the following is applied where appropriate: The ``relevant components '' of a mixture are those which are classified ``Acute 1 '' or ``Chronic 1 '' and present in a concentration of 0.1% (w/w) or greater, and those which are classified ``Chronic 2 '', ``Chronic 3 '' or ``Chronic 4 '' and present in a concentration of 1% (w/w) or greater, unless there is a presumption (such as in the case of highly toxic components (see Section 4.1.3.5.5.5)) that a component present in a lower concentration can still be relevant for classifying the mixture for aquatic environmental hazards. Generally, for substances classified as ``Acute 1 '' or ``Chronic 1 '' the concentration to be taken into account is (0.1/</p>

The approach for classification of aquatic environmental hazards is tiered, and is dependent upon the type of information available for the mixture itself and for its components. Figure 4.1.2 outlines the process to be followed. Elements of the tiered approach include:</p>

            <p>Point 4.1.3.5.5 of Annex I to Regulation No 1272/2008, entitled `Summation method', provides: `4.1.3.5.5.1.1. In case of the substance classification categories Chronic 1 to Chronic 3, the underlying toxicity criteria differ by a factor of 10 in moving from one category to another. Substances with a classification in a high toxicity band therefore contribute to the classification of a mixture in a lower band. The calculation of these classification categories therefore needs to consider the contribution of any substance classified as Chronic 1, 2 or 3. 4.1.3.5.5.1.2. When a mixture contains components classified as Acute 1 or Chronic 1, attention must be paid to the fact that such components, when their acute toxicity is below 1 mg/l and/or chronic toxicity is below 0.1 mg/l (if non-rapidly degradable) and 0.01 mg/l (if rapidly degradable), contribute to the toxicity of the mixture even at a low concentration. Active ingredients in pesticides often possess such high aquatic toxicity but also some other substances like organometallic compounds. Under these circumstances the application of the normal generic concentration limits leads to an ``under-classification '' of the mixture. Therefore, multiplying factors shall be applied to account for highly toxic components, as described in Section 4.1.3.5.5.5.'</p>

            <p>In paragraph 30 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court held `that the Commission [had] committed a manifest error of assessment in that, by classifying CTPHT as an Aquatic Acute 1 (H400) and Aquatic Chronic 1 (H410) substance on the basis of its constituents, it [had] failed to comply with its obligation to take into consideration all the relevant factors and circumstances so as to take due account of the proportion in which the 16 [polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon] constituents are present in CTPHT and their chemical effects'.</p>

            <p>It is apparent from paragraphs 31 to 34 of that judgment that the General Court held that neither the Commission nor ECHA had been able to establish that `the Commission [had taken] into consideration the fact that, according to point 1.3 of the background document [annexed to the opinion of ECHA's Risk Assessment Committee], entitled ``Physiochemical properties '', the constituents of CTPHT were released from CTPHT only to a limited extent and that that substance was very stable'.</p>

            <p>That assessment is based on two factors. The first, set out in paragraph 33 of the judgment under appeal, relates to the fact that neither the opinion of ECHA's Risk Assessment Committee ( `the RAC's opinion') nor the background document annexed to that opinion shows that account was taken of the low water solubility of CTPHT. The second factor, set out in paragraph 34 of the judgment, is the finding that the classification of CTPHT was based on the presumption that 16 constituents representing 9.2% of CTPHT could dissolve in water, even though, according to the background document annexed to the RAC's opinion, the maximum rate of water solubility of the substance is 0.0014%.</p>

The first part of the second ground of appeal is based on the premiss that the General Court held that the Commission had erred in using the summation method.

            <p>The Commission submits that taking into account the solubility of CTPHT as a whole is not consistent with the summation method, which is based on the analysis of that substance's constituents. It claims that the assumption that the constituents of a substance dissolve in water is inherent in the summation method. Applying that method, it would therefore be presumed that the constituents are entirely soluble because their solubility would already be integrated at an earlier stage during the assessment of their toxicity. The fact that the 16 constituents taken into account in the present case represent only 9.2% of CTPHT is irrelevant, since it is not necessary, when using that method, to take into account either a large number of constituents or that the constituents taken into account represent a significant proportion of the substance. It is important only to ascertain, using the summation method, whether the thresholds set by Regulation No 1272/2008 are met, without the Commission having any margin of discretion whatsoever in that regard. The General Court therefore erred in law in criticising the Commission for not taking into consideration factors that are not prescribed by the summation method referred to in point 4.1.3.5.5 of Annex I to Regulation No 1272/2008.</p>

            <p>According to Bilbaína and others, since CTPHT has low water solubility, the General Court was right to question whether the summation method came to the correct conclusion. The argument that the Commission is straight-jacketed by a procedure which prohibits it from taking into account factual evidence that proves the opposite of a theoretical assumption which it insists on pursuing risks, in their view, leading to absurd, unjust and scientifically unfounded results.</p>

            <p>It should be observed in this regard, as the General Court held, in essence, in paragraph 23 of the judgment under appeal, that, if the Commission is to be able to classify a substance pursuant to Regulation No 1272/2008, account being taken of the complex scientific and technical assessments which it must undertake, it must be recognised as enjoying a broad discretion (judgments of 18 July 2007, Industrias Químicas del Vallés v Commission, C‑326/05 P, EU:C:2007:443, paragraph 75, and of 21 July 2011, Etimine, C‑15/10, EU:C:2011:504, paragraph 60).</p>

            <p>The exercise of that discretion is not, however, excluded from review by the Court. In particular, where a party claims that the institution competent in the matter has committed a manifest error of assessment, the EU judicature must verify whether that institution has examined, carefully and impartially, all the relevant facts of the individual case on which that assessment was based (see, inter alia, judgments of 21 November 1991, Technische Universität München, C‑269/90, EU:C:1991:438, paragraph 14; of 18 July 2007, Industrias Químicas del Vallés v Commission, C‑326/05 P, EU:C:2007:443, paragraph 77; of 6 November 2008, Netherlands v Commission, C‑405/07 P, EU:C:2008:613, paragraph 56; and of 22 December 2010, Gowan Comércio Internacional e Serviços, C‑77/09, EU:C:2010:803, paragraph 57). That duty to act diligently is inherent in the principle of sound administration and applies generally to the actions of the EU administration (judgment of 4 April 2017, European Ombudsman v Staelen, C‑337/15 P, EU:C:2017:256, paragraph 34; see also, to that effect, judgment of 29 March 2012, Commission v Estonia, C‑505/09 P, EU:C:2012:179, paragraph 95).</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is common ground that the classification of a UVCB substance in respect of the aquatic environmental hazards which it involves must be established in accordance with the provisions of Regulation No 1272/2008 governing the classification of mixtures. Point 4.1.3.2 of Annex I to that regulation states the following: `The approach for classification of aquatic environmental hazards is tiered, and is dependent upon the type of information available for the mixture itself and for its components. ... Elements of the tiered approach include:</p>

            <p>That point establishes a decreasing order of precedence between those three methods. When, as in the present case, the information available does not allow use of the first two methods, the classification of a UVCB substance must therefore be determined on the basis of the summation method, in accordance with the rules set out in point 4.1.3.5.5 of Annex I to Regulation No 1272/2008.</p>

As the Advocate General has observed in point 73 of his Opinion, the use of the expressions `where appropriate' and `all available data' tends to undermine the interpretation that taking into account information other than that expressly used in the course of the summation method should, in all circumstances, be excluded.</p>

That document therefore highlights `a complex interpretational problem, even for experts' presented by classification, in particular of so-called `complex or multi-component' substances for which `biodegradation, bioaccumulation, partitioning behaviour and water solubility all present problems of interpretation, where each component of the mixture may behave differently'.</p>

            <p>The Commission claims to have adopted the regulation at issue on the basis of a wide range of scientific evidence. This, it submits, is very complex evidence that justifies the application of the summation method. The General Court, in paragraph 34 of the judgment under appeal, took from that vast set of scientific and technical evidence only the sentence according to which 9.2% of CTPHT could dissolve in water in order to invalidate the Commission's assessment. However, according to the Commission, that factor is inherent in the summation method. By holding, in that paragraph 34, that the maximum solubility rate of CTPHT as a whole is 0.0014%, the General Court substituted its own assessment for that of the Commission. Furthermore, by doing so, the General Court distorted the evidence on the basis of which the regulation at issue had been adopted.</p>

            <p>However, it should be noted that this third ground of appeal is based on an erroneous reading of the judgment under appeal. The General Court did not, in paragraph 34 of the judgment under appeal, substitute its own assessment of the scientific and technical facts for that of the EU authorities. According to the settled case-law on the scope of judicial review, recalled in paragraph 35 above, the General Court's assessment, based on the data in the background document annexed to the RAC's opinion, focused exclusively on the procedural question of determining whether the Commission, in classifying CTPHT, complied with its obligation to take into consideration all the relevant factors and circumstances.</p>
