            <p>It follows from all the foregoing considerations that the answer to the first question referred is that, on a proper construction of Article 27(1) of the Dublin III Regulation, read in the light of the 19th recital of that regulation, an applicant for international protection is entitled, in an appeal against a decision to transfer him, to plead incorrect application of the criterion for determining responsibility relating to the irregular crossing of the border of a Member State, laid down in Article 13(1) of that regulation.</p>

              <p>Concerning the second and third questions</p>
            </tblock>
            <p>36 By its second and third questions, which may appropriately be examined together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether, on a proper construction of Article 13(1) of the Dublin III Regulation, read, where appropriate, in conjunction with the provisions of Regulation No 562/2006, as amended by Regulation No 610/2013, and those of Directive 2008/115, a third-country national whose entry has been tolerated by the authorities of a first Member State faced with an exceptionally large number of third-country nationals wishing to transit through that Member State in order to make an application for international protection in another Member State, without fulfilling the entry conditions in principle required in that first Member State, must be regarded as having `irregularly crossed' the border of that first Member State, within the meaning of that provision.</p>

          <content eId="para_14327__content">
            <p>As a preliminary point, it should be noted that it is apparent from paragraphs 41 to 58 of the judgment given today, Jafari(C‑646/16), that admitting a third-country national into the territory of a Member State in a situation such as that at issue in the case in the main proceedings cannot be treated as a `visa' situation, within the meaning of Article 12 of the Dublin III Regulation.</p>

          <content eId="para_14328__content">
            <p>As regards the interpretation of Article 13(1) of that regulation, it follows, first, from paragraphs 60 to 72 of that judgment that, while the measures adopted by the EU for the control of borders and of immigration are useful background for interpreting that provision, the fact remains that the full significance of the term `irregular crossing' of the border of a Member State, within the meaning of that regulation, cannot in principle be directly inferred from those measures.</p>

          <content eId="para_14329__content">
            <p>Next, it is clear from paragraphs 73 to 92 of that judgment that a third-country national admitted to the territory of a first Member State, without satisfying the entry conditions in principle required in that Member State, for the purpose of transit to another Member State in order to lodge an application for international protection there, must be regarded as having `irregularly crossed' the border of that first Member State, within the meaning of Article 13(1) of the Dublin III Regulation, whether that crossing has been tolerated or authorised in breach of the applicable rules or authorised on humanitarian grounds and by derogation from the entry conditions in principle imposed on third-country nationals.</p>

          <content eId="para_14330__content">
            <p>Lastly, the fact that the border crossing took place in a situation notable for the arrival of an exceptionally large number of third-country nationals wishing to obtain international protection can have no effect on the interpretation or application of that provision (judgment given today, Jafari, C‑646/16, paragraphs 93 to 100).</p>

            <p>However, it must be noted that, pursuant to Article 3(2) of the Dublin III Regulation and Article 4 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, an applicant for international protection must not be transferred to the Member State responsible if that transfer entails a real risk of the person concerned suffering inhuman or degrading treatment, within the meaning of that Article 4 (see, to that effect, judgment of 16 February 2017, C.K and Others, C‑578/16 PPU, EU:C:2017:127, paragraph 65). A transfer might, therefore, not be effected if, following the arrival of an exceptionally large number of third-country nationals wishing to obtain international protection, such a risk existed in the Member State responsible.</p>

          <content eId="para_14332__content">
            <p>It follows that the answer to the second and third questions is that, on a proper construction of Article 13(1) of the Dublin III Regulation, a third-country national whose entry has been tolerated by the authorities of a first Member State faced with the arrival of an exceptionally large number of third-country nationals wishing to transit through that Member State in order to lodge an application for international protection in another Member State, without satisfying the entry conditions in principle required in that first Member State, must be regarded as having `irregularly crossed' the border of that first Member State, within the meaning of that provision.</p>

            </tblock>
            <p>44 By its fifth question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether, on proper construction of Article 13(1) and Article 29(2) of the Dublin III Regulation, the periods laid down in those provisions continue to run after an appeal has been lodged against the transfer decision concerned, including when the court hearing that appeal has decided to seek a preliminary ruling from the Court.</p>

            <p>As regards, in the first place, the time limit laid down by Article 13(1) of the Dublin III Regulation, it must be noted that Article 7(2) of that regulation states that the Member State responsible is to be determined in accordance with the criteria set out in Chapter III of that regulation on the basis of the situation obtaining when the applicant first lodged his or her application for international protection with a Member State.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules: 1. On a proper construction of Article 27(1) of Regulation No 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 June 2013 establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person, read in the light of recital 19 of that regulation, an applicant for international protection is entitled, in an appeal against a decision to transfer him, to plead incorrect application of the criterion for determining responsibility relating to the irregular crossing of the border of a Member State, laid down in Article 13(1) of that regulation. 2. On a proper construction of Article 13(1) of Regulation No 604/2013, a third-country national whose entry has been tolerated by the authorities of a first Member State faced with the arrival of an exceptionally large number of third-country nationals wishing to transit through that Member State in order to lodge an application for international protection in another Member State, without satisfying the entry conditions in principle required in that first Member State, must be regarded as having `irregularly crossed' the border of that first Member State, within the meaning of that provision. 3. On a proper construction of Article 13(1), second sentence, of Regulation No 604/2013, read together with Article 7(2) of that regulation, the lodging of an appeal against a transfer decision has no effect on the running of the period laid down in Article 13(1). On a proper construction of Article 29(1) and (2) of that regulation, the lodging of such an appeal means that the period laid down by those provisions does not start to run until the final decision on that appeal, including when the court hearing the appeal has decided to request a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice, as long as that appeal had suspensory effect in accordance with Article 27(3) of that regulation.</p>
