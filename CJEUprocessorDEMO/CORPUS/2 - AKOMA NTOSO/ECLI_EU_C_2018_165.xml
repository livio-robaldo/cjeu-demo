            <p>In the early 2000s, Sernam SA's financial situation, whose activity was structurally loss-making, required the implementation of a restructuring plan, based inter alia on commercial assistance and recovery measures taken by SNCF, which was State aid. By Decision of 23 May 2001 concerning State aid NN 122/2000 (ex NJ 140/2000) ( OJ 2001 C 199, p. 15) ( `the Sernam 1 Decision'), the European Commission approved restructuring aid for the Sernam group and declared compatible with the internal market an aid amount of EUR 503 million for Sernam's restructuring, initially envisaged as part of a planned takeover of Sernam by Geodis SA.</p>

Moreover, by letter of 8 July 2002, the Commission received a complaint concerning the Sernam file.</p>

            <p>By Commission Decision 2006/367/EC of 20 October 2004 on the State aid partly implemented by France for the Sernam company ( OJ 2006 L 140, p. 1) ( `the Sernam 2 Decision'), the Commission found that the Sernam 1 Decision had not been complied with, which constituted misuse of aid within the meaning of Article 1(g) of Council Regulation (EC) No 659/1999 of 22 March 1999 laying down detailed rules for the application of Article [108 TFEU] ( OJ 1999 L 83, p. 1).</p>

            <p>As such, it found that EUR 41 million in amount of additional aid had been illegally paid out to cover certain losses subsequent to the Sernam 1 Decision and ordered its recovery. The Commission nevertheless also found that the French authorities had fulfilled a number of their objectives in accordance with the Sernam 1 Decision and that the aid under examination met the criteria for amending a restructuring plan provided for in point 3.2.4 of the Community Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty ( OJ 1999 C 288, p. 2). The Commission therefore confirmed that the aid approved by the Sernam 1 Decision in the amount of EUR 503 million was compatible with the internal market subject to two conditions, being, first, that Sernam refocus on its rail transport activities and, second, that it replace its road transport activities by using the services of independent undertakings. Alternatively, the Sernam 2 Decision also provided for the possibility of a transfer of Sernam's assets en bloc.</p>

            <p>The operative part of the Sernam 2 Decision is worded as follows: ` Article 1 1.   The State aid of EUR 503 million for ... Sernam ... approved in May 2001 is compatible with the common market under the conditions laid down in Articles 3 and 4. 2.   The State aid of EUR 41 million provided by France to ... Sernam ... is incompatible with the common market. Article 2 1.   [The French Republic] shall take all the measures necessary to recover from the beneficiary the aid referred to in Article 1(2) that has already been unlawfully placed at the beneficiary's disposal. 2.   Recovery shall take place immediately in accordance with the procedures of national law to the extent that these procedures permit the immediate and effective implementation of this Decision. The aid to be recovered shall include interest from the day on which the aid was placed at the beneficiary's disposal to the day on which the aid is recovered. Interest shall be calculated on the basis of the reference rate used for the calculation of the subsidy equivalent for aid granted for regional purposes. Article 3 1.   Subject to paragraph 2, the following conditions shall be complied with:</p>

Sernam's own road transport resources and services means all of the road resources -- i.e. road transport vehicles -- of the Sernam company of which it has full ownership or which it leases or rents. The companies that take over Sernam's road activities shall perform the road transport services using their own resources. 2.   In the event that Sernam sells its assets en bloc by 30 June 2005 at market price through a transparent and open procedure to a company that has no legal link with SNCF, the conditions of paragraph 1 shall not be applicable. Article 4 Any partial or full sale of Sernam shall be effected at market price and through a transparent procedure that is open to all its competitors. Under these conditions, ... Sernam ... shall, if it continues to exist, be responsible for paying back the aid of EUR 41 million.' Article 5 Within two months of the date on which this Decision is notified, [the French Republic] shall inform the Commission of the measures taken to comply with it.

            <p>SNCF decided to avail itself of the possibility provided for under Article 3(2) of the Sernam 2 Decision, which allowed for a transfer of Sernam's assets en bloc. According to the French authorities, Sernam's economic situation failed to elicit any proposals based on a positive valuation in the call for tenders conducted on SNCF's behalf by a bank. All the offers submitted under that procedure concluded that the value was very negative. As no firm offer had been submitted, the decision was taken to continue the discussions solely with the consortium established by candidate 5 who was associated with Sernam's management team. On 15 June 2005, candidate 5 ultimately informed SNCF orally that it was not in a position to submit a takeover offer -- not even a conditional one -- before 30 June 2005.</p>

            <p>The transfer process took place in four stages, as referred to in the memorandum of understanding signed on 21 July 2005 by SNCF, Sernam, Sernam Xpress SAS, one of 10 subsidiaries wholly owned by Sernam, and Financière Sernam. Firstly, SNCF recapitalised Sernam in the amount of EUR 57 million. Secondly, Sernam made a partial asset contribution to Sernam Xpress. That contribution covered all asset items, including the EUR 57 million recapitalisation, and Sernam's liabilities, except for certain financial liabilities representing an overall amount of EUR 38.5 million. In return, Sernam SA received a share in Sernam Xpress with a nominal value of EUR 100. Thirdly, immediately after the contribution was made, Sernam Xpress undertook a capital increase of EUR 2 million which was underwritten in full by SNCF. Following that operation, SNCF held the majority of the shares in Sernam Xpress. Fourthly, Sernam and SNCF assigned all of their shares in Sernam Xpress to Financière Sernam for EUR 2 million.</p>

            <p>Following that transfer, Sernam was put into compulsory liquidation on 15 December 2005. The debt of EUR 41 million, corresponding to the State aid to be repaid under the Sernam 2 Decision, was included in the liabilities of the liquidation account of Sernam. Of that amount, SNCF was actually able to recover EUR 2.75 million at the end of the winding-up proceedings.</p>

            <p>In the latter decision, the Commission found that the EUR 41 million of aid incompatible with the internal market had not been recovered. It further found that the transfer process had not complied with the conditions laid down in Article 3(2) of the Sernam 2 Decision and concluded that the EUR 503 million in restructuring aid, which had been conditionally authorised under the Sernam 2 Decision, had been misused. The Commission further found that the measures implemented by SNCF for the purposes of completing that transfer was new State aid incompatible with the internal market. That new aid comprised SNCF's EUR 57 million recapitalisation of Sernam, SNCF's waiving of EUR 38.5 million in debt for Sernam and the guarantees provided by SNCF when Sernam's activities were transferred to Financière Sernam, with the exception of the guarantee granted to the railwaymen.</p>

            <p>By the judgment under appeal, without ruling on the plea of inadmissibility raised by the Commission against the action at first instance, the General Court dismissed the action in its entirety, although it upheld SNCF's argument to the effect that the Commission had found, incorrectly that the transfer of Sernam's assets en bloc at a negative price did not constitute a sale. Thus, as is apparent from paragraphs 100 to 108 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court considered that the concept of `sale' did not necessarily preclude the transfer referred to from being effected at a negative price.</p>

            <p>First of all, such a conclusion is based on an error of law. The sale of assets en bloc provided for in Article 3(2) of the Sernam 2 Decision implies that all of the undertaking's assets are transferred together at the same time to a single purchaser. Thus, the inevitable consequence of the concept of transfer of assets en bloc is the continuation of the undertaking's activities.</p>

The objective pursued, as evidenced by Article 3(2) of that decision, read in the light of recital 217 thereof, is therefore to sever for the future all capital links between SNCF and its subsidiary in order to avoid the grant of new State aid.</p>

The applicant further criticises the General Court for having referred, in paragraph 218 of the judgment under appeal, to a purchaser integrating Sernam's assets into its own business strategy, whereas that condition is not to be found in the wording of recital 217 of the Sernam 2 Decision, which refers only to an independent acquiring party, that is to say, one not having a legal link to SNCF.

In paragraphs 86 and 87 of the judgment under appeal, it recalled, in support of its method, that according to the Court of Justice's settled case-law, in interpreting a provision of EU law it is necessary to consider not only its wording but also the context in which it occurs and the objects of the rules of which it is part (see, inter alia, judgment of 27 September 2017, Nintendo, C‑24/16 and C‑25/16, EU:C:2017:724, paragraph 70 and the case-law cited) and, moreover, the operative part of a Union act is indissociably linked to the statement of reasons for it, so that, when it has to be interpreted, account must be taken of the reasons which led to its adoption (judgment of 25 October 2011, eDate Advertising and Others, C‑509/09 and C‑161/10, EU:C:2011:685, paragraph 55 and the case-law cited).</p>

Yet neither Article 3(2) nor recital 217 of the Sernam 2 Decision refers to such an actual transfer. Under French law, moreover, in particular Article 1583 of the French Civil Code, a sale results from the agreement between the purchaser and the vendor, once they have agreed on the object and price, even if that object has not yet been delivered or the price paid. Thus, in having attributed to the term `sale' a meaning which, in going beyond the unambiguous wording used by the Commission, is not apparent from either the operative part or the reasons of the Sernam 2 Decision and comes up against the meaning attached to that term in the national legal orders, the General Court distorted the concept of `sale', thereby erring in law.</p>

            <p>Thus, the General Court was correct in holding in paragraph 117 of the judgment under appeal that the Sernam 2 Decision established a clear contrast between the sale of Sernam in its entirety, including assets and liabilities, and the sale of its assets en bloc, and in inferring therefrom, in paragraphs 118 and 124 of that judgment, that the transfer of Sernam's assets en bloc referred to in Article 3(2) of the Sernam 2 Decision, read in the light of recital 217 thereof, had to be construed as excluding the liabilities.</p>

            <p>By the second ground of appeal, the applicant criticises the General Court for having made an error of law in holding, in paragraphs 163 and 164 of the judgment under appeal, that the transfer of Sernam's assets en bloc had not resulted from an open and transparent tendering procedure, as required by Article 3(2) of the Sernam 2 Decision, on the ground that it was the consortium made up of candidate 5 and Sernam's management team who had initially participated in the tendering procedure, and not its members individually, and that accordingly the management team had not participated autonomously in the procedure from the beginning. Neither the Sernam 2 Decision nor EU law requires the ultimately successful candidate following a tendering procedure to have participated autonomously in the procedure from the beginning.</p>

            <p>The applicant observes that candidate 5 and Sernam's management team had, within a consortium, been associated with the tendering procedure from the start of that procedure and had proposed the least negative value for the assets en bloc. It was only after candidate 5 withdrew that Sernam's management team decided to pursue the process and submit on their own the takeover offer initially put forward by the consortium. The applicant thus takes the view that such circumstances meet the requirements of an open and transparent tendering procedure as reflected in the Commission's decision-making practice and the Court's case-law.</p>

Moreover, in the judgments of 29 April 2004, Germany v Commission ( C‑277/00, EU:C:2004:238, paragraph 95), and of 19 October 2005, CDA Datenträger Albrechts v Commission ( T‑324/00, EU:T:2005:364, paragraph 73), it was held that the fact that a sale has not taken place immediately, but has been preceded by unsuccessful attempts with another company, was an indicator that the procedure was not sufficiently open and transparent.</p>

            <p>The applicant further considers that it is possible to accept that the principles of openness and transparency in public procurement may be applicable by analogy to procedures involving transfers of assets.

Those principles should a fortiori be deemed to have been observed where the assets have been transferred to the last interested party, the only one to have made a firm offer, when it has participated in the process in its entirety, initially as part of a consortium from which the other party withdrew in the course of the procedure.</p>

            <p>First of all, without it being necessary to rule on a potential analogy between the tendering procedure relevant to the present case and the principles that are applicable in public procurement, set out in paragraph 64 of the present judgment, it should be noted that the applicant's argument concerning that potential analogy is based on the fact that, at the end of the tendering procedure, no bid or no appropriate bid had been submitted. That kind of argument can be successful only if it challenges the General Court's findings of fact in paragraph 170 of the judgment under appeal, to the effect that `[t]he ``last interested person '' in the transparent and open tendering procedure in this case was candidate 4. ... As observed by the Commission in its written pleadings, following candidate 5's withdrawal, recourse should have been had to candidate 4, who had been part of the process since the beginning and had also indicated its interest at the end of the second round'. That argument, which asks the Court of Justice to substitute its analysis for the one carried out by the General Court as part of its sovereign assessment of the facts and evidence, is therefore inadmissible and must be rejected.</p>

The offer put forward by Sernam's management team on 30 June 2005, which referred to EUR 59 million in recapitalisation, took account of the sharp deterioration in Sernam's cash situation between 31 December 2004 and 30 June 2005.</p>

In the applicant's submission, since the sale of the assets en bloc entails the continuation of Sernam's activity, the structurally loss-making nature of the activity transferred and the automatic transfer of the employment contracts, as provided for under French law, necessarily entail a negative valuation of the activity. Thus, the negative price results not from the addition of certain liabilities, but from the transfer of a structurally loss-making entity.</p>

The inference it drew therefrom in paragraphs 154 and 158 of the judgment under appeal, having found that the negative price paid for Sernam's assets would have been positive or nil if only the assets had been sold, is a factual assessment.

Thus, the reference to existence of `Sernam' should be understood as referring to the existence of the legal person consisting of Sernam.

            <p>In the second place, on the basis of paragraph 135 of the judgment of 13 September 2010, Greece and Others v Commission ( T‑415/05, T‑416/05 and T‑423/05, EU:T:2010:386), and paragraph 155 of the judgment of 28 March 2012, Ryanair v Commission ( T‑123/09, EU:T:2012:164), the applicant observes that the determination of whether there is economic continuity between a company that has benefited from State aid and the party acquiring its assets, thereby entailing a transfer of the competitive advantage associated with the benefit of that aid to the party acquiring those assets, takes the following elements into consideration: the subject matter of the transfer, the transfer price, the identity of the shareholders or owners of the acquiring undertaking and of the original undertaking, the moment at which the transfer was carried out and, lastly, the economic logic of the transaction. The use of those criteria by the General Court in its determination of whether there was economic continuity between Sernam and the party acquiring its assets is vitiated by a number of errors of law.</p>

            <p>First of all, as regards the identity of the shareholders, the General Court held, incorrectly, in paragraph 242 of the judgment under appeal that it was a question of assessing the economic continuity between Sernam and Sernam Xpress. Since French law does not allow, inter alia, a negative price to be stipulated in a contract of sale, the conditions laid down in Article 3(2) of the Sernam 2 Decision made it impossible to sell Sernam's assets en bloc directly to Financière Sernam. The method chosen, a type of contribution-transfer preceded by a recapitalisation, ensured that the economic reality of the operation remained a transfer of Sernam's assets en bloc to Financière Sernam in a manner permitted by national law.</p>

The General Court also made a contradictory statement of reasons in the light of the principle, referred to in paragraph 107 of the judgment under appeal, to the effect that a sale may be effected at a negative price.</p>

In the present case, no circumvention may be alleged, since the Commission itself provided for the possibility of a transfer of assets en bloc and those assets were sold at market price.</p>

Restoring the situation prior to the payment of aid which was unlawful or incompatible with the internal market is a necessary requirement for preserving the effectiveness of the provisions of the Treaties concerning State aid (judgment of 20 September 2001, Banks, C‑390/98, EU:C:2001:456, paragraph 75).</p>

            <p>As observed by the General Court in paragraph 277 of the judgment under appeal, the illegal aid must be recovered from the company which carries on the economic activity of the undertaking which initially benefited from the advantage associated with the grant of State aid and which, therefore, retains the actual benefit thereof (see, to that effect, judgment of 24 January 2013, Commission v Spain, C‑529/09, EU:C:2013:31, paragraph 109 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>As regards, in the second place, alleged errors of law in the analysis of the economic continuity, it must be remembered that such continuity between companies who are parties to a transfer of assets is assessed in the light of the subject matter of the transfer (assets and liabilities, maintenance of the workforce, bundled assets), the transfer price, the identity of the shareholders or owners of the acquiring undertaking and the original undertaking, the moment when the transfer takes place (after the commencement of the investigation, opening of the procedure or the final decision) and also the economic logic of the operation (see, inter alia, judgment of 8 May 2003, Italy and SIM 2 Multimedia v Commission, C‑328/99 and C‑399/00, EU:C:2003:252, paragraph 78).</p>

            <p>Firstly, as regards the subject matter of the transfer, in paragraph 240 of the judgment under appeal the General Court merely referred to the findings in paragraphs 134 to 137 of that judgment, the subject matter of the transaction was not solely a sale of Sernam's assets, but rather the transfer of it in its entirety, including its assets and liabilities. It is clear that the applicant is not challenging those findings in the present appeal.</p>

            <p>Secondly, as is apparent from the analysis in paragraphs 66 to 69 of the present judgment, the General Court was justified in finding that the offer from Sernam's management team was not the result of an open and transparent tendering procedure. It was thus correct in holding, in paragraph 255 of the judgment under appeal, that for that reason the negative price paid in the present case was not a market price.</p>

            <p>In substantiating that determination, moreover, the General Court looked to other factors, which the applicant has not disputed, inter alia by observing, in paragraphs 256 and 260 of the judgment under appeal, that the alleged market price had been perceived as operating aid and that the expert reports provided did not show that the transfer price was a market price. Consequently, the applicant cannot criticise the General Court for having refused to take the market price criterion into consideration.</p>

            <p>Thirdly, as regards the error of law alleged by the applicant regarding the application of the criterion of the identity of the shareholders, although the greatest weight should be given to the economic reality of the State aid, the legal form it takes may also turn out to be relevant for assessing that economic reality. In particular, the question of the transfer of the aid is assessed differently, depending on whether it forms part of a sale of shares or of a sale of all or part of the assets (see, to that effect, judgment of 29 April 2004, Germany v Commission, C‑277/00, EU:C:2004:238, paragraphs 78 and 84).</p>

          <content eId="para_7742__content">
            <p>The General Court was accordingly correct, in paragraph 242 of the judgment under appeal, in agreeing with the Commission when it took into account the links between Sernam and Sernam Xpress before going on to find that Sernam Xpress was the debtor of the obligation to repay the illegal aid, an obligation ultimately passed on to Financière Sernam by reason of its merger with Sernam Xpress.</p>

            <p>Moreover, for the same reasons as set out in paragraphs 85 and 86 of the present judgment, the applicant cannot argue that, in its analysis of the criterion relating to the identity of the shareholders, the General Court contradicted its own finding in paragraph 107 of the judgment under appeal about the general possibility of selling at negative prices.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, regarding the time of transfer, it is clear that, in paragraph 246 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court merely noted that `[t]he moment of implementation of a decision involving the possibility of a sale of assets en bloc of the aid recipient, and also the obligation to recover unlawful and incompatible aid, seems at least as opportune for circumventing the recovery obligation as the phase involving the formal investigation procedure', which is not an error of law.</p>

            <p>It is appropriate, at the outset, to dismiss the argument by which the applicant criticises the General Court for having failed to sanction the contradictory statement of reasons on which the Sernam 3 Decision was based. Such a line of argument, which was put forward by the applicant only at the reply stage, was not raised before the General Court. The General Court cannot be criticised for having failed to examine an argument that was not put forward to it.</p>

            <p>As regards the applicant's argument alleging a failure to provide an answer, it is worth noting that, in paragraphs 286 and 287 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court summarised the reasons put forward by the Commission for not applying the private investor test. As the General Court observed, the Commission bases itself on two grounds in recitals 154 and 155 of the Sernam 3 Decision, being, in the first place, the ground that that criterion is not applicable in an aid recovery situation and, in the second place, the ground that the sale of Sernam's assets en bloc allowed under Article 3(2) of the Sernam 2 Decision forms part of a compensation situation that precludes the principle of the informed private investor from being taken into account.</p>

          <content eId="para_7754__content">
            <p>In paragraphs 288 to 311 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court examined the applicability of the private investor test to the compensatory measures and concluded that that criterion could not be applied, having observed, in paragraph 309 of that judgment, that `the compensatory logic of the sale of Sernam's assets en bloc, referred to in recital 155 of the [Sernam 3] decision, differed from the logic of a private operator seeking to maximise its profits or, as in this case, minimise its losses'.</p>

Consequently, the General Court could, without vitiating the reasons of the judgment under appeal by a failure to answer, conclude in paragraph 312 of that judgment that it was no longer necessary to examine such an argument.</p>

            <p>By the second part of the sixth ground of appeal, the applicant submits that, in upholding the approach taken by the Commission in recital 155 of the Sernam 3 Decision, by which it found that since the sale of Sernam's assets en bloc was a compensatory measure, the principle of the informed private investor was inapplicable, the General Court distorted the Sernam 2 Decision. The applicant puts forward four arguments in support of that second part.</p>

          <content eId="para_7758__content">
            <p>Firstly, the General Court distorted the clear wording of Article 3(2) of the Sernam 2 Decision. The obligation referred to therein to effect a transfer of Sernam's assets en bloc at market price and following a transparent and open tendering procedure corresponds precisely to the application of the informed private investor test. That conclusion is also apparent from the Commission Notice on the notion of State aid as referred to in Article 107(1) [TFEU] ( OJ 2016 C 262, p. 1). In not applying the informed private investor test to the transfer of Sernam's assets en bloc, the General Court distorted the facts of the dispute and the content of the Sernam 2 Decision by substituting its own statement of reasons for those contained in that decision.</p>

          <content eId="para_7759__content">
            <p>Secondly, the General Court distorted the Sernam 2 Decision in finding, in paragraph 301 of the judgment under appeal, that `[s]ince the condition relating to the sale of the assets en bloc excluded the liabilities, the possibility of obtaining a negative price in the present case was by definition precluded'. As the applicant also argued in support of the third part of the first ground of appeal and as set out in paragraphs 47 to 52 of the present judgment, in finding that the transfer of Sernam's assets en bloc had to exclude all liabilities, the General Court distorted Article 3(2) of the Sernam 2 Decision, just as it did by adding a condition not imposed by the Sernam 2 Decision in having found that the price for transferring Sernam's assets en bloc could not be negative. The terms of Article 3(2) of the Sernam 2 Decision refer only to a requirement of market price which, according to the case-law, may be negative, as is apparent from the judgments of 28 January 2003, Germany v Commission ( C‑334/99, EU:C:2003:55, paragraph 133), and of 13 May 2015, Niki Luftfahrt v Commission ( T‑511/09, EU:T:2015:284, paragraph 139).</p>

            <p>Thirdly, the applicant criticises the General Court for having given a contradictory statement of reasons in finding, in paragraph 301 of the judgment under appeal, that `the possibility of obtaining a negative price in the present case was by definition precluded'. Such a finding runs counter to the statement in paragraph 100 of that judgment, to the effect that, under Article 3(2) of the Sernam 2 Decision, `the only price-related requirement was that it be a market price'.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, the applicant takes the view that the positive or negative value of the market price had no bearing on the achievement of the purpose pursued as stated in Article 3(2) of the Sernam 2 Decision. Under recital 217 of that decision, that purpose consists of Sernam ceding its market shares to an independent acquiring party and no longer operating in its previous legal form, without a positive price being necessary. In the applicant's submission, those kinds of objectives were attained at the time of the transfer of Sernam's assets at a market price, albeit negative, following a transparent and open tendering procedure. Consequently, the General Court also distorted the Sernam 2 Decision in having found that the transfer of Sernam's assets en bloc at a negative price was, by definition, precluded.</p>

            <p>It is, moreover, apparent from paragraph 80 of the Communication from the Commission -- Guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring non-financial undertakings in difficulty ( OJ 2014 C 249, p. 1) that compensatory measures to limit distortions of competition `should therefore normally take the form of divestments on a going concern basis of viable stand-alone businesses that, if operated by a suitable purchaser, can compete effectively in the long term'. The purpose of Article 3(2) of the Sernam 2 Decision echoes that logic perfectly by ensuring that Sernam's market shares are ceded to the party acquiring its assets and allowing that party to compete effectively in the long term. In that regard, the value of the market price is of no import.</p>

            <p>As rightly observed by the General Court in paragraph 292 of the judgment under appeal, the applicability of the private investor test ultimately depends on the Member State concerned having conferred, in its capacity as shareholder and not in its capacity as public authority, an economic advantage on an undertaking belonging to it (see, inter alia, judgments of 5 June 2012, Commission v EDF, C‑124/10 P, EU:C:2012:318, paragraph 81, and of 3 April 2014, Commission v Netherlands and ING Groep, C‑224/12 P, EU:C:2014:213, paragraph 31).</p>

            <p>As the intervention of the public entity in its capacity as shareholder has been established, and therefore the applicability of the private investor as well, the private investor test is applied, next, in order to determine whether, because of its effects, the economic advantage granted, in whatever form, through State resources to a public undertaking distorts or threatens to distort competition and affects trade between Member States (judgment of 5 June 2012, Commission v EDF, C‑124/10 P, EU:C:2012:318, paragraph 89).</p>

            <p>As regards the application of the private investor test, according to the Court's settled case-law, the market price is the highest price which a private investor acting under normal competitive conditions is ready to pay for a company in the situation it is in and, where a public authority proceeds to sell an undertaking belonging to it by way of an open, transparent and unconditional tender procedure, it can be presumed that the market price corresponds to the highest offer (see, inter alia, judgments of 24 October 2013, Land Burgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C‑223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraphs 92 and 94, and of 16 July 2015, BVVG, C‑39/14, EU:C:2015:470, paragraph 32).</p>

            <p>However, and contrary to the applicant's assertions, the applicability of the informed private investor test cannot be inferred from a condition that usually forms part of its application. Therefore, a transfer at market price and through an open and transparent tendering procedure does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that that test has been applied.</p>

            <p>Secondly, inasmuch as the applicant disputes the General Court's conclusion in paragraph 301 of the judgment under appeal regarding the sale price of Sernam's assets en bloc, it should be observed that it was in the light of the obligation to exclude the liabilities from that transfer that the General Court found that the possibility of obtaining a negative price was by definition excluded. Moreover, as is apparent from paragraphs 54 to 58 of the present judgment, that court was correct in finding that Article 3(2) of the Sernam 2 Decision had to be construed as requiring such an exclusion of the liabilities. Consequently, it cannot be argued that, in so doing, the General Court added a condition not provided for by the Sernam 2 Decision.</p>

          <content eId="para_7773__content">
            <p>Thirdly, inasmuch as the applicant alleges that the General Court gave a contradictory statement of reasons in the judgment under appeal, it should be observed that it is putting forward a line of argument similar to that put forward under the fourth ground of appeal and summarised in paragraph 79 of the present judgment. It should be borne in mind in that regard that, as held in paragraph 85 of the present judgment, the statement in paragraph 100 of the judgment under appeal to the effect that, on the basis of a literal interpretation of Article 3(2) of the Sernam 2 Decision, the only price-related requirement was that it be a market price through a transparent and open procedure, relates to the analysis of the concept of `sale' by which the General Court considered, in examining the second part of the fourth plea in law put forward at first instance, that a sale may, in principle, be completed at a negative price.</p>

          <content eId="para_7774__content">
            <p>That consideration therefore concerns a different question from the one examined by the General Court in paragraph 301 of the judgment under appeal, which was whether in the present case a sale at a negative price was possible in relation to the sale en bloc of Sernam's assets. For those reasons, the argument alleging a contradictory statement of reasons is unfounded.</p>

            <p>Fourthly, inasmuch as the applicant argues that the positive or negative transfer price has no bearing on the purpose pursued by Article 3(2) of the Sernam 2 Decision, it should be observed that, as the valuation of that price is contingent on the inclusion or exclusion of the liabilities in the transfer, that argument is being conflated with the argument put forward under the third part of the first ground of appeal, according to which adding liabilities to the sale of Sernam's assets en bloc has no bearing on that purpose. That argument must therefore be rejected on the same grounds as those stated in paragraphs 54 to 58 of the present judgment.</p>

In the light of the circumstances of the present case, any solution other than the one actually implemented, including compulsory liquidation, would have been more costly. In refusing to compare the applicant's conduct with the economic rationality a private investor would have employed in the same circumstances and in finding, in paragraph 309 of the judgment under appeal, that the compensatory logic of the sale of Sernam's assets en bloc was different from the logic of a private economic operator seeking to maximise its profits or, as in the present case, minimise its losses, the General Court infringed Article 107(1) TFEU.</p>

            <p>Inasmuch as the applicant criticises the General Court for having ruled out the application of the private investor test, first of all, it should be borne in mind that, consistently with the case-law referred to in paragraph 138 of the present judgment, the applicability of that test depends on the Member State concerned acting in its capacity as shareholder and not in its capacity as a public authority. In that regard, it is for the Commission to make an overall assessment taking into account, in addition to the evidence provided by the Member State concerned, all other relevant evidence enabling it to determine whether the Member State took the measure in question in its capacity as shareholder or as a public authority (see, to that effect, judgments of 5 June 2012, Commission v EDF, C‑124/10 P, EU:C:2012:318, paragraph 86; of 24 October 2013, LandBurgenland and Others v Commission, C‑214/12 P, C‑215/12 P and C‑223/12 P, EU:C:2013:682, paragraph 60; and of 1 October 2015, Electrabel and Dunamenti Erőmű v Commission, C‑357/14 P, EU:C:2015:642, paragraph 102).</p>

            <p>Next, it should be observed that, for the purpose of determining whether there is State aid, the private investor test can be used to determine whether the measures adopted by the Member State concerned satisfied an economic rationality test, so that a private investor might also accept them (see, inter alia, judgment of 3 April 2014, Commission v Netherlands and ING Groep, C‑224/12 P, EU:C:2014:213, paragraphs 36). Thus, under that test, the conditions which a measure must meet in order to be treated as `aid' for the purposes of Article 107 TFEU are not met if the recipient public undertaking could, in circumstances which correspond to normal market conditions, obtain the same advantage as that which has been made available to it through State resources (see, inter alia, judgment of 4 September 2014, SNCM and France v Corsica Ferries France, C‑533/12 P and C‑536/12 P, EU:C:2014:2142, paragraph 30 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>As is apparent from paragraphs 30 to 32 of the present judgment and as observed by the General Court in paragraphs 305 and 306 of the judgment under appeal, the transfer of Sernam's assets en bloc, referred to in Article 3(2) of the Sernam 2 Decision, was a compensatory measure intended to prevent distortions of competition. Therefore, the General Court was correct in holding in paragraphs 307 and 308 of the judgment under appeal that the measures provided for in Article 3(2) of the Sernam 2 Decision did not correspond to normal market conditions and that accordingly, as it observed in paragraph 309 of that judgment, `the compensatory logic of the sale of Sernam's assets en bloc ... differed from the logic of a private operator seeking to maximise its profits or, as in this case, minimise its losses', before going on to infer therefrom, in paragraph 311 of that judgment, that the Commission could not be criticised for having ruled out, on the same grounds, the private investor test in recital 155 of the Sernam 3 Decision.</p>

            <p>Although that test does not disregard the obligations by which economic operators are bound (see, to that effect, judgment of 4 September 2014, SNCM and France v Corsica Ferries France, C‑533/12 P and C‑536/12 P, EU:C:2014:2142, paragraph 33 and the case-law cited), the obligations which are normal market conditions must not be confused with those aimed at preventing distortions of competition in that market.</p>

            <p>Although, as the applicant argues, the implementation of the Sernam 2 Decision entailed that it must conduct itself in an economically rational manner, that did not necessarily mean that that implementation amounted to an infringement of Article 3(2) of that decision, as held by the General Court in paragraph 310 of the judgment under appeal. Moreover, inasmuch as the applicant argues that a private undertaking having to apply the Sernam 2 Decision would, by way of economic rationality, opt for the same conditions for the transfer of assets en bloc as those chosen in the present case, its line of argument is based on the incorrect premise that the method of transfer is compatible with the purpose and obligations imposed under Article 3(2) of the Sernam 2 Decision.</p>

            <p>Moreover, as acknowledged by the applicant, the measures considered by the Commission as new State aid are not severable from the application of Article 3(2) of the Sernam 2 Decision. Therefore, those measures cannot be examined independently of the compensatory purpose of that provision, and the General Court was therefore correct in not applying the informed private investor test to those new advantages in paragraphs 323 and 327 of the judgment under appeal.</p>
