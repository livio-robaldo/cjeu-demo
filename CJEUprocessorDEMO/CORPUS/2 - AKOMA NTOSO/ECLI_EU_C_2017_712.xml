            <p>SMS group is an undertaking established in Germany that sells and erects steel processing systems. On 7 February 2008 SMS Meer, an entity that has since been absorbed by SMS group, concluded, as seller, contract `No 27' with Zimekon Handels GmbH, Austria ( `the purchaser') for the construction and supply of a pipe-welding system for the manufacture of steel piping and pipe profiles by means of longitudinal electric welding ( `the RSA'). The consignee of the RSA was OOO Zimekon, Ukraine.</p>

            <p>By virtue of the payment plan set out in contract No 27, the purchaser had to pay, for the first phase of the manufacture of the RSA, an advance of EUR 2000000 in March 2008, then EUR 800000 by 15 April 2008, a further EUR 1000000 by 15 May 2008, and, ultimately, EUR 1000000 by 15 June 2008.

            <p>On 26 June 2008, although the purchaser had paid only the advance of EUR 2000000, SMS Meer concluded a subcontracting agreement with Asmas AES, established in Turkey, the subject matter of which was the supply of equipment needed by SMS Meer to manufacture the RSA ( `the goods at issue'). On 5 November 2008, at the purchaser's request, the performance of contract No 27 was nonetheless suspended until 1 September 2009, as the purchaser had found itself in financial difficulties. SMS Meer requested the purchaser to make the outstanding payments, specifying that work would only resume after the amounts due had been paid.</p>

            <p>On 23 December 2009, SMS Meer applied to the tax authority for a refund of the VAT paid to the Romanian State upon importation of the goods at issue. In response to a request for additional information by the tax authority, SMS Meer explained that, in the event of non-performance of contract No 27, it intended to export those goods. It did not however provide any specific information as to the destination or the date on which the exportation was to take place.</p>

            <p>The tax authority nonetheless refused to refund the VAT, considering that SMS Meer had not provided any supporting documents demonstrating the subsequent movements of the goods at issue and their final recipient. After the administrative appeal filed by SMS Meer against the refusal to refund was dismissed by the complaints department of the tax authority, the Curtea de Apel Bucureşti (Bucharest Court of Appeal, Romania), by a first judgment of 30 May 2012, dismissed SMS Meer's action for annulment of those two tax authority decisions.</p>

By judgment of 9 July 2014, that court again dismissed SMS Meer's claim as unfounded, since, according to that court, the tax authority had been right to require SMS Meer to demonstrate the subsequent movement of the goods at issue. SMS Meer was required, under Article 147 2(1)(a) of Law No 571/2003, to provide proof of the destination of the goods imported into Romania, their actual destination being relevant for the tax regime applicable.</p>

            <p>SMS Meer appealed against the judgment of 9 July 2014 on a point of law, maintaining that the conclusion of contract No 27 with the purchaser and its partial performance constituted a taxable transaction. Moreover, contract No 27 had been performed as the result of the payment of an advance of EUR 2000000 on the total price agreed, the conclusion of a subcontracting agreement and the purchase from a Turkish supplier of some of the components necessary to manufacture the RSA. SMS Meer had therefore established a direct link between the importation of the goods at issue and its taxable transactions. The VAT refund cannot depend, according to SMS Meer, on the proof of circulation of those goods following importation, given that contract No 27 had not in the end been completed. At the time the goods were imported, the parties still wished to carry out the transaction.</p>

            <p>According to the referring court, at the time of the importation, there was a serious risk for SMS Meer that contract No 27 would be terminated, in so far as the purchaser had failed to respect the payment schedule under that contract. In those circumstances, the question was whether the fact that the importation of those goods had been carried out when the performance of the contract was suspended meant that the importation of the goods at issue was no longer linked to that performance.</p>

            <p>By its three questions, which should be examined together, the referring court asks, in essence, whether the Eighth Directive, read in conjunction with Article 170 of the VAT Directive, must be interpreted as precluding a refusal by a Member State to refund the VAT paid on the importation of goods to a taxable person who is not established on its territory in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings where, at the time of importation, the performance of the contract in connection with which the taxable person purchased and imported those goods was suspended, the transaction for which they were intended to be used was in the end not carried out, and the taxable person did not provide proof of their subsequent movements.</p>

            <p>In order to answer this question, it should be borne in mind, first of all, that the aim of the Eighth Directive is to establish detailed rules for the refund of VAT paid in a Member State by taxable persons established in another Member State and thus to harmonise the right to refund arising from Article 170 of the VAT Directive (judgment of 28 June 2007, Planzer Luxembourg, C‑73/06, EU:C:2007:397, paragraph 34 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>In that context, it follows from Article 2 of the Eighth Directive that each Member State is to refund to any taxable person who is not established in the territory of the country but who is established in another Member State, subject to the conditions laid down in that directive, any VAT charged in respect of, inter alia, the importation of goods into the first Member State, in so far as those goods are used for the purposes of the transactions referred to in Article 170 of the VAT Directive.</p>

            <p>As the European Commission rightly stated in its written observations, the purpose of the Eighth Directive is not to determine either the conditions under which a right to refund may be exercised, or the scope of that right.

            <p>In this connection, it should be noted that the right of a taxable person established in a Member State to obtain the refund of VAT paid in another Member State, in the manner governed by the Eighth Directive, is the counterpart of such a person's right established by the VAT Directive to deduct input VAT in his own Member State (judgment of 25 October 2012, Daimler and Widex, C‑318/11 and C‑319/11, EU:C:2012:666, paragraph 41 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>According to the settled case-law of the Court, that right to deduct is an integral part of the VAT scheme and in principle may not be limited.

            <p>The deduction system, and accordingly the refund system, is intended to relieve the operator entirely of the burden of the VAT payable or paid in the course of all his economic activities.

            <p>With regard, in the first place, to the question whether SMS Meer can be considered to be a taxable person within the meaning of Article 1 of the Eighth Directive, it should be borne in mind that that provision lays down, in essence, two cumulative conditions. First, the taxable person in question must not possess, during the period referred to in Article 7(1) of that directive, any establishment in the Member State from which he is claiming a refund. Secondly, he must not during that period have made any supplies of goods or services in respect of which the place of supply is deemed to be in that Member State, with the exception of certain supplies of specified services (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 February 2014, E.ON Global Commodities, C‑323/12, EU:C:2014:53, paragraph 42).</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is not disputed that SMS Meer meets those conditions.

It is settled case-law that a person who incurs investment expenditure with the intention, confirmed by objective evidence, of carrying out an economic activity within the meaning of Article 9(1) of the VAT Directive must be regarded as a taxable person (see, to that effect, judgments of 14 February 1985, Rompelman, 268/83, EU:C:1985:74, paragraph 24; of 29 February 1996, INZO, C‑110/94, EU:C:1996:67, paragraph 17; and of 22 October 2015, Sveda, C‑126/14, EU:C:2015:712, paragraph 20 and the case-law cited).</p>

Accordingly, the importation of those goods had taken place for the purpose of, ultimately, exportation, within the meaning of Article 146 of the VAT Directive, a transaction to which Article 170 of that directive refers.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, it must be considered that SMS Meer, on importation of the goods at issue into Romania, acquired the right to a refund of the VAT paid.</p>

            <p>The existence of that right is not called into question by the fact that the transaction in the context of which the goods at issue were to be used was in the end not carried out and that SMS Meer was not able to provide proof, required by the tax authority, of the subsequent movements of those goods.</p>

            <p>It is settled case-law of the Court that, in the absence of fraud or abuse, and subject to any adjustments which may be made in accordance with the conditions laid down by the VAT Directive, the right of refund, once it has arisen, is retained (see, by analogy, judgment of 22 March 2012, Klub, C‑153/11, EU:C:2012:163, paragraph 46 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>More specifically, where the taxable person has been unable to use the goods or services which gave rise to a refund in the context of the planned transaction by reason of circumstances beyond his control, the right of refund is retained since, in such a case, there is no risk of fraud or abuse capable of justifying a refusal to refund (see, by analogy, judgment of 22 March 2012, Klub, C‑153/11, EU:C:2012:163, paragraph 47 and the case-law cited). Such considerations have all the more reason to apply to a taxable person, such as SMS Meer, given that, according to its statements, it had no other use for the goods at issue.</p>

            <p>It follows that, in the present case, to the extent that the national tax authorities have no objective evidence proving that the right to a refund arose abusively or fraudulently, which is ultimately for the referring court to verify, events following the importation are irrelevant. In particular, requiring SMS Meer to produce proof that the goods at issue were ultimately exported from Romania is tantamount, in reality, to adding a substantive condition to the eligibility for refund, which is not provided for by the VAT system.</p>

            <p>In the light of all the foregoing considerations, the answer to the questions asked is that the Eighth Directive, read in conjunction with Article 170 of the VAT Directive, must be interpreted as precluding a refusal by a Member State to refund the VAT paid on the importation of goods to a taxable person who is not established on its territory in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings where, at the time of importation, the performance of the contract in connection with which the taxable person purchased and imported those goods was suspended, the transaction for which they were intended to be used was in the end not carried out, and the taxable person did not provide proof of their subsequent movements.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Tenth Chamber) hereby rules: Eighth Council Directive 79/1072/EEC of 6 December 1979 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to turnover taxes -- Arrangements for the refund of value added tax to taxable persons not established in the territory of the country, read in conjunction with Article 170 of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax, must be interpreted as precluding a refusal by a Member State to refund the value added tax paid on the importation of goods to a taxable person who is not established on its territory in circumstances such as those in the main proceedings where, at the time of importation, the performance of the contract in connection with which the taxable person purchased and imported those goods was suspended, the transaction for which they were intended to be used was in the end not carried out, and the taxable person did not provide proof of their subsequent movements.</p>
