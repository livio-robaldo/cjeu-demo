This Framework Decision is not designed to regulate the forms and methods, including procedural requirements, that are used to achieve the results specified in this Framework Decision, which are a matter for the national laws of the Member States.</p>

This right includes the right of the person concerned to appear in person at the trial. In order to exercise this right, the person concerned needs to be aware of the scheduled trial. Under this Framework Decision, the person's awareness of the trial should be ensured by each Member State in accordance with its national law, it being understood that this must comply with the requirements of that Convention. In accordance with the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, when considering whether the way in which the information is provided is sufficient to ensure the person's awareness of the trial, particular attention could, where appropriate, also be paid to the diligence exercised by the person concerned in order to receive information addressed to him or her. ...</p>

                <p>This Framework Decision is limited to refining the definition of grounds for non-recognition in instruments implementing the principle of mutual recognition. Therefore, provisions such as those relating to the right to a retrial have a scope which is limited to the definition of these grounds for non-recognition. They are not designed to harmonise national legislation. This Framework Decision is without prejudice to future instruments of the European Union designed to approximate the laws of the Member States in the field of criminal law.</p>

On the other hand, that is not the case where the judge merely ruled on questions of law, such as in an appeal in cassation.</p>

            <p>The referring court states that the rights of the defence are part of the right to a fair trial within the meaning of Article 6 of the ECHR and Article 47 of the Charter, with the result that once a Member State has established an appeal procedure, it is required to ensure that the person concerned enjoys, within the framework of that procedure, the fundamental guarantees laid down in those provisions. Thus, although the person concerned has the right to waive his rights of defence, the fact remains that, as the European Court of Human Rights has held, the criminal court which is called upon once more to rule on the guilt of the person concerned may not issue a ruling without a direct assessment of the evidence presented in person by the accused who wishes to prove that he did not commit the purportedly criminal act. In such a case, the mere fact that the person concerned was able to exercise his rights of defence at first instance is, therefore, insufficient for it to be concluded that the requirements laid down in Article 6 ECHR and Article 47 of the Charter have been met.</p>

            <p>The referring court notes, however, that such an interpretation is not shared by a number of other Member States. It could therefore be argued that, once it has been established that the rights of the defence of the person concerned were fully upheld in the proceedings at first instance, the principle of mutual trust requires it to be held that the authorities of the issuing Member State have not disregarded the fundamental rights recognised by EU law in the context of other possible proceedings. Nevertheless, the Court has not yet ruled in that regard.</p>

In particular, the referring court asks whether, in such a case, it is the appeal proceedings which must be regarded as decisive for the purposes of the application of that provision.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, it should be borne in mind that, according to the Court's settled case-law, Framework Decision 2002/584 is based on the principle of mutual recognition, which itself, as a `cornerstone' of judicial cooperation, as is apparent from recital 6 of that Framework Decision, is based on the mutual trust between Member States with a view to achieving the objective set for the Union to become an area of freedom, security and justice (see, to that effect, judgment of 10 November 2016, Kovalkovas, C‑477/16 PPU, EU:C:2016:861, paragraphs 25 to 28 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>To that end, Article 1(2) of the Framework Decision lays down the rule that Member States are required to execute any European arrest warrant on the basis of the principle of mutual recognition and in accordance with the provisions of that Framework Decision. Except in exceptional circumstances, the executing judicial authorities may therefore refuse to execute such a warrant only in the exhaustively listed cases of non-execution provided for by Framework Decision 2002/584 and the execution of the European Arrest Warrant may be made subject only to one of the conditions listed exhaustively therein. Accordingly, while the execution of the European arrest warrant constitutes the rule, the refusal to execute is intended to be an exception which must be interpreted strictly (see judgment of 29 June 2017, Popławski, C‑579/15, EU:C:2017:503, paragraph 19 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Although it is true that Framework Decision 2002/584, and in particular Article 4a(1) thereof, contains a number of express references to the law of the Member States, none of those references concerns the concept of a `trial resulting in the decision' within the meaning of that provision.</p>

            <p>That interpretation is also borne out by the origins of Framework Decision 2009/299. As is apparent from recitals 2 and 4 thereof, the EU legislature, having noted that the lack of uniform regulation of questions linked with decisions handed down following a trial in which the person concerned did not appear in person could, in particular, hamper judicial cooperation, considered it necessary to provide clear and common grounds for non-recognition of decisions rendered following a trial in which the person concerned had not appeared in person, but without regulating the forms and methods, including procedural requirements, which are a matter for the laws of the Member States, that are used to achieve the results specified in that framework decision (see judgment of 24 May 2016, Dworzecki, C‑108/16 PPU, EU:C:2016:346, paragraph 31).</p>

            <p>Secondly, it must be stated that the wording of Article 4a(1) of Framework Decision 2002/584 does not, of itself, make it possible to define more precisely the concept of `trial resulting in the decision' set out therein. That term is neither defined nor otherwise specified there and the title of that article merely refers to `decisions rendered following a trial at which the person did not appear in person'.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be pointed out that although Article 8(1)(c) of Framework Decision 2002/584 uses the terms `enforceable judgment' or `any other enforceable judicial decision having the same effect' and although such enforceability is decisive in determining the time from which a European arrest warrant may be issued, that enforceability is of lesser relevance under Article 4a(1) of that Framework Decision. However, it is appropriate to pay attention to the `final' nature of the `decision' or `judgment' for the purposes of interpreting Article 4a(1), as is apparent from other relevant, convergent provisions of the Framework Decision.</p>

            <p>Thus, Article 3(2) and Article 8(f) of Framework Decision 2002/584 use the phrase `final judgment' which has imposed a penalty. Article 2(1) thereof refers to `sentences', while Article 4(3) of that Framework Decision uses the term `final judgment' and Article 4(5) refers to a `person [who] has been finally judged'.</p>

            <p>It must therefore be held that the concept of `trial resulting in the decision', within the meaning of Article 4a(1) of Framework Decision 2002/584, must be understood as referring to the proceeding that led to the judicial decision which finally sentenced the person whose surrender is sought in connection with the execution of a European Arrest Warrant.</p>

            <p>Moreover, the European Court of Human Rights has held on several occasions that, where appeal proceedings are provided for, they must comply with the requirements flowing from Article 6 of the ECHR, in particular where the remedy available against the decision given at first instance is a full appeal, the second-instance court having jurisdiction to re-examine the case, by assessing the merits of the accusations in fact and in law, and thus to determine the guilt or innocence of the person concerned on the basis of the evidence presented (see, to that effect, judgments of the ECtHR of 26 May 1988, Ekbatani v.
