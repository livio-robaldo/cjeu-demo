            <p>Mr Raimund brought an action for infringement of the EU trade mark of which he is proprietor before the Handelsgericht Wien (Commercial Court, Vienna, Austria), so that Ms Aigner would be prohibited from using the sign `Baucherlwärmer' for goods and services in the classes covered by that mark. Ms Aigner, who is the defendant in the main proceedings and claimed, in particular, that Mr Raimund had obtained that mark improperly and in bad faith, brought a counterclaim for a declaration of invalidity of that mark before the same court.</p>

The action for infringement was dismissed by the Handelsgericht Wien (Commercial Court, Vienna) on the ground that Mr Raimund had filed the EU trade mark application in bad faith.</p>

            <p>The referring court considers that the applicant in the main proceedings did indeed obtain the EU trade mark at issue in the main proceedings in bad faith and that the trade mark should therefore be declared invalid, in accordance with Article 52(1)(b) of Regulation No 207/2009. However, it is uncertain, and the question was raised by Mr Raimund in his appeal, as to whether the two lower courts were entitled to rule on the question of bad faith in the infringement proceedings, when there was no final decision on the counterclaim for a declaration of invalidity of the mark.</p>

            <p>In view of the fact that the defendant in the main proceedings is relying on an absolute ground for invalidity within the meaning of Article 52(1)(b) of Regulation No 207/2009, which, as Article 99(1) of that regulation provides, may be properly invoked in an action for infringement only if the defendant brings a counterclaim based on such a ground, the Oberster Gerichtshof (Supreme Court) asks whether it is sufficient that a counterclaim has been brought, alleging that trade mark rights have been obtained in bad faith, in order for the court to be able to dismiss an action for infringement before that counterclaim has been determined (first option); or whether the action for infringement may be dismissed on that ground only if the trade mark concerned is, at the very least simultaneously, declared invalid on the basis of the counterclaim (second option); or indeed whether a claim, in the context of the infringement action, that trade mark rights have been obtained in bad faith can succeed only if the trade mark has first been definitively declared invalid on the basis of the counterclaim (third option).</p>

            <p>The referring court states that, in the present case, the success or failure of the action for infringement depends solely on the plea of invalidity. It proposes that the Court of Justice apply the second option, in so far as it follows from Article 99(1) of Regulation No 207/2009 that an action for infringement may be dismissed on account of the existence of a ground for invalidity only if, at least simultaneously, the counterclaim brought on the same ground is upheld. It considers that the mere bringing of such a counterclaim should not be sufficient but that, on the other hand, it should not be necessary to wait for the decision on the counterclaim to become final. It states that the question whether there is any obligation to wait for the decision on the counterclaim to be made final, the possible joinder of infringement proceedings and a counterclaim, and the structure of the appeal proceedings should be determined solely under national procedural law.</p>

          <content eId="para_1136__content">
            <p>The referring court also states that the option which it recommends the Court of Justice apply ensures that the plea of invalidity or relating to revocation inter partes, put forward in the context of infringement proceedings, can succeed only if the trade mark is declared invalid or revoked for the same reason in the context of the counterclaim, with effect erga omnes. In particular, the applicant in the main proceedings in the action for infringement would, if unsuccessful at first instance, have to challenge both the decision on the infringement action and the decision on the counterclaim in order to succeed on appeal. Were he to appeal only the decision on the infringement action, his appeal would be destined to fail because the decision on the counterclaim, which is res judicata, would a priori preclude the infringement action being successful.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the Oberster Gerichtshof (Supreme Court) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following questions to the Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling: `1. May an action for infringement of an EU trade mark (Article 96(a) of Regulation No 207/2009) be dismissed on the ground of an objection that the trade mark application was filed in bad faith (Article 52(1)(b) of Regulation No 207/2009) if, despite the defendant having brought a well-founded counterclaim for a declaration of invalidity of the EU trade mark (Article 99(1) of Regulation No 207/2009), the court has not yet ruled on that counterclaim? 2. If the answer is in the negative: may the court dismiss an action for infringement on the ground of an objection that the trade mark application was filed in bad faith, if the court at least simultaneously upholds the counterclaim for a declaration of invalidity, or must the court delay the decision on the action for infringement in any event until the decision on the counterclaim is res judicata?'</p>

            <p>According to the settled case-law of the Court, the interpretation of provisions of EU law requires account to be taken not only of their wording but also of the context in which they occur and the objectives of the rules of which they form part (judgments of 19 September 2000, Germany v Commission, C‑156/98, EU:C:2000:467, paragraph 50; of 25 October 2011, eDate Advertising and Others, C‑509/09 and C‑161/10, EU:C:2011:685, paragraph 54; and of 26 July 2017, Jafari, C‑646/16, EU:C:2017:586, paragraph 73).</p>

            <p>As regards the wording of Article 99 of Regulation No 207/2009, entitled `Presumption of validity -- Defence as to the merits', which appears in section 2 of Title X of that regulation, relating to disputes concerning the infringement and validity of EU trade marks, that provision states in paragraph 1 that the EU trade mark courts are to treat the EU trade mark as valid unless its validity is put in issue by the defendant with a counterclaim for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity.</p>

            <p>Whilst it is thus apparent from that provision that an EU trade mark is presumed to be valid, a presumption which, in the context of infringement proceedings, may be rebutted by a counterclaim for a declaration of invalidity, it cannot be determined on the basis of the wording of that provision alone whether, where a defendant in an infringement action challenges that action on the basis of a ground for invalidity of the mark and, moreover, brings a counterclaim for a declaration of invalidity based on the same ground for invalidity, the EU trade mark court must uphold that counterclaim before it can dismiss the action for infringement.</p>

            <p>As regards the context of Article 99(1) of Regulation No 207/2009, it must be noted that Article 104(1) of that regulation requires an EU trade mark court hearing an action referred to in Article 96 of that regulation, unless there are special grounds for continuing the hearing, to stay the proceedings where the validity of the EU trade mark is already in issue before another EU trade mark court or where an application for revocation or for a declaration of invalidity has already been filed at EUIPO.</p>

            <p>Accordingly, interpreting Article 99(1) of Regulation No 207/2009 as meaning that the fact that a counterclaim for a declaration of invalidity has been brought before an EU trade mark court is sufficient for that court to be able, even before ruling on that counterclaim, to rule on the action for infringement brought under Article 96(a) of that regulation, in reliance on the same ground for invalidity as that invoked in the counterclaim, would have the illogical effect that the rules in that regulation concerning related actions pending before different EU trade mark courts would be stricter than those concerning related actions pending before the same EU trade mark court.</p>

            <p>It follows from the Court's case-law that the requirements stemming from the principles of equivalence and effectiveness apply, in particular, to the definition of the procedural rules governing actions based on EU law (see, to that effect, judgment of 27 June 2013, Agrokonsulting, C‑93/12, EU:C:2013:432, paragraph 37 and the case-law cited).</p>

According to the referring court, such a requirement ensures that the plea of invalidity in the context of infringement proceedings, which has effect only inter partes, can succeed only if the EU trade mark is declared invalid for the same reason in the context of the counterclaim, with effect erga omnes.</p>

            <p>It must be pointed out in that regard that, as the Advocate General noted in point 86 of his Opinion, where, as in the case in the main proceedings, the same court is required to rule both on an action for infringement of a mark and on a counterclaim for a declaration of invalidity of the same mark, consistency with the decision handed down by that court in the context of the counterclaim will prevent it from delivering an inconsistent ruling in the context of the infringement action.</p>

            <p>Admittedly, the EU trade mark court is obliged to await the outcome of the counterclaim for a declaration of invalidity before ruling on the action for infringement. However, as the referring court has correctly pointed out, linking the outcome of the proceedings relating to the infringement action to the conduct of the parties in relation to the appeals against the decision upholding the counterclaim for a declaration of invalidity would in all likelihood involve serious delays to those proceedings. It should be borne in mind in that regard, as the Advocate General noted in point 89 of his Opinion, that, in so far as the parties to both sets of proceedings are the same, they have the same grounds of defence and must bear the consequences of their actions. The possibility that one of the parties may seek, through successive appeals, to delay the definitive effect of court decisions cannot therefore prevail over the court's obligation to determine the dispute brought before it.</p>
