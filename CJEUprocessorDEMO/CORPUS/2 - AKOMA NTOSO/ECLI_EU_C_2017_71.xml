A decision was made on that application on 8 December 2010 by the CGRA, whereby Mr Lounani was excluded from refugee status under Article 55/2 of the Law of 15 December 1980 and Article 1F(c) of the Geneva Convention.</p>

According to the CCE, no specific act by the MICG, even in inchoate form, falling within the scope of that type of offence, had been established, nor had the fact of any personal conduct on the part of Mr Lounani giving rise to his individual liability for the performance of such an act, been established.</p>

            <p>One of those resolutions is Security Council Resolution 1377 (2001), from which it is apparent that not only are `acts of international terrorism' contrary to the purposes and principles stated in the Charter of the United Nations, but so are `the financing, planning and preparation of, as well as any other form of support for, acts of international terrorism'.</p>

            <p>Further, it can be inferred from Security Council Resolution 1624 (2005) that acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations are not confined to `acts, methods and practices of terrorism'. The Security Council, in that resolution, calls upon all States, in order to fight against terrorism, in accordance with their obligations under international law, to deny safe haven to and bring to justice `any person who supports, facilitates, participates or attempts to participate in the financing, planning, preparation or commission of terrorist acts, or provides safe haven'. Moreover, in point 1(c), that resolution calls upon all States to deny a safe haven to any persons with respect to whom there is credible and relevant information giving serious reasons for considering that they have been guilty of incitement to commit a terrorist act or acts.</p>

According to that judgment, Mr Lounani's conviction by the tribunal correctionnel de Bruxelles (Criminal Court, Brussels) by reason of his participation in the activities of a terrorist group, even as a member of the leadership of that group, while no responsibility for terrorist offences as such was imputed to him, is not sufficient ground to hold that it can be said of Mr Lounani that there are serious reasons for considering that he committed acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 12(2)(c) of Council Directive 2004/83/EC of 29 April 2004 on minimum standards for the qualification and status of third country nationals or stateless persons as refugees or as persons who otherwise need international protection and the content of the protection granted must be interpreted as meaning that it is not a prerequisite for the ground for exclusion of refugee status specified in that provision to be held to be established that an applicant for international protection should have been convicted of one of the terrorist offences referred to in Article 1(1) of Council Framework Decision 2002/475/JHA of 13 June 2002 on combating terrorism. 2. Article 12(2)(c) and Article 12(3) of Directive 2004/83 must be interpreted as meaning that acts constituting participation in the activities of a terrorist group, such as those of which the defendant in the main proceedings was convicted, may justify exclusion of refugee status, even though it is not established that the person concerned committed, attempted to commit or threatened to commit a terrorist act as defined in the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council. For the purposes of the individual assessment of the facts that may be grounds for a finding that there are serious reasons for considering that a person has been guilty of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations, has instigated such acts or has otherwise participated in such acts, the fact that that person was convicted, by the courts of a Member State, on a charge of participation in the activities of a terrorist group is of particular importance, as is a finding that that person was a member of the leadership of that group, and there is no need to establish that that person himself or herself instigated a terrorist act or otherwise participated in it.</p>
