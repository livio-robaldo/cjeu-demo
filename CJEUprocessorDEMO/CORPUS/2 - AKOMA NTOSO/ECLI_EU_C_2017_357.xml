                <p>The provision of accurate, relevant and comparable information on the specific energy consumption of energy-related products should influence the end-user's choice in favour of those products which consume or indirectly result in consuming less energy and other essential resources during use, thus prompting manufacturers to take steps to reduce the consumption of energy and other essential resources of the products which they manufacture. It should also, indirectly, encourage the efficient use of these products in order to contribute to the EU's 20% energy efficiency target. In the absence of this information, the operation of market forces alone will fail to promote the rational use of energy and other essential resources for these products. ...</p>

                <p>Information plays a key role in the operation of market forces and it is therefore necessary to introduce a uniform label for all products of the same type, to provide potential purchasers with supplementary standardised information on those products' costs in terms of energy and the consumption of other essential resources and to take measures to ensure that potential end-users who do not see the product displayed, and thus have no opportunity to see the label, are also supplied with this information. In order to be efficient and successful, the label should be easily recognisable to end-users, simple and concise. To this end the existing layout of the label should be retained as the basis to inform end-users about the energy efficiency of products. Energy consumption of and other information concerning the products should be measured in accordance with harmonised standards and methods.'</p>

The second ground claims that the General Court misinterpreted the scope of the power delegated to the Commission by Article 10 of Directive 2010/30. The third ground criticises the General Court for infringing Dyson's rights of defence. The fourth ground is that certain evidence was distorted and disregarded. The fifth ground claims that the judgment under appeal failed to state reasons. The sixth ground asserts that the General Court disregarded the principle of equal treatment.</p>

            <p>In order to show that the energy performance of vacuum cleaners can be measured by means of a method other than that adopted by the regulation at issue, which was based on tests made with empty receptacles, Dyson states that it submitted before the General Court several items of evidence intended to show inter alia the reproducibility of a method of measuring the energy performance of vacuum cleaners by means of tests conducted with dust-loaded receptacles, namely the method in section 5.9 of harmonised standard EN 60312-1:(2013) adopted by the European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (Cenelec) ( `the Cenelec method').</p>

            <p>The Commission submits, first, that Dyson may have referred before the General Court to tests in multiple laboratories, but did not claim that these were part of a comparative testing programme with the same model of vacuum cleaner (inter-laboratory/circular testing). According to the Commission, the General Court may not have used precise technical terminology, but it did not thereby distort the evidence before it. The General Court was able to conclude that there remained doubts as to the reproducibility of the dust-loaded receptacle calculation method, as no circular testing had been done for establishing the reproducibility of that method.</p>

            <p>The Commission argues, next, that the allegation of `disregarding' evidence relates solely to the General Court's appraisal and therefore does not constitute, unless the evidence has been distorted, a point of law which can be considered on appeal. The Commission also submits that the General Court is not required to consider every item of evidence presented to it. It is clear from paragraphs 49 to 53 of the judgment under appeal that the General Court weighed the evidence submitted by the parties.</p>

            <p>It must be borne in mind that, in an appeal, the Court of Justice has no jurisdiction to establish the facts or, in principle, to examine the evidence which the General Court accepted in support of those facts. Provided that the evidence has been properly obtained and the general principles of law and the rules of procedure in relation to the burden of proof and the taking of evidence have been observed, it is for the General Court alone to assess the value which should be attached to the evidence produced to it. Save where the evidence adduced before the General Court has been distorted, that assessment therefore does not constitute a point of law which is subject to review by the Court of Justice (judgment of 18 January 2017, Toshiba v Commission, C‑623/15 P, not published, EU:C:2017:21, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>However, in its pleadings before the General Court, Dyson sought to show that, despite not being based on `circular' tests, the Cenelec method was reproducible. In points 7, 8 and 39 of its reply, Dyson argued that Cenelec's task was to ensure that all published standards were consistent, clear and accurate and took full account of the state of the art. It also produced a report from an accredited European vacuum cleaner testing laboratory stating that that method produced reproducible results, and a statement to the same effect by its Head of Competitor Intelligence, who had been involved in the process of developing that method.</p>

            <p>Consequently, the General Court could not regard it as established, as it did in paragraph 49 of the judgment under appeal, that `there remain doubts as to whether [the Cenelec method] is reproducible' without explaining why Dyson's challenge to that assertion by means of the elements mentioned in the preceding paragraph had to be rejected. More particularly, the General Court could not state that for a method of measurement to be reproducible `circular' tests had to be performed, without explaining why the contrary arguments put forward by Dyson in its pleadings were not capable of disproving that statement. While the Commission did indeed contest the reproducibility of the Cenelec method before the General Court, it is clear that Dyson argued to the contrary in its pleadings, so that it was for the General Court to rule on the point. By failing to reply to the arguments thus put forward by Dyson, the General Court infringed its obligation to state reasons under the first paragraph of Article 53 of the Statute of the Court of Justice and Article 117 of the Rules of Procedure of the General Court.</p>

Dyson states that by that plea it submitted that the Commission had exceeded the limits of the powers delegated to it by Article 10 of Directive 2010/30.

            <p>It must also be pointed out that, in paragraph 36 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court considered that it was clear from Dyson's pleadings before it that, by its first plea, Dyson was not alleging lack of competence per se on the part of the Commission to adopt the regulation at issue, but was rather in essence challenging the exercise of that competence.

            <p>However, it is clear beyond dispute from Dyson's application to the General Court that its first plea in law in support of annulment alleged that the Commission was not competent to adopt the regulation at issue. More particularly, Dyson essentially complained that in adopting the regulation the Commission had disregarded an essential element of the enabling act by taking as the method of calculating the energy performance of vacuum cleaners a method based on tests with an empty receptacle, whereas Article 10 of Directive 2010/30 required the method to reflect normal conditions of use.</p>

            <p>Identifying the elements of a matter which must be categorised as essential must be based on objective factors amenable to judicial review, and requires account to be taken of the characteristics and particular features of the field concerned (judgment of 22 June 2016, DK Recycling und Roheisen v Commission, C‑540/14 P, EU:C:2016:469, paragraph 48 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It follows from recitals 5 and 8 of Directive 2010/30 that the `provision of accurate, relevant and comparable information on the ... energy consumption' of products `plays a key role in the operation of market forces' and hence in the guiding of consumption towards products which `consume ... less energy ... during use'. Similarly, Article 1(1) of the directive provides that its aim is to harmonise national measures on information for end users on energy consumption `during use', so that they can choose `more efficient' products. Information for consumers on the energy efficiency of products during use is therefore the essential objective of the directive, and reflects a political choice falling within the responsibilities of the EU legislature.</p>

            <p>It follows that the question whether, as its wording appears to indicate, the regulation at issue seeks only to supplement and not to amend Directive 2010/30 is not relevant in the present case. As pointed out in paragraph 58 above, in any event neither of those two categories of delegated powers authorises the Commission to disregard an essential element of the enabling act.</p>

            <p>Moreover, contrary to what the General Court stated in paragraph 59 of the judgment under appeal, to understand the expression `during use' in the third subparagraph of Article 10(1) of Directive 2010/30 as referring to the actual conditions of use is not an `excessively broad' interpretation of Article 10 of the directive, but the very meaning of that specification.</p>

            <p>That conclusion is not called in question, contrary to the Commission's arguments, by the mere fact that that specification may also and consequentially be designed to exclude the taking into account of energy consumption during the manufacture, distribution and disposal of the vacuum cleaner.</p>

            <p>In the light of the forgoing, the Commission was thus obliged, in order not to disregard an essential element of Directive 2010/30, to adopt in the regulation at issue a method of calculation which makes it possible to measure the energy performance of vacuum cleaners in conditions as close as possible to actual conditions of use, requiring the vacuum cleaner's receptacle to be filled to a certain level, having regard nevertheless to the requirements concerning the scientific validity of the results obtained and to the accuracy of the information supplied to consumers, as mentioned in particular in recital 5 and Article 5(b) of the directive.</p>

            <p>In paragraph 46 of the judgment under appeal, however, the General Court accepted that tests with an empty receptacle may not reflect the usual conditions of use of vacuum cleaners, in that such tests do not take account of the accumulation of dust in the receptacles of some types of vacuum cleaner, as the Commission did not indeed contest, as may be seen from paragraphs 98 and 99 of the judgment under appeal.</p>

            <p>It is true that in paragraphs 47 to 54 of the judgment under appeal the General Court countered that finding by stating that no calculation method based on tests with dust-loaded receptacles was reproducible. The Commission puts forward the same argument before the Court of Justice. However, it follows from paragraphs 34 to 43 above that, to reach that conclusion, the General Court distorted the facts and failed to comply with its duty to give reasons, so that the Court of Justice cannot, in order to make a substitution of grounds, base itself on that assessment of fact, which was not validly made by the General Court.</p>

By the first three parts of its fifth ground of appeal, Dyson criticises the General Court for not giving sufficient reasons for its findings in paragraphs 36, 37, 52 and 67 of the judgment under appeal.</p>
