            <p>The CN was established by Regulation No 2658/87. It is based on the International Convention on the Harmonised Commodity Description and Coding System ( `the HS'), concluded in Brussels on 14 June 1983 and approved, with its amending protocol of 24 June 1986, on behalf of the European Economic Community by Council Decision 87/369/EEC of 7 April 1987 ( OJ 1987 L 198, p. 1). The CN takes six-digit headings and subheadings from the HS. Only the seventh and eighth digits form subdivisions specific to the CN.</p>

The titles of sections, chapters and sub-chapters are provided for ease of reference only; for legal purposes, classification shall be determined according to the terms of the headings and any relative section or chapter notes ... ... 6. For legal purposes, the classification of goods in the subheadings of a heading shall be determined according to the terms of those subheadings and any related subheading notes ...

They enable the assembly of two or more parts between them, in such a way that it is possible to separate them subsequently without deterioration. ... metal screws are cylindrical in shape and their thread is very tight and slightly angled; [they] are either with a non-slotted head (with sides) -- they are therefore fastened with the aid of a wrench --, or with a slotted head or with a socket. ... metal screws of all kinds are [included] under this heading, regardless of their shape and their use, including [those] of specific shape such as U-bolts (flange bolts), bolts without heads consisting of cylindrical shanks threaded at one end or along the entire length, stud bolts, composed of a short shank threaded at each end. ... Wooden screws are distinguished ... from metal screws by their truncated cone shape and by the fact that they are fitted with a cutting thread which, by rotating, clears its passage into the material. In addition, wooden screws are fitted, in the majority of cases, with a slotted head or a head with a socket and are always used without a nut. ...'</p>

            <p>Such a classification results from the objective characteristics and properties of the medical implant screws at issue in the main proceedings. The referring court states, in that regard, that those screws are designed, manufactured and sold as orthopaedic articles for the treatment of fractures in bone structures or the stabilisation of prostheses, that they are supplied with an instruction manual for the surgeon, that they can be inserted in the body only by means of specific medical tools, that the material used (steel or titanium alloy) is specifically designed to minimise the risk of rejection, that the screw thread of such screws is deeper than for `normal' screws, that the screw head is designed to reduce the risk of inflammation, that they comply with the standards laid down by the International Organisation for Standardisation guaranteeing the quality of medical products and, finally, that they are traceable with regard to recall actions.</p>

However, it observes that a closer inspection reveals that such implant screws have a unique character distinguishing them from normal screws. In that regard, it states that the thread of the implant screws is deeper than that of a normal screw and that the socket in the screw head is not of the kind found in a universal tool, but is tailored to specific medical tools.</p>

            <p>Stryker maintains that, in any event, the three types of screw at issue in the main proceedings fall under CN heading 9021, regardless of whether they are made of steel or titanium. That classification is justified, in essence, first, by the inherent intended purpose of those screws and, secondly, by the objective characteristics specific to those screws, characteristics which the Commission incorrectly failed to regard as relevant.</p>

            <p>On the other hand, according to the Commission, the decisive criterion is the analysis of the external objective characteristics of those screws. On that basis, the Commission attaches key importance to the fact that, in its view, the screws at issue in the main proceedings `entirely correspond' to ordinary screws. Therefore, the Commission claims that the purpose of those screws, namely, their use in trauma surgery, is irrelevant. The screws at issue in the main proceedings should therefore be regarded as `parts of general use of base metal' and cannot, in accordance with note 1(f) to Chapter 90 of the CN, be classified under heading 9021 thereof. Accordingly, the Commission proposes the classification of the screws at issue in the main proceedings according to their physical composition, namely under CN heading 7318 for the steel screws and under CN heading 8108 for the titanium alloy screws.</p>
