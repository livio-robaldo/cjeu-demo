            <p>On 13 March 2012, ERGO, a company operating in the insurance sector, and Ms Barlíková concluded a contract that they entitled `Mediation agreement with a tied financial agent' ( `the contract at issue'). That contract referred to Paragraph 642 of the Commercial code.</p>

            <p>By that agreement, Ms Barlíková undertook to carry on `mediation in the insurance sector' for ERGO. That activity consisted, inter alia, in submitting offers to conclude insurance contracts proposed by that company with customers. Ms Barlíková was also authorised to conclude those contracts in the name and on behalf of ERGO.</p>

            <p>Ms Barlíková was to receive a commission for the conclusion of each insurance contract, consisting in a percentage of the premium amount or the annual premium of such contract. She was entitled to advance payment of that commission as soon as the contract with the customer was concluded. However, the entitlement to the commission was acquired definitively only if the insurance contract was not terminated before three or five years.</p>

            <p>Moreover, the contract at issue stipulated that the non-payment of premiums by the customers would result in the ceasing of the entitlement to commission, if it occurred during the first few months of the insurance contract, or a proportional reduction of the amount of the commission, if it occurred after the first three months of the execution of that contract.</p>

            <p>Ms Barlíková brought several clients to ERGO. In accordance with the contract at issue, when the insurance contracts were concluded with those clients, she received, in advance, the commissions payable to her. However, three to six months after those contracts were signed, certain clients ceased to pay the premiums relating to those contracts and failed to react to the letter of formal notice demanding payment, referring to the settlement of the sums payable, sent by ERGO. Consequently, those contracts ceased automatically, pursuant to Paragraph 801 of the Civil Code. Certain clients indicated to ERGO that they had ceased to pay those premiums after losing the confidence that they initially had in that company, because it had treated them inappropriately.</p>

            <p>Following the ceasing of the insurance contracts concerned, pursuant to the contract at issue, ERGO asked Ms Barlíková to pay back the commissions received in respect of those insurance contracts, for a total amount of EUR 11421.42. Since Ms Barlíková did not pay that sum, ERGO brought an application before the Okresný súd Dunajská Streda (District Court, Dunajská Streda, Slovakia) seeking an order for payment of that sum.</p>

          <content eId="para_7600__content">
            <p>Before that court, Ms Barlíková claimed that the ceasing of those insurance contracts was the fault of ERGO. It is allegedly apparent from letters sent by several clients to that company that it had not treated them properly, in particular, by asking them to reply to numerous questions, even though the insurance contract had been concluded, and by sending them reminder letters for payment of premiums which had already been settled.</p>

          <content eId="para_7601__content">
            <p>In that context, the referring court seeks to ascertain whether Paragraph 662 of the Commercial code, which transposes Article 11 of Directive 86/653, precludes the clauses of the contract at issue pursuant to which non-payment of the premiums provided for in the contract concluded between the principal and the third party, as the case may be, terminates entitlement to commission or gives rise to a reduction of the amount of that commission in proportion to the period of execution of that contract.</p>

          <content eId="para_7602__content">
            <p>Accordingly, the referring court is uncertain whether the first indent of Article 11(1) of that directive makes it possible to take account of the characteristics specific to long-term contracts. That court observes, in that regard, that that directive does not refer to the case of partial execution of the contract. Moreover, the referring court considers that it is necessary to clarify the concept of whether the `principal [is] to blame', within the meaning of the second indent of Article 11(1) of that directive. According to that court, such clarification is important in the present case, on account of the specific set of rules applicable to the ceasing of insurance contracts, referred to in Paragraph 801(2) of the Civil Code. Pursuant to that provision, insured parties may terminate contracts by refraining from paying the premiums due, even though they could use standard ways of terminating the contract, such as giving notice or withdrawal. From a legal point of view, the ground of termination of the contract would be based on the non-payment of premiums, which constitutes a breach, by the insured party, of his obligations. That inactivity may, however, be explained by other circumstances which led the insured party to proceed in that manner.</p>

                <p>of Question 1 is correct, must Article 11(2) of Directive 86/653 be interpreted as meaning that a provision in a contract for commercial agency under which the agent is obliged to return a proportionate part of his commission if the contract between the principal and the third party is not executed to the extent envisaged, or to the extent defined by the contract for commercial agency, is not a derogation to the detriment of the agent?</p>

A commercial agent whose activity consists, as is the case in the main proceedings, in the negotiation and conclusion of the sale of insurance services does not therefore fall within the definition covered by Article 1(2).</p>

            <p>In the first place, as regards the general scheme of Directive 86/653, Article 7(1) of that directive provides that the commercial agent is to be entitled to commission inter alia where the transaction has been concluded as a result of his action. Article 10(1) of that directive specifies nonetheless that the commission is to become due `as soon as and to the extent that' the transaction has been executed or should have been executed.

            <p>However, it is apparent from Article 7(1) of Directive 86/653, read in conjunction with Article 10(1) thereof that, although the commercial agent is entitled to commission in respect of transactions that the principal concludes with clients that the agent has found, that right materialises only at the time that the transactions in question are executed or that those transactions should have been executed. It may thus be inferred from this that the commission becomes due as that execution progresses, which, in the case of long-term contracts in which execution is ongoing, such as the insurance contracts at issue in the main proceedings, is spread out over time. If the commission becomes due only in the proportion to which those transactions are executed, the right to commission is extinguished to the extent that those transactions have not been executed. The first indent of Article 11(1) of that directive must therefore be interpreted as covering also cases of partial non-execution of the contract concluded between the principal and the third party.</p>

            <p>45 By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 11(2) and (3) of Directive 86/653 must be interpreted as meaning that the clause of a contract for commercial agency, pursuant to which the agent is required to refund, on a pro-rata basis, a part of his commission in the event of partial non-execution of the contract concluded between the principal and the third party constitutes a `derogation to the detriment of the commercial agent', for the purposes of Article 11(3) of that directive.</p>

            <p>It should be borne in mind, in that regard, that Article 11(3) of Directive 86/653 prohibits agreements to derogate from Article 11(1) of that directive to the detriment of the commercial agent.</p>

            <p>It follows from the answer to the first question that the first indent of Article 11(1) of Directive 86/653 must be interpreted as meaning that the right to commission can be extinguished also where the contract concluded between the principal and the third party has been partially executed. Moreover, pursuant to Article 11(2) of that directive, commissions which the commercial agent has already received are to be refunded if the right to them is extinguished. It follows that in accordance with those provisions, the agent may be required to refund commissions already paid, to the extent that the contract concluded between the principal and the client has not been executed.</p>

            <p>Nonetheless, it should be specified that the obligation to refund the commission must be strictly proportionate to the extent to which the contract has not been executed. An obligation to refund a part of the commission proportionately greater than the extent of that non-execution would constitute a derogation to the detriment of the agent, prohibited by Article 11(3) of Directive 86/653. By contrast, a derogation to the advantage of the agent, consisting in requiring the refund of a part of the commission proportionally smaller than the extent of the non-execution of the contract remains possible.</p>

Under the law of the Slovak Republic, that alone leads, in accordance with Paragraph 801 of the Civil Code, to the automatic termination of the contracts concerned. According to the referring court, in the case in the main proceedings, the non-payment of those premiums by the clients concerned was allegedly prompted by a loss of confidence in the principal, which `lacked professionalism' with respect to those clients.</p>

            <p>It follows that the concept of `a reason for which the principal is to blame', set out in the second indent of Article 11(1) of Directive 86/653 cannot relate only to the legal reasons which led directly to the termination of the contract, but refers to the reasons which led to that termination, which must be assessed by the national court on the basis of all the relevant facts and points of law, for the purposes of determining whether the non-execution of the contract is due to a reason for which the principal is not to blame.</p>

            <p>Consequently, as regards in particular the facts at issue in the main proceedings, in order to adjudicate on the application brought by ERGO for refund of commissions and on the possible extinction of Ms Barlíková's right to commission, it is for the referring court to take into consideration all the facts of the present case, beyond the mere failure of the insured parties in their obligation to pay the premiums relating to the insurance contracts concluded, in order to establish whether that company is to blame for the non-execution of those insurance contracts.</p>

            <p>In the light of the foregoing considerations, the answer to the third question is that the second indent of Article 11(1) of Directive 86/653 must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of `a reason for which the principal is to blame' does not relate only to the legal reasons which led directly to the termination of the contract concluded between the principal and the third party, but covers all the legal and factual circumstances for which the principal is to blame, which are the cause of the non-execution of that contract.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the referring court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. The first indent of Article 11(1) of Council Directive 86/653/EEC of 18 December 1986 on the coordination of the laws of the Member States relating to self-employed commercial agents must be interpreted as meaning that it covers not only cases of complete non-execution of the contract concluded between the principal and the third party, but also cases of partial non-execution of that contract, such as non-compliance with the volume of transactions or the duration envisaged by that contract. 2. Article 11(2) and (3) of Directive 86/653 must be interpreted as meaning that the clause of a contract for commercial agency pursuant to which the agent is required to refund, on a pro-rata basis, a part of his commission in the event of partial non-execution of the contract concluded between the principal and the third party does not constitute a `derogation to the detriment of the commercial agent', for the purposes of that Article 11(3), if the part of the commission subject to the refund obligation is proportionate to the extent to which that contract has not been executed and on condition that that non-execution is not due to a reason for which the principal is to blame. 3. The second indent of Article 11(1) of Directive 86/653 must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of `a reason for which the principal is to blame' does not relate only to the legal reasons which led directly to the termination of the contract concluded between the principal and the third party, but covers all the legal and factual circumstances for which the principal is to blame, which are the cause of the non-execution of that contract.</p>
