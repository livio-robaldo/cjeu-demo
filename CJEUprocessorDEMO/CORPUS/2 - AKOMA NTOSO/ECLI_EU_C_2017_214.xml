            <p>EDA is a company incorporated under Belgian law which offers directory enquiry services and directories accessible from Belgian territory. It requested the undertakings which assign telephone numbers to subscribers in the Netherlands ( `the Dutch undertakings') to make available to it data relating to their subscribers. Since those undertakings refused to provide the data requested, on 18 January 2012, EDA submitted a dispute resolution request to</p>

            </p>
            <p>, as the national regulatory authority, took a decision on EDA's request by adopting the following measures. First, EDA can rely on Article 3.1 of the Bude to the extent that it uses the numbers made available to it and the related information in order to place a standard telephone directory enquiry service about the subscribers on the market. Secondly, the Dutch undertakings must make available to EDA basic data relating to their subscribers (names, addresses, telephone numbers) on fair, objective, cost oriented and non-discriminatory terms. Third, the Dutch undertakings must ensure within a reasonable period of time that the consent which they seek from their subscribers when entering into contracts, with a view to including the data concerning them in any standard directory and any directory of subscribers which is used for a standard telephone directory enquiry service is compatible with the provisions of Article 3.2 of the Bude.</p>

It points out that, according to the explanatory notes to Article 3.2 of the Bude, `the reason for that is to avoid a situation where every provider of publicly available telephone directories and directory enquiry services would have to obtain the consent of every subscriber individually for a standard listing'.</p>

In that regard, the referring court considers that the question arises, in essence, as to how to balance respect for the principle of non-discrimination and privacy in the context of that request for consent.</p>

            <p>Article 25 of the Universal Service Directive is in Chapter IV of that directive, which concerns end-user interests and rights. According to Article 25(1) thereof, the Member States are to ensure that subscribers to publicly available telephone services have the right to have an entry in the publicly available directory referred to in Article 5(1)(a) of that directive, and to have their information made available to providers of directory enquiry services and/or directories in accordance with Article 25(2) of that directive.</p>

In that connection, it is sufficient that the provider concerned ask each undertaking assigning telephone numbers for the relevant data relating to its subscribers.</p>

The refusal of undertakings assigning telephone numbers to subscribers in the Netherlands to make data relating to their subscribers available to persons requesting that information on the sole ground that they are established in another Member State is incompatible with that requirement.</p>

            <p>In the light of all the above considerations, the answer to the first question is that Article 25(2) of the Universal Service Directive must be interpreted as meaning that the concept of `requests' in that article, covers also requests made by an undertaking, established in a Member State other than that in which the undertakings which assign telephone numbers to subscribers are established, which requests the relevant information possessed by those undertakings in order to provide publicly available telephone directory enquiry services and directories in that Member State and/or in other Member States.</p>

            <p>31 By its second question, the referring court asks, in essence, whether Article 25(2) of the Universal Service Directive must be interpreted as precluding an undertaking which assigns telephone numbers to subscribers, and which is obliged under national legislation to request those subscribers' consent to the use of data relating to them for the purposes of supplying directory enquiry services and directories, from differentiating in the request for those subscribers' consent to that use according to the Member State in which the undertakings requesting the information referred to in that provision provide those services.</p>

Moreover, it is apparent from Article 25(5) of that directive that Article 25(2) thereof is to apply `subject to the requirements of Union legislation on the protection of personal data and privacy and, in particular, Article 12 of [the Directive on privacy and electronic communications]'.</p>

          <content eId="para_3818__content">
            <p>It follows that, in order to answer the second question, it is necessary to examine also whether Article 12(2) of that directive subjects the transfer, by an undertaking which assigns telephone numbers to its subscribers, of a subscriber's personal data to a third-party undertaking whose activity consists in providing publicly available directory enquiry services and directories in a Member State other than that in which that subscriber resides, to the latter's separate specific consent.</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be noted that the Court held, in paragraph 67 of the judgment of 5 May 2011, Deutsche Telekom ( C‑543/09, EU:C:2011:279), that Article 12 of that directive must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation under which an undertaking publishing public directories must pass personal data in its possession relating to subscribers of other telephone service providers to a third-party undertaking whose activity consists in publishing a printed or electronic public directory or making such directories obtainable through directory enquiry services and which does not make the passing on of those data conditional on renewed consent from the subscribers. However, first, those subscribers must be informed, before the first inclusion of their data in a public directory, of the purpose of that directory and of the fact that those data may be communicated to another telephone service provider and, secondly, it must be guaranteed that those data will not, once passed on, be used for purposes other than those for which they were collected with a view to their first publication.</p>

          <content eId="para_3820__content">
            <p>For the purposes of reaching that conclusion, the Court held, in the light of recital 39 and of the wording of Article 12(2) and (3) of the Directive on privacy and electronic communications, that, where a subscriber has been informed by the undertaking which assigned him a telephone number of the possibility that his personal data may be passed to a third-party undertaking, with a view to being published in a public directory, and where he has consented to the publication of those data in such a directory, renewed consent is not needed from the subscriber for the passing of those same data to another undertaking which intends to publish a printed or electronic public directory, or to make such directories available for consultation through directory enquiry services, if it is guaranteed that the data in question will not be used for purposes other than those for which the data were collected with a view to their first publication. The consent given under Article 12(2) of that directive, by a subscriber who has been duly informed, to the publication of his personal data in a public directory relates to the purpose of that publication and thus extends to any subsequent processing of those data by third-party undertakings active in the market for publicly available directory enquiry services and directories, provided that such processing pursues that same purpose. The Court has stated in that regard that the wording of Article 12(2) of the Directive on privacy and electronic communications does not support the inference that the subscriber has a selective right to decide in favour of certain providers of publicly available directory enquiry services and directories (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 May 2011, Deutsche Telekom, C‑543/09, EU:C:2011:279, paragraphs 62 to 65).</p>

            <p>The Court has added that, where a subscriber has consented to the passing of his personal data to a given undertaking with a view to their publication in a public directory of that undertaking, the passing of the same data to another undertaking intending to publish a public directory without renewed consent having been obtained from that subscriber is not capable of substantively impairing the right to protection of personal data, as recognised by Article 8 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 May 2011, Deutsche Telekom, C‑543/09, EU:C:2011:279, paragraph 66).</p>

            <p>It follows from the foregoing that it is the purpose of the first publication of the subscriber's personal data to which he gave his consent which is decisive for the purposes of determining the scope of that consent. It should be noted, in that regard, that Article 12(3) of the Directive on privacy and electronic communications provides that the Member States may require the consent of subscribers to be obtained also in respect of any purpose of a public directory other than the simple search of contact details of persons on the basis of their name and, where necessary, a limited number of other identifiers.</p>

            <p>Moreover, it should be noted that, regardless of where they are established in the European Union, undertakings which provide publicly available telephone directory enquiry services and directories operate within a highly harmonised regulatory framework making it possible to ensure throughout the European Union the same respect for requirements relating to the protection of subscribers' personal data, resulting in particular from Article 25(5) of the Universal Service Directive and Article 1(1) and Article 12 of the Directive on privacy and electronic communications.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, as the Advocate General stated in points 40 and 41 of his Opinion, there is no need to establish a difference in treatment according to whether the undertaking requesting the transfer of personal data relating to subscribers is established in the territory of those subscribers' Member State or in another Member State, since that undertaking collects that data for purposes identical to those for which it was collected with a view to its first publication and, consequently, that transfer is covered by the consent that was given by those subscribers.</p>
