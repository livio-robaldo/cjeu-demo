            <p>In the period at issue in the main proceedings, from 2010 to 2012, Enteco Baltic imported into Lithuania fuel from Belarus. That fuel was placed under the arrangement known as `customs procedure 42', which allows goods to be released for free circulation without being subject to VAT on importation. In the import declarations, Enteco Baltic specified the VAT identification numbers of purchasers in another Member State to whom it intended to supply the goods.

            <p>Second, Article 143(2)(b) of the VAT Directive, which derives from the amendments made by Directive 2009/69, now provides that, in order to benefit from the exemption on importation laid down in Article 143(1)(d) of the directive, the importer must provide the purchaser's VAT identification number at the time of importation.</p>

            <p>While that provision could, having regard to its wording, be interpreted as meaning that the exemption on importation must be refused where the importer, after indicating a VAT identification number of a purchaser, supplies the goods in question to a different purchaser, that interpretation would, however, be contrary to the general scheme and context of Article 143(2) of the VAT Directive.</p>

            <p>In the first place, it is apparent from recitals 3 to 5 of Directive 2009/69 that Article 143(2) of the VAT Directive lists the minimum conditions for the application of the VAT exemption on importation for which it provides. The addition of those conditions to the VAT Directive was justified by the need to prevent the system of VAT exemption being fraudulently exploited by traders taking advantage of divergences between the conditions governing the grant of the exemption on importation previously laid down by the Member States. It follows that the obligation in Article 143(2)(b) of the VAT Directive, following the amendment made by Directive 2009/69, for the importer to provide the VAT identification number of the purchaser cannot be regarded as a substantive condition of exemption, and is merely intended to remedy divergences between the Member States in the application of the exemption.</p>

            <p>In the second place, having regard to the considerations set out by the Advocate General in points 67 to 71 of his Opinion, it should be added that to adopt a contrary interpretation of that provision would be incompatible with the fact that the exemption on importation is subject to compliance with the conditions for the exemption of the subsequent intra-Community supply and, in the absence of amendment to the latter conditions -- in particular Article 138 of the VAT Directive -- by Directive 2009/69, would produce inconsistencies in the system of those exemptions.</p>

            <p>As regards the dispute in the main proceedings, in order to determine whether the transactions carried out between the importer and the purchasers following the import of the goods in question are to be classified as `supplies of goods' within the meaning of the VAT Directive, it must be assessed, as follows from points 95 to 97 of the Advocate General's Opinion, whether the power to dispose of those goods as owner was transferred by Enteco Baltic to the transporters and tax warehouses, or whether they merely played the part of intermediaries in transport and storage without that power being transferred to them. In the latter case, provided that that power was actually transferred to the purchasers by Enteco Baltic, as the order for reference implies, those transactions must be classified as `supplies of goods'.</p>

            <p>In the light of the above considerations, the answer to Questions 3 and 4 is that Article 143(1)(d) of the VAT Directive must be interpreted as precluding the authorities of a Member State from refusing an importer the right to the exemption from VAT laid down in that provision for imports of goods into that Member State carried out by him and followed by intra-Community supplies on the ground that the goods were not transferred directly to the purchaser but were handled by transport undertakings and tax warehouses designated by the purchaser, where the power to dispose of the goods as owner was transferred to the purchaser by the importer. In this context, the concept of `supply of goods' within the meaning of Article 14(1) of the VAT Directive must be interpreted in the same way as in the context of Article 167 of the directive.</p>

            <p>It should be recalled that, according to the Court's case-law, it is not contrary to EU law to require an operator to act in good faith and to take every step which could reasonably be asked of him to satisfy himself that the transaction which he is carrying out does not result in his participation in tax evasion. If the taxable person concerned knew or ought to have known that the transaction which he carried out was involved in a tax evasion scheme of the purchaser and he did not take all reasonable steps in his power to prevent the evasion, he would have to be refused the exemption (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 September 2012, Mecsek-Gabona, C‑273/11, EU:C:2012:547, paragraphs 48 and 54 and the case-law cited).</p>

The Court may nonetheless provide it with all the elements of interpretation of EU law that may be of use to it (judgment of 14 June 2017, Santogal M-Comércio e Reparação de Automóveis, C‑26/16, EU:C:2017:453, paragraph 72).</p>

It should, however, be stated here that, as the Advocate General observes in points 102 to 104 of his Opinion, the circumstance that the importer communicated with its customers by electronic means does not mean that lack of good faith or negligence on its part may be identified or that it may be presumed that the company knew or ought to have known that it was participating in tax evasion.</p>

            <p>It is not apparent from the documents before the Court that those conditions are satisfied in the situation at issue in the main proceedings. Admittedly, according to those documents, on the basis of the evidence submitted by Enteco Baltic, the Tax Inspectorate concluded that the conditions for exemption of the intra-Community supplies were satisfied and that the company could not be accused of any negligence. However, it must be stressed that the Tax Inspectorate's analysis, which in any event related only to some of the transactions at issue in the main proceedings, did not prevent the VTM from ascertaining, in a further check carried out within the applicable time limits, whether Enteco Baltic had not and could not have been aware of possible tax evasion by the purchaser with respect to all the transactions in question.</p>

            <p>The interpretation of the principle of legal certainty in the light of the considerations set out in paragraphs 97 and 98 above is not called in question by the argument put forward at the hearing by the Lithuanian Government and the Commission that the checks carried out by the Tax Inspectorate and the VTM had different objects, the former examining compliance with the conditions laid down in Article 138 of the VAT Directive and the latter looking at compliance with the conditions laid down in Article 143(1)(d) of that directive. The exemption on importation under Article 143(1)(d) of the VAT Directive is subject to the conditions being satisfied for the exemption of the subsequent intra-Community supply under Article 138(1) of the directive. According to the information in the order for reference, the decision of the VTM concerned precisely the conditions of the latter provision.</p>

            <p>As may be seen in particular from recitals 3, 4 and 7 of Regulation No 904/2010, the objective of that regulation is to combat VAT fraud and tax evasion and to contribute to the correct application of VAT. To that end, the regulation, in accordance with the second paragraph of Article 1(1), lays down rules and procedures to enable the competent authorities of the Member States to cooperate and to exchange with each other any information that may help to effect a correct assessment of VAT, monitor the correct application of VAT, particularly on intra-Community transactions, and combat VAT fraud. In particular, Article 7(1) of the regulation provides for that purpose that, at the request of a national authority, the requested authority is to communicate any information that may help to effect a correct assessment of VAT. Article 54(1) of the regulation lays down limits to the exchange of information between the national authorities, who are not required to produce the information requested in all circumstances. Consequently, and in the absence of any express provision in the regulation to that effect, the regulation does not confer on a taxable person any specific right to request the transmission of information where he is unable himself to produce evidence capable of showing that he is entitled to an exemption from VAT (see, by analogy, judgment of 27 September 2007, Twoh International, C‑184/05, EU:C:2007:550, paragraphs 30 to 34).</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 143(1)(d) and Article 143(2)(b) of Council Directive 2006/112/EC of 28 November 2006 on the common system of value added tax, as amended by Council Directive 2009/69/EC of 25 June 2009, must be interpreted as precluding the competent authorities of a Member State from refusing exemption from value added tax on importation on the sole ground that, following a change of circumstances after the importation, the goods in question have been supplied to a taxable person other than the person whose value added tax identification number was stated in the import declaration, where the importer has communicated all the information on the identity of the new purchaser to the competent authorities of the Member State of import, provided that it is shown that the substantive conditions for the exemption of the subsequent intra-Community supply are actually satisfied. 2. Article 143(1)(d) in conjunction with Article 138 and Article 143(2)(c) of Directive 2006/112, as amended by Directive 2009/69, must be interpreted as meaning that:</p>

Those documents, as also the electronic confirmations of the supply of the goods and the report of receipt issued following a movement under suspension of excise duty, are capable of showing that the goods have actually been dispatched or transported to another Member State in accordance with Article 138(1) of Directive 2006/112, as amended. 3.

In this context, the concept of `supply of goods' within the meaning of Article 14(1) of that directive, as amended, must be interpreted in the same way as in the context of Article 167 of the directive, as amended. 4. Article 143(1)(d) of Directive 2006/112, as amended by Directive 2009/69, must be interpreted as precluding an administrative practice under which, in circumstances such as those of the dispute in the main proceedings, an importer acting in good faith is refused the right to the exemption from value added tax on importation where the conditions for the exemption of the subsequent intra-Community supply are not satisfied, because of tax evasion on the part of the purchaser, unless it is shown that the importer knew or ought to have known that the transaction was involved in tax evasion committed by the purchaser and did not take all reasonable steps in his power to avoid participation in the evasion.
