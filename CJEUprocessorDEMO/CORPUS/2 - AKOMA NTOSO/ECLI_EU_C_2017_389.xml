            <p>Litdana is engaged in the activity of selling second-hand vehicles on a constant basis. During the period from 1 January to 30 October 2012, it acquired from Handicare Auto A/S, a Danish company, second-hand vehicles which it resold to natural and legal persons. All the invoices relating to the acquired second-hand vehicles contained a reference to Paragraphs 69 to 71 of the Danish VAT Law and indicated, in addition, that the vehicles being sold were exempt from VAT. Litdana applied the margin scheme referred to in Article 106(2) of the Law on VAT to the vehicles at issue when they were resold.</p>

That inspection gave rise to an inspection report dated 28 April 2014, in which the Regional Tax Inspectorate found that Litdana had not been justified in applying the margin scheme to the 25 second-hand vehicles that it had acquired from Handicare Auto and resold to natural and legal persons, since Handicare Auto had not applied the margin scheme to the vehicles sold. The Regional Tax Inspectorate therefore required Litdana to pay VAT in the amount of EUR 15745.48.</p>

In doing so, first, the State Tax Inspectorate did not take account of the fact that the invoices presented by Handicare Auto indicated that the vehicles being sold were exempt from VAT and contained a reference to Paragraphs 69 to 71 of the Danish VAT Law and, secondly, the Tax Disputes Commission stated that Litdana, acting with care, should have contacted Handicare Auto in order to obtain confirmation that the vehicles were sold under the margin scheme, or asked the Danish tax authorities whether that company had transmitted the data on the supply of the vehicles at issue to the electronic database of the VAT Information Exchange System (VIES).</p>

            <p>It is not in dispute that the mention `Sections 69-71' referring to the relevant provisions of Danish law and appearing on the invoices received by Litdana must be understood as corresponding, in essence, to the mention `Margin scheme -- Second-hand goods' which, pursuant to Article 226(14) of the VAT Directive, is required on invoices where the special arrangements applicable to second-hand goods are applied. Moreover, it is not apparent from the order for reference or the observations submitted to the Court by the parties in the main proceedings that the question of the conformity of the invoices received by Litdana with the requirements laid down in Article 226 of the VAT Directive arises in the main proceedings.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, it should be noted that the scheme for the taxation of the profit margin made by the taxable dealer on the supply of second-hand goods, such as those at issue in the main proceedings, constitutes a special arrangement for VAT, derogating from the general scheme of the VAT Directive. Consequently, Article 314 of that directive, which identifies the cases in which this special arrangement is to be applied, must be construed narrowly (see judgment of 19 July 2012, Bawaria Motors, C‑160/11, EU:C:2012:492, paragraphs 28 and 29 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>As is apparent from Articles 314 and 315 of the VAT Directive, the margin scheme enables a taxable dealer to charge VAT only on the profit margin made on the resale of second-hand goods, works of art, collectors' items or antiques acquired from a person referred to in Article 314(a) to (d) of the VAT Directive, the profit margin corresponding to the difference between the selling price charged by the taxable dealer for the goods and the purchase price.</p>

            <p>The objective of the margin scheme, as is clear from recital 51 of the VAT Directive, is to avoid double taxation and distortions of competition between taxable persons in the area of second-hand goods, works of art, collectors' items or antiques (see, to that effect, judgment of 3 March 2011, Auto Nikolovi, C‑203/10, EU:C:2011:118, paragraph 47 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>The conditions that must be fulfilled for the purpose of enabling a taxable person to apply the margin scheme are set out in Article 314 of the VAT Directive. That article, in addition to specifying the types of goods that a taxable dealer may supply under the margin scheme, lists in points (a) to (d) the persons from one of whom the taxable dealer must acquire those goods, thus enabling him to apply that special arrangement. Those different persons have in common that they could not deduct any of the input tax paid on the purchase of those goods and therefore bore that tax in its entirety (see, to that effect, judgment of 19 July 2012, Bawaria Motors, C‑160/11, EU:C:2012:492, paragraph 37).</p>

            <p>In the present case, it is apparent from the order for reference that the invoices received by Litdana from Handicare Auto included references relating both to the margin scheme and to exemption from VAT. Thus, invoice No 96681, which is included in the file submitted to the Court and is a typical example of the invoice issued by Handicare Auto for the supplies of goods at issue in the main proceedings, featured -- in addition to the details relating to the date of issue, the VAT identification number under which Handicare Auto supplied the goods, the full name and address of that company, the quantity and nature of the goods supplied, the unit price, the `Total DKK' price, the amount of VAT, corresponding to `0', and the `Total DKK incl. VAT' amount -- the details `Sections 69-71' and `Free of VAT'.</p>

            <p>It follows from the order for reference that the wording on the invoices issued by Handicare Auto regarding the application of the margin scheme was incorrect, because it became apparent, following a check carried out by the tax authorities, that Handicare Auto had not actually applied that scheme to the supply of the second-hand vehicles at issue. The authorities concluded that Litdana had no right to apply the margin scheme since the conditions for the application of that scheme were not met, which is why they subsequently required Litdana to pay the amount of VAT applicable.</p>

Moreover, it is not apparent in any way from the information in the order for reference that the situation in the main proceedings fell under one of the other cases envisaged in Article 314 in which the margin scheme is applied.</p>

            <p>It should be recalled, in that context, that the Court has repeatedly held that EU law cannot be relied on by individuals for abusive or fraudulent ends (judgment of 18 December 2014, Schoenimport Italmoda Mariano Previti and Others, C‑131/13, C‑163/13 and C‑164/13, EU:C:2014:2455, paragraph 43).</p>

            <p>The Court has concluded from this, first of all, in the context of settled case-law on the right to deduct VAT laid down by the VAT Directive, that it is for the national authorities and courts to refuse the right of deduction if it is shown, in the light of objective evidence, that that right is being relied on for fraudulent or abusive ends. It has held, next, that the consequence of an abuse or fraud also applies, in principle, to the right to an exemption for intra-Community supplies (see, to that effect, judgment of 6 September 2012, Mecsek-Gabona, C‑273/11, EU:C:2012:547, paragraph 54). Finally, the Court has held that, in so far as any refusal of a right under the VAT Directive reflects the general principle that no one may benefit from the rights stemming from the legal system of the European Union for abusive or fraudulent ends, such a refusal is incumbent, in general, on the national authorities and courts, irrespective of the VAT right affected by the fraud, including therefore the right to a VAT refund (see, to that effect, judgment of 18 December 2014, Schoenimport Italmoda Mariano Previti and Others, C‑131/13, C‑163/13 and C‑164/13, EU:C:2014:2455, paragraph 46).</p>

            <p>According to settled case-law, that is the position not only where tax evasion has been carried out by the taxable person himself but also where a taxable person knew, or should have known, that, by the transaction concerned, he was participating in a transaction involving evasion of VAT carried out by the supplier or by another trader acting upstream or downstream in the supply chain (see, regarding the right of deduction, judgment of 6 December 2012, Bonik, C‑285/11, EU:C:2012:774, paragraphs 38 to 40, regarding the right of exemption for an intra-Community supply, judgment of 6 September 2012, Mecsek-Gabona, C‑273/11, EU:C:2012:547, paragraph 54, and, regarding VAT reimbursement, judgment of 18 December 2014, Schoenimport Italmoda Mariano Previti and Others, C‑131/13, C‑163/13 and C‑164/13, EU:C:2014:2455, paragraphs 49 and 50).</p>

            <p>On the other hand, it is incompatible with the rules governing the right of deduction under the VAT Directive to impose a penalty, in the form of refusal of that right, on a taxable person who did not know, and could not have known, that the transaction concerned was connected with fraud committed by the supplier or that another transaction forming part of the chain of supply, downstream or upstream of the transaction carried out by the taxable person, was vitiated by VAT fraud. The establishment of a system of strict liability would go beyond what is necessary to preserve the public exchequer's rights (judgment of 6 December 2012, Bonik, C‑285/11, EU:C:2012:774, paragraphs 41 and 42 and the case-law cited).</p>

In such circumstances, it would be contrary to the principle of proportionality to require the taxable person to systematically verify, in respect of each supply, that the supplier actually applied the margin scheme, at least when there is no indication giving grounds for suspecting an infringement or fraud within the meaning of paragraph 39 of the present judgment.</p>

In that government's view, it is the fact that the invoices simultaneously include the references `Sections 69-71' and `Free of VAT' that is an indication of an infringement or fraud, within the meaning of paragraph 39 of the present judgment.</p>

            <p>While it is true that that double reference is not devoid of any ambiguity because it seems to refer both to the rules on taxing the supply on the basis of the dealer's profit margin and to those exempting the supply from VAT, it should however be noted, as the European Commission has observed, that it is not obvious that that double reference is such as to arouse the suspicions of a prudent trader who is not a VAT expert as to the existence of an infringement or fraud committed by a trader at an earlier stage. It is not inconceivable that the taxable person may interpret the double reference as confirming that the supply was carried out, pursuant to Article 314(d) of the VAT Directive, by another taxable dealer, in so far as the supply by that other taxable dealer had been subject to VAT in accordance with the margin scheme. Both the reference to exemption from VAT and the reference to the margin scheme on the invoices at issue in the main proceedings could also be interpreted by the taxable person, as Litdana submitted at the hearing, as confirming that the dealer's margin alone is being taxed, the value of the goods concerned remaining exempt, a matter which is for the referring court to ascertain.</p>
