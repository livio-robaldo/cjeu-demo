A decisive shift to a culture of prompt payment, including one in which the exclusion of the right to charge interest should always be considered to be a grossly unfair contractual term or practice, is necessary to reverse this trend and to discourage late payment. Such a shift should also include the introduction of specific provisions on payment periods and on the compensation of creditors for the costs incurred, and, inter alia, that the exclusion of the right to compensation for recovery costs should be presumed to be grossly unfair.'</p>

            <p>The parties to the dispute in the main proceedings are businessmen who, on 20 September 2010, concluded a lease contract of indefinite duration, pursuant to which the lessee, Mr Stadnicki, used the office premises belonging to the lessor, Mr Zarski, in return for the payment of rent. The lessor demanded payment from the lessee of a lump sum of EUR 40 as compensation for the costs of recovering late rent payments between 9 April 2014 and February 2015.</p>

            <p>The Sąd Rejonowy dla m. st. Warszawy (District Court, Warsaw, Poland) dismissed Mr Zarski's action, based on Article 10(1) of the Law of 8 March 2013, on the ground that, in accordance with Article 15 thereof, that law did not apply to contracts concluded before 28 April 2013. Mr Zarski brought an appeal against that decision before the referring court.</p>

          <content eId="para_8738__content">
            <p>The referring court is uncertain, first of all, whether the letting of premises is a service within the meaning of Article 2(1) and Article 3 of Directive 2011/7.</p>

            <p>In the event that the first question is answered in the affirmative, the referring court has doubts as to whether, in the case of a lease contract of indefinite duration, the commercial transaction corresponds to the contract or to the single, separate `transaction' that each rent payment constitutes. In the referring court's view, the contract is made up of a number of operations which constitute a sequence of commercial transactions. It is true that the Law of 8 March 2013 limits commercial transactions to contracts. However, uncertainty remains as to whether the EU legislature protects a legal act such as a contract or whether it also safeguards a commercial operation carried out by an economic operator, such as a payment made in return for the provision of goods or services.</p>

          <content eId="para_8740__content">
            <p>According to the referring court, it follows from Article 2(1) of Directive 2011/7, that although every contract is a commercial transaction, not every commercial transaction is necessarily a contract. Thus, several commercial transactions could be carried out under a single framework contract. In addition, the creditor's right to obtain prompt payment in a commercial transaction pleads in favour of that protection not being limited to contracts, but extended to commercial operations.</p>

            <p>If it is held that the concept of a `commercial transaction' must be understood as covering the single, separate transaction that each rent payment constitutes, the referring court asks whether the Member States may exclude, under Article 12(4) of Directive 2011/7, the application of that directive to lease contracts concluded before 16 March 2013, in cases where the late payments of rent occur after that date.</p>

            <p>The referring court points out that Article 12(4) of Directive 2011/7 uses the term `contract' and not `transaction', whereas the term `transaction' appears in several other provisions. It considers, however, that uncertainty remains as to whether or not the purpose of that directive is to protect individual permanent or periodic relationships and, accordingly, whether or not, in interpreting Article 12(4) of that directive, preference should in principle be given to the immediate application of the new law.</p>

                <p>If the answer to Question 1 is in the affirmative, where a letting contract of indefinite duration is concluded, does the contract or the single, separate `transaction', which is what each individual rental payment in return for access to the premises and utilities is, constitute a commercial transaction within the meaning of Articles 1(1), 2(1), 3, 6 and 8 (and recitals 1, 3, 4, 8, 9, 26 and 35) of Directive 2011/7?</p>

            <p>It must be observed that, according to settled case-law, the need for a uniform application of EU law and the principle of equality require that the terms of a provision of EU law which makes no express reference to the law of the Member States for the purpose of determining its meaning and scope must normally be given an independent and uniform interpretation throughout the European Union (judgment of 18 October 2016, Nikiforidis, C‑135/15, EU:2016:774, paragraph 28 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>As Article 12(4) of Directive 2011/7 makes no express reference to the law of the Member States, it should therefore be interpreted autonomously and uniformly. Such an interpretation must take into account the terms of that provision, its context and the objective of Directive 2011/7 (judgment of 10 November 2016, Kovalkovas, C‑477/16 PPU, EU:C:2016:861, paragraph 33).</p>

            <p>Accordingly, and without it being necessary to determine, in the context of the present reference for a preliminary ruling, whether the concept of `commercial transactions' can cover, as the referring court seems to suggest, the means of performance of a contract, it suffices to note that, in any event, the EU legislature was careful not to use that term in any way when it determined the scope of the power granted to the Member States under Article 12(4) of Directive 2011/7.</p>

            <p>The examination of the wording of that provision therefore leads to the conclusion that, by using the term `contracts concluded', the EU legislature intended to allow Member States to exclude from the scope of Directive 2011/7 contractual relationships concluded before 16 March 2013, in their entirety, including the effects of those contractual relationships which arise after that date.</p>

            <p>That interpretation is supported by the context of the provision at issue and, in particular, by the scope of Article 13 of Directive 2011/7.</p>

            <p>Article 13 of Directive 2011/7 repeals Directive 2000/35 with effect from 16 March 2013, while providing that that directive nevertheless remains applicable to contracts concluded before that date to which Directive 2011/7 does not apply pursuant to Article 12(4) thereof.</p>

            <p>It follows that, where a Member State has made use of the power granted to it under Article 12(4) of Directive 2011/7, contracts concluded before 16 March 2013 continue -- subject to Article 6(3)(b) of Directive 2000/35 -- to be governed by Directive 2000/35, including as regards their future effects, notwithstanding the fact that that directive is, in principle, repealed as from that date. In this case, Directive 2011/7 cannot apply to the effects of such contracts which occur as from 16 March 2013, since those effects cannot be subject to both Directive 2000/35 and Directive 2011/7.</p>

            <p>It follows from the foregoing that the claims relating to payments due after 16 March 2013 cannot fall within the scope of Directive 2011/7 where the contract, pursuant to which those payments are due, was concluded before that date and the Member State concerned has made use of the power granted to it under Article 12(4) of Directive 2011/7.</p>

            <p>Consequently, the answer to the second and third questions referred is that Article 12(4) of Directive 2011/7 must be interpreted as meaning that the Member States may exclude from the scope of that directive late payments in the performance of a contract concluded before 16 March 2013, even where those late payments occur after that date.</p>

Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Ninth Chamber) hereby rules: Article 12(4) of Directive 2011/7/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 16 February 2011 on combating late payment in commercial transactions must be interpreted as meaning that the Member States may exclude from the scope of that directive late payments in the performance of a contract concluded before 16 March 2013, even where those late payments occur after that date.</p>
