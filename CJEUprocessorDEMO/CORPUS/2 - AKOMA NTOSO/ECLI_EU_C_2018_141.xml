Such exclusivity entails a right to make decisions on the part of veterinary surgeons, which can be effective only if all, or a significant majority, of the share capital of veterinary pharmacies and veterinary pharmaceutical outlets is held by registered veterinary practitioners. Moreover, that is why the Charter of Veterinary Practitioners provides that only pharmacies or pharmaceutical outlets all of whose shareholders are veterinary practitioners may be registered in the single register of veterinary practices. However, as the requirement to submit a certificate of entry in that register was abolished by Order No 31/2015 of the Veterinary Health and Food Safety Authority, there can no longer be any guarantee that the requirement relating to the holding of share capital will be observed.</p>

Second, while Article 69 of that directive requires animal owners to be able to justify the use of any veterinary medicinal product for a period of five years, that provision does not state that animal owners have the right to administer such products themselves.</p>

            <p>50 The national court's first question must be understood as asking, in essence, whether Article 15 of Directive 2006/123 is to be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, under which veterinary practitioners have an exclusive right to retail and use organic products, special purpose anti-parasitic products and veterinary medicinal products.</p>

            <p>With regard to the first element, in general terms, attention must be drawn to the very particular nature of medicinal products, whose therapeutic effects distinguish them substantially from other goods (judgment of 19 May 2009, Apothekerkammer des Saarlandes and Others, C‑171/07 and C‑172/07, EU:C:2009:316, paragraph 31).</p>

            <p>Accordingly, the Court has accepted, in particular, that a requirement designed to restrict the sale of medicinal products to certain professionals may be justified because of the safeguards which such professionals must provide and the information which they must be in a position to furnish to consumers (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgment of 19 May 2009, Commission v Italy, C‑531/06, EU:C:2009:315, paragraph 58).</p>

If veterinary substances are not administered correctly or are administered in inappropriate quantities, either they may have no therapeutic effect or, if used in too great a quantity, they may, in particular, result in the presence of such traces in food products of animal origin and, in some instances, in the long term, in resistance to treatment for certain bacteria present in the food chain.</p>

            <p>As a consequence, the exclusive right granted to veterinary practitioners as regards trade in and use of certain veterinary substances, because they have the professional knowledge and skills required to administer those substances themselves correctly and in appropriate quantities or to instruct correctly other persons concerned, constitutes a measure that is suitable for attaining the objective of protecting public health identified in paragraph 57 above.</p>

            <p>With regard to the second element of the third condition, namely that the requirement concerned should not go beyond what is necessary to attain the objective in question, it should be noted that the protection of public health ranks foremost among the assets or interests protected by the EU Treaty and that it is for the Member States to determine the degree of protection which it wishes to afford to public health and the way in which that degree of protection is to be achieved. As this may vary from one Member State to another, Member States must be allowed a measure of discretion (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 September 2008, Commission v Germany, C‑141/07, EU:C:2008:492, paragraph 51).</p>

            <p>Such discretion is especially important where, if there is uncertainty as to the existence or extent of risks to human health, a Member State must be able to take protective measures without having to wait until the reality of those risks becomes fully apparent. In particular, Member States must be able to take any measure capable of reducing, as far as possible, a health risk, including a risk to the reliability and quality of the provision of medicinal products to the public (see, to that effect, judgment of 5 December 2013, Venturini and Others, C‑159/12 and C‑161/12, EU:C:2013:791, paragraph 60).</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Third Chamber) hereby rules: 1. Article 15 of Directive 2006/123/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 12 December 2006 on services in the internal market is to be interpreted as not precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, under which veterinary practitioners have an exclusive right to retail and use organic products, special purpose anti-parasitic products and veterinary medicinal products. 2. Article 15 of Directive 2006/123 is to be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, under which shares in establishments retailing veterinary medicinal products must be owned exclusively by one or more veterinary practitioners.</p>
