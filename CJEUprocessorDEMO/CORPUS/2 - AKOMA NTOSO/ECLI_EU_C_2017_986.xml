            <p>The Landesgericht Krems an der Donau (Regional Court, Krems an der Donau) dismissed the action without examining the merits, on the ground of lack of international jurisdiction. In its view, the action for liability is inextricably linked with the capacity of the defendants in the main proceedings as members of the committee of creditors and their obligations under the Law on insolvency. The action for liability thus derives directly from insolvency law and is closely linked with that law. It is therefore excluded from the scope of Regulation No 1215/2012 in accordance with Article 1(2)(b) of that regulation and, as a consequence, Regulation No 1346/2000 must be applied to it. In that case, the competent court is the one which opened the insolvency proceedings.</p>

As an action related to insolvency proceedings, it is covered by the exception in Article 1(2)(b) of Regulation No 1215/2012.</p>

            <p>By its question the referring court essentially asks whether Article 1(2)(b) of Regulation No 1215/2012 must be interpreted as meaning that it applies to an action for liability in tort brought against the members of a committee of creditors because of their conduct in voting on a restructuring plan in insolvency proceedings, and that such an action is therefore excluded from the scope ratione materiae of that regulation.</p>

            <p>Answering the question referred for a preliminary ruling requires a determination of the extent of the jurisdiction of the court which opened the insolvency proceedings, in so far as Article 1(2)(b) of Regulation No 1215/2012, which applies in civil and commercial matters, excludes `bankruptcy, proceedings relating to the winding-up of insolvent companies or other legal persons, judicial arrangements, compositions and analogous proceedings' from its scope.</p>

            <p>In addition, the Court has held that Regulations No 1215/2012 and No 1346/2000 must be interpreted in such a way as to avoid any overlap between the rules of law that those instruments lay down and any legal vacuum. Accordingly, actions excluded under Article 1(2)(b) of Regulation No 1215/2012 from the application of that regulation because they come under `bankruptcy, proceedings relating to the winding-up of insolvent companies or other legal persons, judicial arrangements, compositions and analogous proceedings' fall within the scope of Regulation No 1346/2000. Correspondingly, actions which fall outside the scope of Article 3(1) of Regulation No 1346/2000 fall within the scope of Regulation No 1215/2012 (see, to that effect, judgment of 9 November 2017, Tünkers France and Tünkers Maschinenbau, C‑641/16, EU:C:2017:847, paragraph 17).</p>

            <p>As follows in particular from recital 10 of Regulation No 1215/2012, the intention of the EU legislature was to adopt a broad definition of the concept of `civil and commercial matters' in Article 1(1) of that regulation and, consequently, to provide that the article should be broad in its scope. By contrast, the scope of Regulation No 1346/2000, as stated in recital 6 of that regulation, should not be given a broad interpretation (see, to that effect, judgment of 9 November 2017, Tünkers France and Tünkers Maschinenbau, C‑641/16, EU:C:2017:847, paragraph 18 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>Applying those principles, the Court has held that only actions which derive directly from insolvency proceedings and are closely connected with them are excluded from the scope of Regulation No 1215/2012. Consequently, only those actions fall within the scope of Regulation No 1346/2000 (see, to that effect, judgment of 9 November 2017, Tünkers France and Tünkers Maschinenbau, C‑641/16, EU:C:2017:847, paragraph 19 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>It is that criterion that is set out in recital 6 of Regulation No 1346/2000 in order to define the subject matter of that regulation.

            <p>With regard to the first criterion, in order to determine whether an action derives directly from insolvency proceedings, the decisive factor applied by the Court to identify the area within which an action falls is not the procedural context of the action but its legal basis. According to that approach, it must be determined whether the right or obligation which forms the basis of the action has its source in the ordinary rules of civil and commercial law or in derogating rules specific to insolvency proceedings (judgment of 9 November 2017, Tünkers France and Tünkers Maschinenbau, C‑641/16, EU:C:2017:847, paragraph 22).</p>

            <p>In the present case, according to the referring court, the action at issue in the main proceedings seeks to establish the liability of the members of the committee of creditors which, at a vote on 11 December 2015, rejected the restructuring plan proposed by VAV invest. That rejection was the reason why the winding-up proceedings were opened. The applicants in the main proceedings consider that the committee acted unlawfully, the action for liability being brought on that basis.</p>

            <p>The referring court states that in Slovak law there are two possible ways of resolving insolvency proceedings, namely restructuring proceedings and winding-up proceedings. If, in restructuring proceedings, the committee of creditors rejects the restructuring plan or does not take a decision within the time limits laid down in Paragraph 144(1) of the Law on insolvency, it is for the administrator to apply without delay for winding-up proceedings to be opened, in accordance with Paragraph 144(2) of that law.</p>

            <p>As is apparent from the order for reference, under Paragraph 127(4) of the Law on insolvency, all members of the committee of creditors are required to act in the joint interest of all the creditors, in that the task of that committee, together with the meeting of creditors, is to assess and, if appropriate, to approve, in accordance with Paragraph 133(1) of the law, the restructuring plan which must be drawn up by the insolvent debtor.</p>

            <p>The action for liability at issue in the main proceedings is thus the direct and inseparable consequence of the performance by the committee of creditors, a statutory body established when insolvency proceedings are opened, of the task specifically assigned to them by the provisions of national law governing such procedures (see, by analogy, judgment of 2 July 2009, SCT Industri, C‑111/08, EU:C:2009:419, paragraph 28).</p>

            <p>With regard to the second criterion mentioned in paragraph 27 above, it is settled case-law that it is the closeness of the link between a court action and the insolvency proceedings that is decisive for the purposes of deciding whether the exclusion in Article 1(2)(b) of Regulation No 1215/2012 is applicable (judgment of 9 November 2017, Tünkers France and Tünkers Maschinenbau, C‑641/16, EU:C:2017:847, paragraph 28).</p>

            <p>In order to ascertain whether the liability of the members of the committee of creditors may be engaged because of the rejection of the restructuring plan, it will be necessary to analyse in particular the extent of that committee's obligations in the insolvency proceedings and the compatibility of the rejection with those obligations.
