            <p>By its first ground of appeal, the Czech Republic claims that the General Court breached the principle of legal certainty by holding, in paragraphs 38 to 44 of the judgment under appeal, that the contested regulations do not require the Member States to deploy ITS applications and services on their territory. It submits that those regulations contain standard provisions relating to the binding nature of all their elements and their direct applicability in all the Member States. Furthermore, the explanatory memoranda for those regulations expressly indicate that the Commission's intention was to impose the mandatory deployment of ITS in all the Member States. By considering that the contested regulations had to be read in the light of Directive 2010/40, the General Court interpreted those regulations contra legem. Such an approach places the Member States in a legally uncertain situation, which is unacceptable from the point of view of the principle of legal certainty.</p>

Article 5(1) of that directive requires Member States to take the necessary measures to ensure that the specifications adopted by the Commission are applied to ITS applications and services `when these are deployed', while specifying that that obligation `is without prejudice to the right of each Member State to decide on its deployment of such applications and services on its territory'.</p>

In the view of the Czech Republic, the content and scope of the delegation of power in Article 7 of Directive 2010/40 are delimited by the kinds of provision expressly set out in Article 6(4) of that directive. Those kinds of provision do not allow the establishment of the supervisory body.</p>

Consequently, Article 6(4) of the directive lists, non-exhaustively only, the kinds of provision that may appear in such a specification. In any event, Article 6(4)(c) of the directive expressly mentions `organisational provisions' among the kinds of provision that may be included in a specification, which in itself justifies the Commission's power to require the Member States to establish the supervisory body in question.</p>

            <p>As regards that requirement, the Court has repeatedly held that it implies that the purpose of granting a delegated power is to achieve the adoption of rules coming within the regulatory framework as defined by the basic legislative act (judgments of 18 March 2014, Commission v Parliament and Council, C‑427/12, EU:C:2014:170, paragraph 38; of 16 July 2015, Commission v Parliament and Council, C‑88/14, EU:C:2015:499, paragraph 29; and of 17 March 2016, Parliament v Commission, C‑286/14, EU:C:2016:183, paragraph 30). The Court's case-law requires in particular that the definition of the power conferred is sufficiently precise, in that it must indicate clearly the limits of the power and must enable the Commission's use of the power to be reviewed by reference to objective criteria fixed by the EU legislature (see, to that effect, judgments of 5 July 1988, Central-Import Münster, 291/86, EU:C:1988:361, paragraph 13, and of 12 July 2005, Alliance for Natural Health and Others, C‑154/04 and C‑155/04, EU:C:2005:449, paragraph 90).</p>

            <p>That interpretation is not compatible with the wording and the spirit of that provision. A delegation of power under that provision confers power on the Commission to exercise the functions of the EU legislature, in that it enables it to supplement or amend non-essential elements of the legislative act. The requirement in the first sentence of the second subparagraph of Article 290(1) TFEU is intended precisely to ensure that such a power emanates from an express decision of the legislature and that its use by the Commission respects the bounds the legislature has itself fixed in the basic act. For that purpose, the basic act must, in accordance with that provision, lay down the limits of its conferral of power on the Commission, namely the objectives, content, scope and duration of the conferral.</p>

            <p>It is true that, as the Commission submits, the first sentence of the second subparagraph of Article 290(1) TFEU allows the EU legislature to confer on the Commission a discretion for exercising the power it delegates, a discretion which may be more or less extensive, depending on the nature of the matter in question. However, a delegation of power within the meaning of Article 290 TFEU (and any discretion it may involve) must be delimited by bounds fixed in the basic act (see, to that effect, judgment of 11 May 2017, Dyson v Commission, C‑44/16 P, EU:C:2017:357, paragraph 53).</p>

The Commission states in those guidelines that the legislature `must explicitly and precisely describe the powers it intends to delegate to the Commission', that `vague formulations ... are not possible', and that `powers should not be conferred on the Commission simply by setting up a non-exhaustive list of measures to be taken'.</p>

For that purpose, those articles require the supervisory body to be independent and impartial. In addition, they require the operators concerned to provide that body with their identification details, a description of the information service they provide, and a declaration of compliance. Finally, those articles provide that the supervisory body is randomly to inspect the correctness of the declarations of a number of operators, and to report every year to the competent national authorities on the declarations submitted and the results of the random inspections.</p>

The reasoning may therefore be implicit, on condition that it enables the persons concerned to know why the measures in question were taken and provides the Court of Justice with sufficient material for it to exercise its powers of review (judgments of 29 March 2011, ArcelorMittal Luxembourg v Commission and Commission v ArcelorMittal Luxembourg and Others, C‑201/09 P and C‑216/09 P, EU:C:2011:190, paragraph 78, and of 8 March 2016, Greece v Commission, C‑431/14 P, EU:C:2016:145, paragraph 38 and the case-law cited).</p>
