            <p>On 12 June 2015, Gate1 website informed Mr Krijgsman that it refused to accept any liability for any harm in respect of which compensation had been claimed on the grounds that, in essence, first, its area of responsibility extended only to the conclusion of contracts between passengers and air carriers, that it was therefore not responsible for changes to flight schedules made by an air carrier, and that the responsibility for informing passengers in such situations fell to the air carrier, to whom the passenger's email address had been sent in the booking file.</p>

            <p>SLM disputes that claim. It contends, first of all, that Mr Krijgsman had entered into a travel contract with a travel agent. It then emphasises that all travel agents marketing its tickets, including Gate1 website, were informed of the cancellation of the flight scheduled for 14 November 2014. Finally, it submits that it is common practice for air carriers to communicate information on flights to travel agents which have entered into the travel and carriage contract on behalf of passengers, and that those agents are required to forward that information on to passengers. In the present case, taking into account the information communicated by SLM to Gate1 website on 9 October 2014, Mr Krijgsman had to be regarded as having been informed of the cancellation of his flight more than two weeks before its scheduled time of departure.</p>

            <p>The referring court takes the view that Regulation No 261/2004 does not specify the conditions in accordance with which the air carrier is required to inform passengers of flight cancellations in the case where the contract is entered into via a travel agent or website.</p>

            <p>In those circumstances, the rechtbank Noord-Nederland (District Court, Northern Region, Netherlands) decided to stay the proceedings and to refer the following question to the Court for a preliminary ruling: `What (procedural and substantive) requirements must be imposed on the performance of the obligation to inform referred to in Article 5(1)(c) of Regulation No 261/2004 in the case where the contract for carriage has been entered into via a travel agent or the booking has been made via a website?'</p>

            <p>It is apparent from the decision to refer that the applicant in the main proceedings, a passenger who, via an online travel agency, bought a ticket for a flight operated by SLM, seeks to recover from that air carrier the compensation specified in Article 5(1)(c) and Article 7 of Regulation No 261/2004, on the ground that he had not been informed of the cancellation of that flight at least two weeks before the scheduled time of departure.</p>

            <p>It is, however, not disputed, according to that decision, that, more than two weeks before the scheduled time of departure of the flight in question, that air carrier informed the online travel agency that that flight had been cancelled, but that that agent did not inform the applicant in the main proceedings of that cancellation until 10 days before the scheduled time of departure. In this regard, it is in no way apparent from that decision that the applicant challenges the conditions in which that information was provided and its operative effect.</p>

            <p>Thus, by its question, the referring court asks whether Article 5(1)(c) and Article 7 of Regulation No 261/2004 are to be interpreted as meaning that the operating air carrier is required to pay the compensation specified in those provisions in the case where a flight is cancelled and that information is not communicated to the passenger at least two weeks before the scheduled time of departure, including in the case where that air carrier, at least two weeks before that time, had communicated that information to the travel agent via whom the contract for carriage had been entered into with the passenger concerned and that passenger had not been informed of that cancellation by that agent within that period.</p>

            <p>In the present case, as the French, Austrian and Polish Governments and the European Commission have noted in their written observations, it follows from the clear wording of those provisions that, since the operating air carrier is not able to prove that the passenger concerned was informed of the cancellation of his flight more than two weeks before the scheduled time of departure, that air carrier must pay the compensation specified in those provisions.</p>

            <p>As it follows both from Article 3(5) of Regulation No 261/2004 and from recitals 7 and 12 thereof, the operating air carrier which performs or intends to perform a flight is alone liable to compensate passengers for failure to fulfil the obligations under that regulation including, in particular, the obligation to inform set out in Article 5(1)(c) thereof.</p>

            <p>Such an interpretation is the only one which fulfils the objective of ensuring a high level of protection for passengers set out in recital 1 of Regulation No 261/2004 by guaranteeing that a passenger whose flight was booked via a third party before its cancellation is able to identify the entity liable for payment of the compensation specified in Article 5(1)(c) and Article 7 of that regulation.</p>

            <p>Nonetheless, it should be noted that the discharge of obligations by the operating air carrier pursuant to Regulation No 261/2004 is without prejudice to its rights to seek compensation, under the applicable national law, from any person who caused the air carrier to fail to fulfil its obligations, including third parties, as Article 13 of that regulation provides (see, to that effect, judgment of 17 September 2015, van derLans, C‑257/14, EU:C:2015:618, paragraph 46 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>That article provides, in particular, that Regulation No 261/2004 in no way restricts the operating air carrier's right to seek reimbursement from a tour operator or another person with whom the operating air carrier has a contract.</p>

            <p>In the light of the foregoing, the answer to the question referred is that Article 5(1)(c) and Article 7 of Regulation No 261/2004 must be interpreted as meaning that the operating air carrier is required to pay the compensation specified in those provisions in the case where a flight was cancelled and that information was not communicated to the passenger at least two weeks before the scheduled time of departure, including in the case where that air carrier, at least two weeks before that time, communicated that information to the travel agent via whom the contract for carriage had been entered into with the passenger concerned and the passenger had not been informed of that cancellation by that agent within that period.</p>

            <p>Since these proceedings are, for the parties to the main proceedings, a step in the action pending before the national court, the decision on costs is a matter for that court. Costs incurred in submitting observations to the Court, other than the costs of those parties, are not recoverable. On those grounds, the Court (Eighth Chamber) hereby rules: Article 5(1)(c) and Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 261/2004 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 February 2004 establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights, and repealing Regulation (EEC) No 295/91, must be interpreted as meaning that the operating air carrier is required to pay the compensation specified in those provisions in the case where a flight was cancelled and that information was not communicated to the passenger at least two weeks before the scheduled time of departure, including in the case where the air carrier, at least two weeks before that time, communicated that information to the travel agent via whom the contract for carriage had been entered into with the passenger concerned and the passenger had not been informed of that cancellation by that agent within that period.</p>
