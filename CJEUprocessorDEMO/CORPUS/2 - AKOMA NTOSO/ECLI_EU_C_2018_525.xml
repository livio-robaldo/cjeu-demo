            <p>In the first place, as regards the alleged inconsistency between the judgment in Case C‑331/11 and the application lodged in connection with this case, it should be noted that, in that judgment, the Court found that, by authorising operations at the landfill site in question without a site-conditioning plan and in the absence of a definite decision on its continued operation on the basis of an approved site-conditioning plan, the Slovak Republic had failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 14(a) to (c) of Directive 1999/31.</p>

            <p>Article 14(a) of Directive 1999/31 requires the operator of an existing landfill site to prepare and present to the competent authorities, for their approval, a conditioning plan for the site in question and Article 14(b) of the directive obliges the Member States, following the presentation of that conditioning plan, to take a definite decision on whether operations may continue on the basis of the plan and that directive. In that regard, Article 14(b) of Directive 1999/31 provides the Member States with two possibilities. Either the competent national authority is to authorise the continued operation of the landfill site in accordance with Article 8 of the directive or the Member State in question is to take the necessary measures to close down the site as soon as possible in accordance with Article 7(g) and Article 13 thereof.</p>

            <p>Thus, the obligation to ensure that only landfill sites satisfying the requirements of Directive 1999/31 remain operational implies the closure of landfill sites which have not been granted a permit to continue to operate (see, to that effect, judgments of 16 July 2015, Commission v Bulgaria, C‑145/14, not published, EU:C:2015:502, paragraph 30, and of 25 February 2016, Commission v Spain, C‑454/14, not published, EU:C:2016:117, paragraph 59).</p>

            <p>Consequently, if a Member State complies with the requirements laid down in Article 14 of Directive 1999/31, not by granting a permit to continue landfill operations, but by deciding to close it, that Member State must comply with the requirements of the closure procedure laid down in Article 13 of the directive.</p>

            <p>In its reply, the Commission adds that, in view of the fact that the Slovak authorities have not approved any conditioning plan for the landfill site in question, nor adopted a definite decision granting a permit to continue operations there, the site should have been closed down in accordance with Article 7(g) and Article 13 of Directive 1999/31, pursuant to Article 14(b) of that directive. In that regard, the Commission is of the view that the decision of 9 November 2016 confirming the decision of15 August 2016 to discontinue operations at the landfill site in question does not amount to a definite decision within the meaning of Article 14(b) of Directive 1999/31, since no reference is made to any conditioning plan for the landfill site in question and that an appeal has been made against that decision.</p>

            <p>As regards the seriousness of an infringement which has been established, the Commission emphasises, in the first place, the importance of the EU rules which have been infringed, namely those of Directive 1999/31 and, in the second place, the consequences of that infringement on general and individual interests, such as, inter alia, the protection of human health and the environment. In that regard, it submits that that protection requires landfilled waste not to present a risk to human health and the environment. Therefore, bearing that aim in mind, in accordance with Article 14 of that directive, a definite decision of the competent authorities is essential for the continued operation or closure of existing landfill sites. Similarly, Article 13 of the directive lays down requirements for landfill site closure and after-care procedures. In the third place, the Commission proposes, however, that it be taken into account that only one landfill site is in question and the relevant geographical area is limited to the vicinity of the site in question and that landfill waste at that site has been suspended since 30 December 2013. As a mitigating factor, regard should also be had to the measures which the Slovak Republic has taken to comply with the judgment in Case C‑331/11, even if those measures have been insufficient.</p>

Similarly, the successive efforts made in order to ensure compliance with the judgment in Case C‑331/11 should be taken into consideration, particularly the fact that, on 9 November 2016, it was decided to discontinue the landfill operations in question and to close and restore the site, with the exception of section 2 c.

            <p>The imposition of a lump sum payment and the fixing of that sum must depend in each individual case on all the relevant factors relating both to the characteristics of the failure to fulfil obligations established and to the conduct of the Member State involved in the procedure initiated under Article 260 TFEU. That provision confers a wide discretion on the Court in deciding whether to impose such a penalty and, if it decides to do so, in determining the amount (judgment of 2 December 2014, Commission v Italy, C‑196/13, EU:C:2014:2407, paragraph 114).</p>

            <p>In the present case, the facts from which the infringement found by this judgment arose, namely, first, that no definite decision, within the meaning of Article 14(b) of Directive 1999/31 on the closure of the landfill site in question was adopted within the prescribed period and, second, that there was no definitive closure of that site in accordance with Article 13 of that directive, justify the adoption of a dissuasive measure, such as an order for the payment of a lump sum, given that those facts present a risk for the environment and human health, and having regard to the necessity of effectively preventing repetition in the future of similar infringements of EU law.</p>

            <p>Relevant considerations in this respect include factors such as the seriousness of the infringement and the length of time for which the infringement has persisted since the delivery of the judgment establishing it (judgment of 2 December 2014, Commission v Greece, C‑378/13, EU:C:2014:2405, paragraph 76).</p>

            <p>In that regard, it should be noted in the first place that, despite the successive efforts made by the Slovak authorities to ensure compliance with the judgment in Case C‑331/11 and also taking into account the fact that, as of 7 January 2014, operations at the landfill site in question were discontinued, the final decision on closure and restoration of sections 2 a and 2 b of the landfill site and on discontinuance of operations at those sections was adopted only on 15 August 2016, and confirmed on 9 November 2016, that is to say more than three years after the delivery of that judgment, and the landfill site closure procedure was completed only on the Court's examination of the facts. As regards section 2 c, until such examination, no final decision on closure had been taken and the closure procedure had not even begun. The infringement therefore continued over a significant period of time.</p>

            <p>In the second place, as regards the seriousness of the infringement, it is appropriate to take account, notwithstanding the localised nature of the infringement and the Slovak Republic's cooperation with the Commission during the pre-litigation procedure relating to the present proceedings, of the impact that failure by that Member State to comply with the obligations imposed by Articles 13 and 14 of Directive 1999/31 is capable of having on the environment and on human health.</p>

            <p>Under Article 138(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court, the unsuccessful party must be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the other party's pleadings. Since the Commission has applied for costs and the Slovak Republic has been unsuccessful, the latter must be ordered to pay the costs. On those grounds, the Court (Fourth Chamber) hereby: 1. Declares that, by failing to take all the measures necessary to comply with the judgment of 25 April 2013, Commission v Slovakia (C‑331/11, not published,EU:C:2013:271), the Slovak Republic has failed to fulfil its obligations under Article 260(1) TFEU; 2. Orders that if the failure to fulfil obligations established in point 1 has continued until the day of delivery of the present judgment the Slovak Republic must pay the European Commission a penalty payment of EUR 5000 for each day of delay in implementing the measures necessary to comply with the judgment of 25 April 2013, Commission v Slovakia (C‑331/11, not published,EU:C:2013:271), from the date of delivery of the present judgment until the judgment of 25 April 2013, Commission v Slovakia (C‑331/11, not published,EU:C:2013:271), has been complied with in full; 3. Orders the Slovak Republic to pay the European Commission a lump sum of EUR 1000000; 4. Orders the Slovak Republic to pay the costs.</p>
