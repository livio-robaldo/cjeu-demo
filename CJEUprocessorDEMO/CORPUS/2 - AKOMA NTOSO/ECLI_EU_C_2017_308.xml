            <p>The appellants submit that the General Court distorted the evidence by taking the view, in paragraphs 67 and 68 of the judgment under appeal, that the issue of whether the two pages of notes had been transmitted illegally by the Italian authorities had no bearing on the legality of their use inasmuch as those documents were also found by the Commission in the course of its inspection in July 2007. They claim, contrary to what is stated in paragraph 68 of the judgment under appeal, that they challenged the legality of the inspections conducted by the Commission. They also refer to the judgment of 18 June 2015, Deutsche Bahn and Others v Commission ( C‑583/13 P, EU:C:2015:404) in support of the argument that, given the illegality of the transmission of the documents on the basis of which the Commission conducted an inspection, the documents found in the course of that inspection could not legitimately be used as evidence.</p>

            <p>As regards the first aspect of the line of argument developed in support of the first ground of appeal, the General Court was correct in stating, in paragraphs 45 and 80 of the judgment under appeal, first, that the lawfulness of the transmission to the Commission by a prosecutor or the authorities competent in competition matters of information obtained in application of national criminal law is a question governed by national law and, second, that the Courts of the European Union ( `Courts of the Union') have no jurisdiction to rule on the lawfulness, as a matter of national law, of a measure adopted by a national authority (judgment of 25 January 2007, Dalmine v Commission, C‑407/04 P, EU:C:2007:53, paragraph 62).</p>

            <p>As the Advocate General stated in point 45 of her Opinion, Article 12 of Regulation No 1/2003 pursues the specific objective of simplifying and encouraging cooperation between the authorities within the European Competition Network by facilitating the exchange of information. To that end, Article 12(1) of Regulation No 1/2003 provides that, for the purpose of applying Articles 101 and 102 TFEU, the Commission and the competition authorities of the Member States are to have the power to provide one another with, and use in evidence, any matter of fact or of law, including confidential information, while Article 12(2), in particular, lays down the conditions under which that information can be used.</p>

            <p>As regards the judicial review of fines imposed by the Commission where competition law is infringed, it must be borne in mind that the Courts of the Union must carry out the review of legality on the basis of the evidence adduced by the applicant in support of the pleas in law put forward. In carrying out that review, the Courts cannot use the Commission's margin of discretion -- either as regards the choice of factors taken into account in the application of the criteria mentioned in the guidelines or as regards the assessment of those factors -- as a basis for dispensing with an in-depth review of the law and of the facts (see, inter alia, judgment of 8 December 2011, Chalkor v Commission, C‑386/10 P, EU:C:2011:815, paragraph 62).</p>

            <p>The review of legality is supplemented by the unlimited jurisdiction conferred on the Courts of the Union by Article 31 of Regulation No 1/2003, in accordance with Article 261 TFEU. That jurisdiction empowers the Courts, beyond carrying out a mere review of legality with regard to the penalty, to substitute their own appraisal for the Commission's and, consequently, to cancel, reduce or increase the fine or penalty payment imposed (see, inter alia, judgment of 8 December 2011, Chalkor v Commission, C‑386/10 P, EU:C:2011:815, paragraph 63).</p>

            <p>Some of those arguments also seek to demonstrate the lack of coordination related to prices and, in actual fact, to call into question the very existence of the agreement. That is the case so far as the application of a common organisation of the market to the European banana market is concerned.</p>

            <p>The General Court did not therefore err in law in considering, in paragraph 473 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission was fully entitled to state that the infringement could be characterised as a restriction of competition by object.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, the General Court cannot validly be criticised for having infringed the adversarial principle on the ground that the characterisation of the agreement as having an anticompetitive object deprived the appellants of the possibility of relying on the lack of any anticompetitive effect.</p>

            <p>Under Article 184(2) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, where the appeal is unfounded, the Court is to make a decision as to the costs. Under Article 138(1) of those Rules of Procedure, applicable to appeal proceedings by virtue of Article 184(1) thereof, the unsuccessful party is to be ordered to pay the costs if they have been applied for in the successful party's pleadings. Since the appellants have been unsuccessful and the Commission has applied for costs to be awarded against them, the appellants must be ordered to pay the costs relating to the present appeal proceedings. On those grounds, the Court (First Chamber) hereby: 1. Dismisses the appeal; 2. Orders FSL Holdings NV, Firma Leon Van Parys NV and Pacific Fruit Company Italy SpA to pay the costs.</p>
