            <p>In the third place, that court considers that the principle of equivalence provided for in Regulation No 882/2004 requires that a charge, such as TSAM, should be used to fund the administrative services caused by, or for the benefit of, the chargeable persons, which, it is claimed, is not the case with regard to TSAM. The operative event for TSAM, it is claimed, relates to ownership of retail food outlets which are not exempt.</p>

                <p>28 It should be recalled at the outset that the Court has consistently held that the fact that a question submitted by the referring court refers only to certain provisions of EU law does not mean that the Court may not provide it with all the guidance on points of interpretation that may be of assistance in adjudicating on the case pending before it, whether or not that court has referred to those points in its questions. It is, in that regard, for the Court to extract from all the information provided by the referring court, in particular from the grounds of the decision to refer, the points of EU law which require interpretation in view of the subject matter of the dispute (see, inter alia, judgment of 7 March 2017, X and X, C‑638/16 PPU, EU:C:2017:173, paragraph 39 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>44 According to the settled case-law of the Court, in the context of the cooperation between the Court of Justice and national courts, instituted by Article 267 TFEU, the need to provide an interpretation of EU law which can be of use to the referring court makes it necessary for that court to define the factual and legislative context of the questions referred or, at the very least, to explain the factual circumstances on which those questions are based. The Court of Justice is empowered to rule on the interpretation or validity of EU provisions only on the basis of the facts which the national court puts before it (order of 4 May 2017, Svobodová, C‑653/16, not published, EU:C:2017:371, paragraph 18 and the case-law cited).</p>
