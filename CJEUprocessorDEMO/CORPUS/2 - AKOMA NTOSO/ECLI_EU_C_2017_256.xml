            <p>Ruling, in paragraphs 75 to 161 of the judgment under appeal, on a first set of complaints made by Ms Staelen, concerning the fact that the Ombudsman had allegedly failed, both in the initial inquiry and in the course of the own-initiative inquiry, to carry out all the checks necessary to identify and to clarify the instances of maladministration reported in Ms Staelen's complaint, the General Court began by making a number of `preliminary remarks' in paragraphs 75 to 88 of its judgment.</p>

          <content eId="para_4660__content">
            <p>The General Court held, in essence, in paragraphs 75 to 85 of its judgment, that, although the Ombudsman enjoys very wide discretion as regards the assessment of the merits of complaints referred to the Ombudsman and the way in which they are dealt with, and also in respect of the investigative tools to be used when handling a complaint or in an own-initiative inquiry, and the Ombudsman is, in that context, under no obligation as to the result to be achieved, that discretion does not exempt the Ombudsman from respecting the principle of diligence, meaning the obligation to examine carefully and impartially all the relevant elements of the individual case.</p>

        <paragraph eId="para_4661">
          <num>12</num>
          <content eId="para_4661__content">
            <p>In this connection, the General Court set out, in paragraphs 85 to 87 of its judgment, the following considerations: `85... It follows that, although the Ombudsman is free to decide to initiate an inquiry and that, if he decides to do so, he may take all the measures of inquiry which he considers justified, he must nevertheless satisfy himself that, following those measures of inquiry, he is able to examine carefully and impartially all the relevant elements in order to decide on the merits of an allegation of a case of maladministration and the way in which he deals with that allegation ... Respect for the principle of diligence by the Ombudsman in the exercise of his competences is particularly important because he is specifically given the task, under Article 228(1) TFEU and Article 3(1) of Decision 94/262, of identifying and seeking to eliminate instances of maladministration in the general interest and in the interest of the citizen concerned.</p>

          <content eId="para_4662__content">
            <p>The Ombudsman does not therefore have discretion concerning respect for the principle of diligence in a specific case. Consequently, a mere breach of the principle of diligence is sufficient to establish the existence of a sufficiently serious breach within the meaning of the case-law ...</p>

          <content eId="para_4663__content">
            <p>It should also be stated, however, that not every irregularity committed by the Ombudsman constitutes a breach of the principle of diligence ... Only an irregularity committed by the Ombudsman in the exercise of his powers of investigation the result of which is that he was not able to examine carefully and impartially all the relevant elements in order to decide on the merits of an allegation of a case of maladministration on the part of an EU institution , body , office or agency and the way in which he deals with that allegation can establish the European Union 's non-contractual liability on account of a breach of the principle of diligence ...'</p>

            <p>The General Court then went on, in paragraphs 89 to 146 of the judgment under appeal, to consider the various actions of the Ombudsman in connection with the conduct of the initial inquiry criticised by Ms Staelen, and concluded its examination in that respect by ruling, in paragraphs 141 to 146 of its judgment, that the Ombudsman had, in three respects, breached the duty to act diligently, and that those breaches were sufficiently serious to render the European Union liable. Those breaches related to the fact that the Ombudsman had</p>

            <p>Going on to rule next, in paragraphs 162 to 223 of the judgment under appeal, on a second set of complaints made by Ms Staelen, regarding manifest errors of assessment allegedly made by the Ombudsman, the General Court concluded, in paragraphs 205 and 223 of its judgment, that there was a sufficiently serious breach, by the Ombudsman, of the Ombudsman's duty to act diligently, in the investigation as to whether Ms Staelen had been discriminated against compared with the other successful candidates on account of the length of time for which her name was included on the list of suitable candidates. That sufficiently serious breach arose from the fact that the Ombudsman had concluded that there was no maladministration on the part of the Parliament, having relied in that regard on nothing more than a statement by the Parliament concerning the period of time for which the other successful candidates were included on the list of suitable candidates and having received no evidence of the dates of recruitment of those successful candidates, a statement which, it subsequently transpired, was incorrect.</p>

            <p>As regards a third set of complaints, alleging, in particular, a purported breach of the `reasonable time' principle, the General Court further held, in paragraph 269 of the judgment under appeal, that the unreasonable time taken by the Ombudsman to reply to two letters from Ms Staelen constituted a sufficiently serious breach of a rule of EU law intended to confer rights on individuals which was capable of rendering the European Union liable.</p>

            <p>Lastly, the General Court considered whether it was possible to conclude that there was any loss that might be compensated and a causal link between that loss and the various failures previously identified, and held, in paragraphs 288 to 294 of the judgment under appeal, that that was indeed the case as regards the non-pecuniary loss suffered by Ms Staelen on account of</p>

            <p>Under Article 228(1) TFEU, the Ombudsman is empowered to receive, examine and report on complaints concerning instances of maladministration in the activities of the institutions, bodies, offices or agencies of the European Union. That provision states that, in accordance with her duties, the Ombudsman is to conduct inquiries for which she finds grounds either on her own initiative or on the basis of complaints submitted to her, and that, where she establishes an instance of maladministration, she is to refer the matter to the institution, body, office or agency concerned, which has a period of three months in which to inform her of its views, before she is then to forward a report to the Parliament and the institution, body, office or agency concerned and inform the person lodging the complaint of the outcome of such inquiries.</p>

            <p>As regards the possibility that a person who has referred a complaint to the Ombudsman may put in issue the European Union's liability because of the way in which that complaint has been handled, the Court of Justice has already stated that it is appropriate to refer to its settled case-law, according to which a right to reparation is afforded where three conditions are met: the rule of law infringed must be intended to confer rights on individuals; the breach must be sufficiently serious; and there must be a direct causal link between the breach of the obligation on the author of the act and the damage sustained by the injured party. As to the second condition, the Court has, in the same context, also noted that the decisive test for finding that a breach of EU law is sufficiently serious is whether the EU institution or body concerned manifestly and gravely disregarded the limits on its discretion (judgment of 23 March 2004, Ombudsman v Lamberts, C‑234/02 P, EU:C:2004:174, paragraph 49 and the case-law cited).</p>

In that context, it should be borne in mind that the Ombudsman is merely under an obligation to use her best endeavours and enjoys wide discretion (judgment of 23 March 2004, Ombudsman v Lamberts, C‑234/02 P, EU:C:2004:174, paragraph 50).</p>

Whilst having regard to that context, account must, to that end, be taken of all aspects characterising the situation concerned, including, in particular, the obviousness of the lack of care shown by the Ombudsman in the conduct of the investigation (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgments of 30 January 1992, Finsider and Others v Commission, C‑363/88 and C‑364/88, EU:C:1992:44, paragraph 22, and of 10 July 2003, Commission v Fresh Marine, C‑472/00 P, EU:C:2003:399, paragraph 31), whether it was excusable or inexcusable (see, to that effect, inter alia, judgments of 30 January 1992, Finsider and Others v Commission, C‑363/88 and C‑364/88, EU:C:1992:44, paragraph 22, and of 4 July 2000, Haim, C‑424/97, EU:C:2000:357, paragraphs 42 and 43), or whether the conclusions drawn from the Ombudsman's examination were inappropriate and unreasonable (see, to that effect, judgment of 22 October 1991, Nölle, C‑16/90, EU:C:1991:402, paragraph 13).</p>

            <p>It must further be stated that, as the Ombudsman argued, the mere fact, highlighted by the General Court in paragraph 85 of the judgment under appeal, that it is the task of the Ombudsman to identify instances of maladministration by other EU institutions and bodies cannot justify the finding in paragraph 86 of that judgment.</p>

            <p>The Ombudsman can certainly be expected, notably in the light of the task conferred on her by the Treaty, to take particular care to comply with the obligation to act diligently by conducting an inquiry with care and caution, the Ombudsman being only obliged, however, to use all means at her disposal. Nevertheless, it cannot be inferred from the foregoing that the slightest breach by the Ombudsman of the duty to act diligently in carrying out such investigations would automatically constitute a `sufficiently serious breach' of that duty, for the purposes of the case-law referred to in paragraphs 31 and 32 of the present judgment.</p>

            <p>As regards the admissibility of the second, third and fourth parts of the first ground of appeal, it is important to note that, according to the settled case-law of the Court of Justice, it is clear from the second subparagraph of Article 256(1) TFEU and the first paragraph of Article 58 of the Statute of the Court of Justice of the European Union that the General Court has exclusive jurisdiction, first, to find the facts, except where the substantive inaccuracy of its findings is apparent from the documents submitted to it, and, second, to assess those facts. By contrast, when the General Court has found or assessed the facts, the Court of Justice has jurisdiction to review the legal characterisation of those facts by the General Court and the legal conclusions it has drawn from them (see, in particular, judgment of 3 September 2009, Moser Baer India v Council, C‑535/06 P, EU:C:2009:498, paragraph 31 and the case-law cited). Thus, the Court of Justice has repeatedly observed that the question whether the General Court could, properly in law, conclude from those facts that the EU institutions had failed in their duty to act diligently is a question of law subject to the review of the Court of Justice on appeal (see, in particular, judgment of 3 September 2009, Moser Baer India v Council, C‑535/06 P, EU:C:2009:498, paragraph 34 and the case-law cited). The same applies when determining whether such a failure is, moreover, to be classified as a `sufficiently serious breach' of EU law, and one that may give rise to the European Union's non-contractual liability.</p>

            <p>As to the substance, and as regards the second part of the first ground of appeal, it must be noted that the General Court held, in paragraph 102 of the judgment under appeal, that, by stating in point 2.5 of the decision of 22 October 2007 that the inspection carried out had confirmed what the Parliament had already indicated in its opinion, that is to say, that the list of suitable candidates had been made available to other EU institutions, when in fact that opinion contained no such indication, the Ombudsman had, due to a failure to exercise diligence, distorted the content of the document concerned.</p>

            <p>It must be pointed out in that regard that although, as has been noted in paragraph 38 of the present judgment, the Ombudsman enjoys very wide discretion in the performance of her duties, notably with regard to the way in which complaints are to be dealt with and investigated, the fact remains that, in describing the content of a document sent to the Ombudsman, in order, as in this case, to support the conclusions reached in a decision closing an inquiry, the Ombudsman has only a reduced, or even no, discretion. Consequently, the General Court was entitled, having regard to the case-law referred to in paragraph 39 of the present judgment, to rule, in paragraph 142 of the judgment under appeal, that the Ombudsman's distortion of the content of the Parliament's opinion of 20 March 2007 constituted a sufficiently serious breach capable of rendering the European Union liable.</p>

            <p>As a preliminary point, it must be borne in mind that, in paragraph 205 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court ruled that the Ombudsman had not acted with all due diligence in finding that there was no maladministration on the part of the Parliament in relation to the period of time for which Ms Staelen was included on the list of suitable candidates, relying in that respect on nothing more than a statement from the Parliament regarding the recruitment of the 22 initially successful candidates in Open Competition EUR/A/151/98 and having received no evidence of the date on which each of them was recruited, when that statement, it subsequently transpired, was incorrect. In the same paragraph, the General Court went on to conclude, referring in that respect to paragraphs 84 to 86 of the judgment under appeal, that that failure to exercise diligence could render the European Union liable.</p>

            <p>In paragraph 223 of the judgment under appeal, the General Court again stated that that failure to exercise diligence meant that the Ombudsman had wrongly considered certain facts to have been proved and therefore erroneously found that there was no maladministration on the part of the Parliament.</p>

            <p>Ruling on that plea, the General Court held, in paragraphs 202 to 205 of the judgment under appeal, that the Ombudsman had in this instance failed to fulfil the duty to act diligently by wrongly omitting to ascertain whether an assertion by the Parliament regarding the periods of time for which Ms Staelen and the other successful candidates in the competition concerned were included on the list of suitable candidates was well founded. In so doing, the General Court ruled, in essence, that the Ombudsman had, through a lack of care and caution, made an error of assessment that led to the Ombudsman concluding, wrongly, that there were no grounds for finding that there had been maladministration by the Parliament.</p>

Furthermore, the fourth ground of appeal has been upheld on the ground that the General Court erred in law when it characterised any loss of confidence by Ms Staelen in the office of the Ombudsman that may have resulted from the way in which the Ombudsman carried out the investigation in this instance as non-pecuniary loss that could be compensated.</p>

In addition, checking that her inclusion had indeed been communicated to the other institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the European Union, and by what means, was one of the expressly stated aims of the Ombudsman's inspection decision.</p>

The Ombudsman thus inferred from that document that Ms Staelen was the only candidate whose name was still on that list, and that the other institutions, bodies, offices and agencies of the European Union had, in consequence, and in view of the fact that that document could be consulted, been in a position to be aware of that information, at the very least from 14 May 2007 onwards.</p>

As to the letter of 24 January 2008, its purpose was to ask the Ombudsman whether, in view of the information contained in the letter of 19 October 2007, the Ombudsman was intending to consider the possibility of reopening the initial inquiry which had, in the meantime, been closed by the decision of 22 October 2007.</p>

Article 138(3) of those rules provides that, where each party succeeds on some and fails on other heads, the parties are to bear their own costs, but that if it appears justified in the circumstances of the case, the Court may order that one party, in addition to bearing its own costs, is to pay a proportion of the costs of the other party.</p>

            <p>In the present case, although the Ombudsman's appeal has been upheld and the judgment under appeal has consequently been set aside in part, the Court, giving final judgment on Ms Staelen's action, has, in part, upheld it. Furthermore, the Ombudsman has applied for a fair and equitable order to be made as to costs.</p>

            <p>Consequently, it must be held, in the light of the circumstances of the case, that the Ombudsman is to bear her own costs and to pay the costs incurred by Ms Staelen in relation both to the proceedings at first instance and to the present appeal.</p>

            <p>Furthermore, since the costs relating to the cross-appeal brought by Ms Staelen in the present proceedings were, as provided for by Article 137 of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, applicable to the procedure on appeal by virtue of Article 184(1) of those rules, reserved in the order of 29 June 2016, Ombudsman v Staelen ( C‑337/15 P, not published, EU:C:2016:670), the Court must, in accordance with those provisions, rule on those costs in the present judgment closing the proceedings.</p>

          <content eId="para_4787__content">
            <p>Since Ms Staelen has been unsuccessful in the cross-appeal and the Ombudsman has applied for costs, Ms Staelen must, in accordance with Article 138(1) of the Rules of Procedure of the Court of Justice, be ordered to pay the Ombudsman's costs in relation to the cross-appeal and to bear her own. On those grounds, the Court (Grand Chamber) hereby: 1. Declares the application made by Ms Claire Staelen in her response for the European Ombudsman to be ordered to pay her compensation in the amount of EUR 50000 inadmissible; 2. Sets aside points 1, 3 and 4 of the operative part of the judgment of the General Court of the European Union of 29 April 2015, Staelen v Ombudsman (T‑217/11,EU:T:2015:238); 3. Orders the European Ombudsman to pay Ms Claire Staelen compensation in the amount of EUR 7000; 4. Orders Ms Claire Staelen to bear her own costs and to pay those incurred by the European Ombudsman in relation to the cross-appeal, dismissed by order of 29 June 2016, Ombudsman v Staelen (C‑337/15 P, not published,EU:C:2016:670); 5. Orders the European Ombudsman to bear her own costs and to pay those incurred by Ms Claire Staelen in relation both to the proceedings at first instance and to the main appeal.</p>
