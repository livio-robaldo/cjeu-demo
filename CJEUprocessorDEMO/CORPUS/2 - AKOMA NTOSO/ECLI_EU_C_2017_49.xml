            <p>By the decision at issue, the Commission found that there had been an infringement of Article 101(1) TFEU and Article 53 of the Agreement on the European Economic Area of 2 May 1992 ( OJ 1994 L 1, p. 3) in the bathroom fittings and fixtures sector. That infringement, in which 17 undertakings had allegedly participated, was said to have taken place over various periods between 16 October 1992 and 9 November 2004 and to have taken the form of anticompetitive agreements or concerted practices covering the territory of Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria.</p>

            <p>On 15 July 2004, Masco Corp. and its subsidiaries, including Hansgrohe AG, which manufactures taps and fittings, and Hüppe GmbH, which manufactures shower enclosures, informed the Commission of the existence of a cartel in the bathroom fittings and fixtures sector and submitted an application for immunity from fines under the Commission notice on immunity from fines and reduction of fines in cartel cases ( OJ 2002 C 45, p. 3), or, in the alternative, for a reduction of any fines that might be imposed on them. On 2 March 2005, the Commission adopted a decision granting Masco Corp. conditional immunity from fines.</p>

            <p>On 9 and 10 November 2004, the Commission conducted unannounced inspections at the premises of various companies and national industry associations operating in the bathroom fittings and fixtures sector. Between 15 November 2005 and 16 May 2006, the Commission sent requests for information to those companies and associations, including some of the applicants in Case T‑379/10. It then, on 26 March 2007, adopted a statement of objections, which was also notified to those applicants. In the period from 15 November 2004 to 20 January 2006, a number of undertakings, not including the applicants at first instance, applied for immunity from fines or a reduction in fines.</p>

            <p>In the decision at issue, the Commission found that the infringement identified consisted, first and foremost, in the coordination, by those bathroom fittings and fixtures manufacturers, of annual price increases and other pricing elements within the framework of regular meetings of national industry associations; secondly, in the fixing or coordination of prices on the occasion of specific events such as increases in raw material costs, the introduction of the euro and the introduction of road tolls; and, thirdly, in the disclosure and exchange of sensitive business information. Those practices had followed a recurring pattern which was consistent in each of the six Member States covered by the Commission's investigation. Price setting in the bathroom fittings and fixtures industry had followed an annual cycle; specifically, the manufacturers had set price lists, which generally remained in force for a year and formed the basis for commercial relations with wholesalers.</p>

            <p>The Commission also found that the practices described above formed part of an overall plan to restrict competition among the addressees of the decision at issue and had the characteristics of a single and continuous infringement, which covered three product sub-groups -- taps and fittings, shower enclosures and accessories and ceramics ( `the three product sub-groups') -- and extended to the territory of Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, the Netherlands and Austria. As regards the organisation of the cartel, the Commission pointed to the existence of national industry associations with members active in all three product sub-groups, which it termed `umbrella associations', national industry associations with members active in at least two of the three product sub-groups, which it termed `cross-product associations', as well as product-specific associations with members active in only one of those product sub-groups. Lastly, it found that a central group of undertakings participated in the cartel in several Member States and in umbrella associations and cross-product associations.</p>

            <p>The applicants in Case T‑379/10, Keramag Keramische Werke, Koninklijke Sphinx, Allia, Produits Céramiques de Touraine and Pozzi Ginori, produced ceramic ware ( `ceramics'), and Koralle Sanitärprodukte produced shower enclosures. At the material time, the applicants in Case T‑379/10 were all subsidiaries of Sanitec Europe, the applicant in Case T‑381/10 and also an addressee of the decision at issue. In that decision, Sanitec Europe, Allia and its subsidiaries, Keramag Keramische Werke and its subsidiaries, Koninklijke Sphinx and Pozzi Ginori were collectively referred to by the Commission as `Sanitec'. Throughout their participation in the infringement alleged against them, the subsidiaries of Sanitec Europe were members of the following national industry associations of bathroom fittings and fixtures manufacturers: in Belgium, the Vitreous China-group; in Germany, the IndustrieForum Sanitär, formerly Freundeskreis der deutschen Sanitärindustrie, the Arbeitskreis Baden und Duschen and the Fachverband Sanitärkeramische Industrie; in France, the Association française des industries de céramique sanitaire ( `AFICS'); in Italy, the Michelangelo association; in the Netherlands, the Sanitair Fabrikanten Platform and the Stichting Verwarming en Sanitair; and, in Austria, the Arbeitskreis Sanitärindustrie.</p>

            <p>As regards the participation of the applicants at first instance in the infringement identified, the Commission found that, since Sanitec Europe had participated, through its national subsidiaries, throughout the infringement period alleged against them, in cartel meetings of the IndustrieForum Sanitär, the Arbeitskreis Sanitärindustrie, the Sanitair Fabrikanten Platform and the Stichting Verwarming en Sanitair and in meetings of the Michelangelo association -- associations whose other members were active in several Member States concerned by the decision at issue -- the applicants at first instance belonged to a central group of undertakings and were aware, or ought reasonably to have been aware, that the infringement found concerned at least the three product sub-groups and had an extensive geographic scope as it covered the territory of six Member States.</p>

            <p>For the purpose of setting the fines imposed on each undertaking, the Commission took as a basis the Guidelines on the method of setting fines imposed pursuant to Article 23(2)(a) of Regulation No 1/2003 ( OJ 2006 C 210, p. 2). It determined the basic amount of the fine, explaining that this calculation was based, for each undertaking, on its sales by Member State concerned, multiplied by the number of years of participation in the infringement found in the Member State in question for the relevant product sub-group, so that account had been taken of the fact that certain undertakings were active only in certain Member States or in only one of the three product sub-groups.</p>

          <content eId="para_10902__content">
            <p>As regards the gravity of the infringement, the Commission set the multiplier at 15%, taking into account the four criteria for assessing the infringement: the nature of the conduct, the combined market shares, the geographic scope of the infringement and its implementation. In addition, it set the multiplier to be applied, to take account of the duration of the infringement, at 4.33 for Keramag Keramische Werke and Germany, reflecting 4 years and 4 months' participation in the infringement, at 10 for Keramag Keramische Werke and Austria, reflecting 10 years' participation in the infringement, at 3 for Keramag Keramische Werke and Belgium, reflecting 3 years' participation in the infringement, at 8.75 for Koralle Sanitärprodukte, reflecting 8 years and 10 months' participation in the infringement, at 3 for Koninklijke Sphinx and Belgium, reflecting 3 years' participation in the infringement, at 0.66 for Allia and France, reflecting 8 months' participation in the infringement, at 0.66 for Produits Céramiques de Touraine and France, reflecting 8 months' participation in the infringement, and at 5.33 for Pozzi Ginori, reflecting 5 years and 4 months' participation in the infringement. Finally, in order to deter the undertakings in question from participating in the unlawful practices with which the decision at issue was concerned, the Commission decided to increase the basic amount of the fine by an additional amount set at 15%.</p>

            <p>After having determined the basic amount, the Commission considered whether there were any aggravating or mitigating circumstances capable of justifying adjustments to the basic amount. It did not find that any aggravating or mitigating circumstances applied in the case of the applicants at first instance, and, after the ceiling of 10% of turnover was applied, the amount of the fine imposed on the applicants at first instance in Article 2 of the decision at issue was EUR 57690000.</p>

            <p>By the judgment under appeal, the General Court rejected the majority of the pleas put forward by the applicants at first instance, but, the seven pleas relied on in Case T‑379/10 being, in essence, identical to the first five pleas and the eighth and ninth pleas relied on in Case T‑381/10 and the General Court having adopted the numbering used in Case T‑381/10, it upheld the first and third parts of the third plea in law put forward by the applicants at first instance. It found that the Commission had erred in concluding that Allia and Produits Céramiques de Touraine had participated in the infringement at issue and in concluding that Pozzi Ginori had participated in that infringement between 10 March 1996 and 14 September 2001 when its participation had been established to the requisite legal standard only in respect of the period between 14 May 1996 and 9 March 2001. Consequently, the General Court annulled the relevant part of point 6 of Article 1(1) of the decision at issue.</p>

            <p>By the first part of the first ground of appeal, the Commission claims that the General Court made an error of law when it held that the corroboration of a piece of evidence, in this case the statement made by American Standard Inc. ( `Ideal Standard') in connection with the leniency application, required a piece of evidence that would confirm the coordination of prices at the AFICS meeting on 25 February 2004. According to the Commission, the requirement of corroboration is one that tries to test the credibility of a piece of evidence. By requiring a piece of evidence necessarily to be proved by a second document and by failing to determine whether a single item of evidence may be reliable, the General Court had interpreted the requirement of corroboration too narrowly and breached the principle of unfettered evaluation of evidence.</p>

            <p>By the second part of the first ground of appeal, the Commission submits that, having erroneously found that Ideal Standard's statement needed to be corroborated by other evidence, the General Court wrongly failed to examine the probative value of the statement made by Roca SARL ( `Roca') that accompanied its leniency application, referring to the passage in the decision at issue summarising Roca's reply to the statement of objections of 26 March 2007. However, according to the Commission, that reply is not even part of the case file and, moreover, the General Court came to a diametrically opposed conclusion in the case giving rise to the judgment of 16 September 2013, Roca v Commission ( T‑412/10, not published, EU:T:2013:444), in which that reply was part of the case file. In addition, in the parallel cases that gave rise to the judgments of 16 September 2013, Villeroy &amp; Boch Austria and Others v Commission ( T‑373/10, T‑374/10, T‑382/10 and T‑402/10, not published, EU:T:2013:455), and of 16 September 2013, Duravit and Others v Commission ( T‑364/10, not published, EU:T:2013:477), the General Court rightly held that one leniency statement can be corroborated by another, and concluded that the statements made by Ideal Standard and Roca each confirmed the other, at least with regard to `low-end' products.</p>

            <p>Consequently, in the Commission's submission, in the first place, the judgment under appeal is vitiated by an inadequate statement of reasons inasmuch as the General Court failed to examine the probative value of the leniency statement made by Roca, while at the same time mentioning instead, out of context, Roca's reply to the statement of objections of 26 March 2007, as summarised in the decision at issue. In the second place, the General Court annulled part of the decision at issue in reliance on a document that was not before the Court. In the third place, the interpretation of Roca's reply constitutes a distortion of evidence, as the interpretation of that evidence in the three parallel cases cited above demonstrates. In the fourth place, the General Court's statement, in paragraph 120 of the judgment under appeal, that one leniency statement cannot corroborate another, is vitiated by an error of law.</p>

As regards Roca's reply to the statement of objections of 26 March 2007, the General Court did not err in relying on the relevant passages in the decision at issue invoked by the applicants at first instance.

            <p>In that respect, it is apparent from paragraph 120 of the judgment under appeal that, for the purpose of considering the probative value of the statements made by Roca in its leniency application, the General Court relied exclusively on recital 586 of the decision at issue, which summarises Roca's reply to the statement of objections of 26 March 2007. It concluded that the Commission could not rely on those statements, in the absence of evidence corroborating them, in order to prove that coordination of minimum prices had been put in place at the AFICS meeting on 25 February 2004.</p>

According to the Commission, by requiring, in paragraph 119 of the judgment under appeal, that that chart should by itself prove the existence of the infringement at issue, without taking into account the other evidence and additional explanations, notably those contained in Ideal Standard's leniency application, the General Court made an error of law. It also infringed its obligation to state reasons by failing to consider the probative value of the explanations given in that application. The Commission adds that this part of the ground of appeal is reinforced by the fact that the assessment of the same piece of evidence in the judgment of 16 September 2013, Duravit and Others v Commission ( T‑364/10, not published, EU:T:2013:477) led to a different conclusion, namely confirmation that that chart did have probative value.</p>

Even if the Commission discovers evidence explicitly showing unlawful contact between traders, such as the minutes of a meeting, it will normally be only fragmentary and sparse, so that it is often necessary to reconstitute certain details by deduction (see judgment of 7 January 2004, Aalborg Portland and Others v Commission, C‑204/00 P, C‑205/00 P, C‑211/00 P, C‑213/00 P, C‑217/00 P and C‑219/00 P, EU:C:2004:6, paragraphs 55 and 56).</p>

It is sufficient if the body of evidence relied on by that institution, viewed as a whole, meets that requirement (see, to that effect, judgment of 1 July 2010, Knauf Gips v Commission, C‑407/08 P, EU:C:2010:389, paragraph 47).</p>

            <p>They argue that the General Court applied an erroneous legal standard when assessing the sufficiency of the information that must be contained in a statement of objections in order to safeguard the rights of the defence. In particular, they submit that the General Court wrongly held that it was sufficient to state that `anticompetitive behaviour' took place at the meetings listed in the statement of objections of 26 March 2007, without specifying the nature of the behaviour or giving any other details. If the General Court had followed the case-law of the Court of Justice, in particular the judgment of 9 July 2009, Archer Daniels Midland v Commission ( C‑511/06 P, EU:C:2009:433), it would have annulled the decision at issue with regard to the infringement in the ceramics sector in Italy, as the statement of objections of 26 March 2007 did not set out details relating to that part of the infringement clearly enough to safeguard the rights of the defence of the applicants at first instance. According to them, the judgment under appeal sets a standard in respect of the minimum acceptable content of a statement of objections that does not meet the requirements relating to intelligible notification of charges under Article 6 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, signed in Rome on 4 November 1950 ( `the ECHR').</p>

            <p>In the alternative, the applicants at first instance maintain that the General Court's finding regarding the adequacy of the statement of objections of 26 March 2007, in paragraph 289 of the judgment under appeal, constitutes in any event a clear distortion of the contents of the case file, and that that finding is, moreover, at odds with the General Court's finding in the judgment of 16 September 2013, Wabco Europe and Others v Commission ( T‑380/10, EU:T:2013:449) in respect of the adequacy of the very same passage of that statement of objections.</p>

            <p>The Commission claims that the second part of the first ground of appeal is inadmissible because it amounts to a new plea which was not put forward at first instance. In particular, in its view, the applicants at first instance claimed before the General Court that the statement of objections of 26 March 2007 provided no facts about the Michelangelo association. In contrast, at the appeal stage, they assert that the information provided by the Commission as to the `nature' of the anticompetitive behaviour was not included in the statement of objections, which constitutes a new plea.</p>

            <p>The Commission contends that, in any event, this part of the ground of appeal is unfounded. According to the Commission, the decision taken at the end of a proceeding for infringement of Article 101(1) TFEU is not required to be a replica of the statement of objections notified in the context of that proceeding, and the obligation to observe the rights of the defence is satisfied if that decision does not allege that the persons concerned have committed infringements other than those referred to in the statement of objections and only takes into consideration facts on which the persons concerned have had the opportunity of making their views known.</p>

            <p>As regards the argument of the applicants at first instance that the General Court did not apply the legal standard set out in the judgment of 9 July 2009, Archer Daniels Midland v Commission ( C‑511/06 P, EU:C:2009:433) for assessing their ability to defend themselves effectively, the Commission contends that that argument cannot succeed. According to the Commission, that judgment is not applicable to the present case, since it is not contested by the applicants at first instance that the fact of their presence at meetings, the dates of the meetings concerned and the evidence relied on were known to them; they claim only to have been unaware of the `nature of the anticompetitive behaviour', a very vague term which does not show why the statement of objections of 26 March 2007 was insufficient. The Commission observes that the anticompetitive behaviour was described in paragraphs 256 and 393 to 400 of that statement of objections and that the applicants at first instance showed, by their response to that statement, that they understood the `nature' of the anticompetitive behaviour, and, therefore, the alleged inadequacy of the statement of objections of 26 March 2007 did not have any impact on the procedure.</p>

            <p>It should be noted that the General Court considered, in paragraphs 288 to 291 of the judgment under appeal, whether the information in the statement of objections of 26 March 2007 concerning the participation of Pozzi Ginori in the meetings of the Michelangelo association enabled the applicants at first instance to exercise their rights of defence, those applicants having asserted before the General Court that that statement of objections did not give any details of the alleged anticompetitive behaviour at the meetings of the Michelangelo association.</p>

            <p>Specifically, the General Court noted, first of all, in paragraph 288 of the judgment under appeal, that a table relating to the meetings of the cross-product association Michelangelo, contained in point 277 of the statement of objections of 26 March 2007, showed that Pozzi Ginori had participated in meetings of that association at which anticompetitive behaviour had taken place and that written evidence of such behaviour was contained in the footnotes included in that table. Next, the General Court noted, in paragraph 289 of the judgment under appeal, that the explanations advanced by the Commission with regard to Pozzi Ginori's participation in the meetings of the cross-product association Michelangelo, albeit brief, enabled the applicants at first instance to identify, precisely, the conduct alleged against Pozzi Ginori. Lastly, the General Court noted, also in paragraph 289 of the judgment under appeal, that the Commission had, in point 277 of the statement of objections of 26 March 2007, stated the nature of the activities alleged, their frequency, the precise date on which they occurred and the evidence available to the Commission. The General Court concluded, in paragraph 290 of the judgment under appeal, that the information in that statement of objections was sufficient to enable the applicants at first instance to exercise their rights of defence.</p>

            <p>It must be noted that the applicants at first instance are merely reiterating the arguments already raised before the General Court and are in fact seeking a reassessment by the Court of Justice of the nature of the statement of objections of 26 March 2007. Such an argument must be rejected as inadmissible at the appeal stage (see, by analogy, judgment of 12 September 2006, Reynolds Tobacco and Others v Commission, C‑131/03 P, EU:C:2006:541, paragraph 50 and the case-law cited).</p>

            <p>By their second ground of appeal, the applicants at first instance claim that the General Court concluded that the statement of objections of 26 March 2007 was adequate with regard to the infringement in the ceramics sector in Italy on the basis of reasoning that contradicted that applied in the judgments delivered in the related cases, and that it failed to give adequate reasons for the judgment under appeal in that respect. They submit that the assessment of that statement of objections with respect to the meetings of the Michelangelo association in the judgment of 16 September 2013, Wabco Europe and Others v Commission ( T‑380/10, EU:T:2013:449) contradicts the General Court's assessment in the judgment under appeal.

            <p>In any event, the Commission submits that the issues in the two cases are different for two reasons. First, the case giving rise to the judgment of 16 September 2013, Wabco Europe and Others v Commission ( T‑380/10, EU:T:2013:449) concerned the question whether silence could be treated as an admission of anticompetitive conduct, not the adequacy of the statement of objections of 26 March 2007. Secondly, Pozzi Ginori did not remain silent about the allegations concerning the meetings of the Michelangelo association in Italy, whereas Wabco Europe did remain silent and the General Court had to interpret the effect of such silence. In any event, the Commission adds that any error which the General Court may have made in the judgment of 16 September 2013, Wabco Europe and Others v Commission ( T‑380/10, EU:T:2013:449) is no reason to extend such error to the present case.</p>

            <p>According to the Commission, the applicants at first instance have not identified any additional evidence that they would have produced if the `nature of the [anticompetitive] conduct' in the meetings of the Michelangelo association had been specified. In those circumstances, the arguments of the applicants at first instance are speculative and unfounded and, should any error of law be identified, this should not result in the annulment of the decision at issue in so far as it concerns the Italian market. -- Findings of the Court</p>

The Court has also held that, if an addressee of a decision decides to bring an action for annulment, the matter to be tried by the EU judicature relates only to those aspects of the decision which concern that addressee. Unchallenged aspects concerning other addressees, on the other hand, do not, save in special circumstances, form part of the matter to be tried by the EU judicature (see judgment of 11 July 2013, Team Relocations and Others v Commission, C‑444/11 P, not published, EU:C:2013:464, paragraph 66 and the case-law cited).</p>
