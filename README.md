# The CJEUprocessorDEMO
A demo processing case law of the EU Court of Justice (CJEU) via SDFTagger is available for download, under the GNU Lesser General Public License. The demo includes both the source code and the corpus (635 html files publicly available on the CJEU website, which have been downloaded).

The SDFTagger library is available within the demo, please locate the homonym subfolder.

I developed the demo with Netbeans IDE 8.2.
